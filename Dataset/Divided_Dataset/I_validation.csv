"Wow, that's a big crowd. This is a big crowd. Thank you very much, everybody. Hello to Swanton and a load to Toledo. I'm thrilled to be back in Ohio with thousands of hardworking, loyal, great American patriots … days from now. Can you believe it, 43 days? We go to again win Ohio. I understand from Bob Paduchik, you know Bob? That we're going to win it by more than we did. Whether we win at nine, we won by nine points. I just came into that big, beautiful place. It's got more televisions in any plane in history. They've got televisions and closets and bathrooms on the floor, on the ceilings. I just saw that we're tied in Ohio. I don't think so … President Trump may have a slim lead in Ohio? They're not even campaigning in Ohio, come to think of it. Now, they're fake polls. They're almost as fake as the writers themselves. They're all fake. Remember last time they said, ""No, he's going to lose Ohio."" We won by nine points. So, we had seven swing states last time. President Trump is going to go home early, but it wasn't president at that time, it was just Donald Trump. He will go home early. We did. That we went home early as victors, but we had nine states. They had one of the crazy papers, New York Times. They hired that guy. They paid him millions because he never predicted wrong. He was wrong. I don't know if they had a contract where they could fire him, but they hired this guy. We had nine states. I was down at all of them on the day of election. I was going to lose all nine, and then guess what? I won every one of them. Fake polls. They're fake polls. Then we have a crowd like this. I don't know. Look, the cameras, are you turning around? These guys are bad people. I swear. They never turn the cameras around, ever. Turn them around. Turn them around. They never tell, look at them. It's just like a bunch of stiffs. Real stiffs. Why don't you turn the cameras around for once? You look back there, you can't see it. There's got to be, feels like Madison Square Garden on the ground except we have more people. Oh boy, it's always tough. You know, we go through this all the time. We're always asking them, look at these crowds. I mean, as far, you can't see it. You have this prime territory, like you should be in the real estate business. Now, as far as the eye can see back there, the cameras don't, they don't get it. You only hear it from the sound. I go home. I say to the first lady, ""Did you see that crowd we had tonight in Ohio?"" She goes, ""No, no. They just keep it on your face."" That includes Fox. They just keep it here, right here. They don't want to show. You know what they don't know and what they don't get is that showing this kind of activity is a good thing for them. It's positive for their ratings. It's really a good thing, but they don't want to do it, but I give up on it. You know what you do? You hear it because you can't have … You know when sleepy Joe Biden, he's got the circles. You knowthose big circles? You know why he has the circles? He's got four of them, because they can't … I mean, think of it. He is a guy who's failed every time he ran. We called him 1% Joe and now he's shot and he got their nomination. How the hell does that work out? How does that work out? But he's got the circles. He got like four, sometimes he has six because that's a good way of saying, if you don't have any people, just put them in the circle and he's practicing the science. Now it doesn't work out, but we're going to win four more years in the White House. We're doing things that nobody's ever done before. We're doing what nobody's ever done, and thank you for being here. I wish we could move the press back further, if you want to know the truth. As our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice … Thank you everybody. Thank you. So is our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I will soon announce a nominee for the United States Supreme Court. They say it's the most important thing a president can do. I don't know. I think military, maybe. We rebuilt your military two and a half trillion dollars. Great. We will fill that seat. It's going to go quickly. Probably announced the person. I don't want to make the men too angry. It will be a woman. Is that okay? I don't want to have a problem with men. They'll say Trump is doing very poorly with men. You listen. How's he doing? Well, he's doing very poorly with men, with women. He's doing very poorly with the black community, Hispanic community. Then you have the election night doing very poorly with those with diploma, without diploma, college, PhDs. What's he doing well? Oh no, it's going to be a very short night. Then they say Donald Trump is the projected winner by a lot. They say, well, what happened is he did very well with women did very well with men, diplomas. He did well with African American community. By the way, we are doing really well with the African American community, with the Hispanic community. We're doing well with women. We're doing very well. We're doing well with suburbia, suburbia. I ended a regulation that will destroy suburbia. If Biden got in, they will destroy the suburbia. We call it suburbia of the world and we love it. I know it well, Westchester County, the suburban, they sometimes, if you say suburban housewife, you're in deep trouble. So what you do is you say suburban women, they love me. You know why? They want security and they don't want projects being right next to their house. That's okay. They don't want it. By the way, that includes minorities. Because 29% to 30% of these suburban communities are minorities. That includes them. They don't want that. They want safe communities. They want great communities. They don't want to lose the American dream. It's very simple. I got rid of the regulation from Obama- Biden that was destroying suburbia. Okay? Destroying it. I think suburbia has got to wake up because if they get in, you know who's in charge? You know who's in charge of the program? Cory Booker, Cory Booker. Cory Booker. So, I think the suburban women and suburban men and husbands and wives and everybody, you better get smart because you're not going to have your dream very much longer if they get in. If I get in, you've got it. You've also got your second amendment if I get it. In 2018, we expanded the Senate majority. Remember, they said, first of all, I wasn't running. I wasn't running. It makes a difference. Wait you see what happens. We're going to take back the house. We're going to get rid of this crazy Nancy Pelosi. Kevin McCarthy's done a great job. We're going to take back the house. People are so tired of her. People are so tired. Did you hear today? The latest. So, they impeached me for perfect phone call. Perfect. It was a perfect phone call. Now they want to impeach me again if I nominate somebody as I'm constitutionally obligated to do, to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Go ahead and I want them to do that. I want them to do that. We will. We will. We will. If he puts forth a highly qualified candidate, we will impeach him. Well, I said, ""Well, I'm the only guy in the world that could get impeached for trying to fill a seat in the Supreme."" So, we're going to put up our nominee who's going to be outstanding. We're looking at five incredible jurists, five incredible people, women that are extraordinary in every way. I mean, honestly, it could be anyone. I mean, we're going to be announcing it on Friday or Saturday. Again, they say it's the most important thing and think of it. So in a single term, single term, by the end of our term, we will have nominated and had confirmed I think it'll end up being over 300 federal judges and hopefully three Supreme Court justices. Think of that. Three. Some presidents, they never get any. They last a long time, a lot of presidents get none. We've had three. It's blowing their minds. It's blowing their minds, but for the people of Ohio, this is what you want. So, it looks like we're going to have three and it's going to be very exciting. It's exciting even from me. I'm going to look forward to it. Probably Saturday, we will announce the nominee and it's somebody that you're going to have great respect for, great respect. Thank you. Big stuff. That's a big thing. They set the course of our country for many years to come, whether it's on life or the second amendment or so many other things, they set the whole course of the country. Very important position, the most important. Joe Biden has refused to list the names of his potential justices because he knows they're too extreme to withstand any form of public review. If Joe Biden and the Democrats take power, they will pack the Supreme Court with far left radicals who will unilaterally transform American society far beyond recognition. They will mutilate the largest figure the constitution and oppose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box. So, they don't want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far left radicals. If he does something even towards left of center, which would be acceptable, I guess, we have no choice. If he did that, he would lose the left. So, he's going to have to put in radicals. So he doesn't want to show who his judges are. I've shown a list, I have a double list, about 45 from which I will only pick, but he doesn't want to do that, because if you found out who he was going to pick, he would be unelectable. Hopefully, he's going to be unelectable anyway. We're going to find out. So, he wouldn't be able to survive a Joe Biden. You wouldn't be able to survive. We've been calling it socialism. I don't think it's socialism. I think it's a step beyond what they're talking about. You look at Portland, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, you look at Baltimore and Oakland. These are Democrat run cities that are horrible in crime. There's no law and order, no cash bail, no anything. You know what? The Republican cities are running great. They're running great. So, we're going to get it all changed around. We went into Minneapolis, we solved the problem like you wouldn't believe. What did it take? You saw it. What did that take? I would say probably 30 minutes. Right? They should have called us in about seven days earlier. How about the reporter? He gets up there, behind him is a burning city. I never saw anything like it. He's saying, ""There are really no protests here. This is very friendly."" We call this a friendly protester because you're not supposed to have political rallies. You're not supposed to have anything. The only thing you can have is thousands of people running down a street burning stores, looting, doing what … That's okay, because that's protesting, but we'll call this a friendly protest, but your children will be robbed of their future and the damage will endure for generations to come- … future the damage we'll endure for generations to come. We have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country in my opinion. And a lot of that's got to do with the fact that we're going to have one extra, but we didn't think this was going to happen. But I used to say just a week ago, ""We're going to have one, two, three, four, and maybe even five, the next President, and the Supreme Court is going to be a tremendous factor."" A lot of people said that's the reason I won so easily in the Electoral College last time. 306, 306 to 223. ""He will not get to 270."" Remember? ""He will not get to 270. This will be a short evening for Donald Trump. Oh, good riddance. Thank God we got rid of him. Oh, this is going to be great."" And then that problem happened. ""Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio."" Remember the one, she was crying? She was crying. ""Donald Trump has won Ohio."" But it wasn't winning Ohio, it was by the margin. ""Where the hell?"" he said, ""Where did this margin come from?"" They opened the polls. Then they closed the polls. Normally you have to wait hours, unless it's a total runaway. And they said, ""Ah, the polls and the doors are closed in Ohio. Donald Trump has won."" And they go, ""Oh my God. But wait a minute. He won by nine points. What the hell's going on over here?"" Then they said, ""Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the state of Georgia. Donald Trump has won North Carolina, South Carolina."" Remember that? Was that the most exciting evening, really? Remember? And it's not Donald Trump. It's you. It's all of us. They use the name Donald Trump. It's all of us have won. And this one's going to be even better because nobody has done, and then don't even challenge it, the fake news, nobody has done in three and a half years what we've done. We've rebuilt our military. Two and a half trillion dollars. We've taken care of our vets. We have choice, we have accountability. We can fire people now when they're not treating our vets right. We couldn't do that before. They could treat our vets terribly. We have accountability. Nobody has done what we've done for our vets. 91% approval rating at the VA. 91%, the highest ever. So nobody's done it, and that's why I think this is going to be the most important of all. I used to say, ""Well, I don't know. How does it compare to 2016?"" I just gave that up. This is the most important election. You know why? Two reasons. Number one, that's over with, the hell with it. The hell with it. But the truth is it's got a seat in, and we have a lot of new things including additional, substantial, middle income tax cuts and other tax cuts, and tremendous regulation cuts. And we're finishing up with our military. We're building Space Force. The wall is going incredibly. You remember the wall? They don't talk about the wall anymore, the fake news. Once we started building it, if you think that was easy to build the wall, we had an entire party that would die for the fact, and I made a terrible mistake in the wall, instead of telling you, ""We're going to build a wall, we're going to build a wall,"" the Democrats formed, it was very tough, but I got it. I'm a real estate developer. You can always get money. You learn we have a lot of little pockets. We had a lot of big pockets. But the military was great. The Army Corps of Engineers were great. So we're up to 330 miles of wall. We're doing 10 miles a week, and we're going to be finished with the wall very soon. And it's exactly the wall, the little more expensive wall, they want like nice, expensive, but exactly what border patrol wanted. We're building them the exact wall that they want. We can't give them any excuses. We can't give them any excuses. But it's true, they used to talk about the wall all the time because they never thought I'd be able to get a bill. Once I got it going, got it built, I got the financing, we won a lot of lawsuits, by the way, we won a lot of lawsuits. They sued us. Pelosi was suing us. Congress was suing us. The Senate was suing us. We won a lot of lawsuits. Once it was obvious that we won and we started building, they never talk about the wall anymore. And I made a terrible, terrible mistake because I had to work my ass off to get that thing built. You have no idea. You have no idea. You have no idea. But I should have said, the mistake, I should have said when I talked to these big crowds, and the crowds are getting bigger, there's more enthusiasm now than we ever had four years ago, but I should have said, instead of, ""We will build a wall,"" I kept, ""We will build a wall,"" place would go crazy, I should have said, ""We will not build the wall. Under no circumstances, will we build a wall,"" the Democrats would have given us all the money we wanted. It's true. It's true. And then they would have said, ""See, he didn't keep his campaign promise."" These people are sick. The Biden nominated justices will shred our Second Amendment, eliminate the right to self defense, and allow the government to confiscate your privately owned firearms. You know that. Put in other language, they will end your Second Amendment. And they will do that. By the way, if I wasn't here, you wouldn't have a Second Amendment right now. That would be gone. I hate to say it. I'm the only thing standing between you and chaos, I'm telling you. And Second Amendment and all of the other things. Biden's justices will remove the words ""under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance. Did you see that? Did you see it? They said, ""No, we'd never remove. And I saw it, they're doing the Pledge of Allegiance. And I said, ""Oh, it must be a typo."" They left the words ""under God"" out of the Pledge of Allegiance, the Democrats. And I said, ""Oh, there's a typo. Typo, they made a mistake. What a stupid mistake. Can you believe it? That guy's in big trouble. What a stupid mistake."" And then I heard it a second time. They did the same mistake. That's what they're doing. They're going to take God out of everything just like they want to knock down the statue of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. That's never happening. It's never happening. A lot of these Democrats states, you see it, the churches are closed. They don't want our churches to open. You can have a riot where you kill people in the streets. 25,000 people don't have to wear a mask, nothing. They can march down the streets, step on each other's face, they can do whatever the hell they want, that's okay. But you can't go to church. They have ideas, they have plans, and it's never happening with me as your President. That I can tell you. And you see it, they want to tear down crosses from public spaces. You see it. Since I signed a little law, they were ripping down a lot of statues about four months ago, and I said, ""Do we have any laws, like old laws when they was strong, when we were smart, when we were tough?"" ""Sir, we have one, sir."" A General came in. ""What's the law, General?"" ""Sir, there was a law from quite a while ago, 10 years in prison."" They didn't use the word jail, prison. Prison's a tougher word. I said, ""What do you mean, 10 years?"" ""You get 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue or if you knock down a monument."" I said, ""General, let me see that sucker, please. Bring that to my office."" And we revived it because you can't get that approved by Congress. They would never. Today in Congress, you'd do it, they'll give you half a day in a hotel someplace. So 10 years. So they were having a big march on Washington in two days and I signed this new law. We updated it, and it was 10 years. You get 10 years in prison. You touch, you knock down a monument. And there's no games. This is the old days. This is the days when we had strong laws, when we had real laws, when we had real politicians that knew how to make laws. So here's the thing. So they weren't going to come in, they were actually looking to knock down the statue of a man named Thomas Jefferson. That's not too good. They had obliterated a lot of different things. And so I had a news conference. I announced that I'm signing a law that anybody that knocks down a monument or a statue gets 10 years in jail. And the police in Washington, and we had National Guard, we had Secret Service. We were all ready for them. We were ready for them. And the time came, there's was only a problem, nobody showed up. You know why? 10 years was too much. 10 years was too much. It's amazing the way. Isn't it amazing the way it all works? So instead they burned down Portland. I speak to the Governor. The mayor is hopeless. He's a hopeless, poor guy. They chased him out of his apartment, and he still thinks they're wonderful people. They're burning down his city. But I want to go in there with the National Guard so bad. It would take us 15 minutes to solve the problem. When they heard in Seattle that we were going in, we were going in the next day, the guys just walked away. They left. That was the end of it. We had nothing to do. But they want to ban all prayer in public schools and require taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion. Biden's justices will erase national borders, they don't want borders, protect sanctuary cities, and compel the unlimited entry of foreign nationals. And if you look at some of these jihadist nations, no thank you. Somebody said, ""That's not nice. That's not politically correct."" I said, ""That's okay."" They'll clip all the police departments, free violent criminals, shield foreign terrorists, and declare the death penalty unconstitutional, even for the most depraved mass murderers who kill women and children. That's what they want. They don't want any death penalty. Not for the Boston Bomber, not for anybody. You see the Boston Bomber, they're still trying this guy, what he did to so many lives. He killed people, ruined so many families, ruined so many lives. And by the way, they want the Boston Bomber to be able to vote. You know that. In three and a half years under my administration, we've secured America's borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and brought jobs and factories back to the great state of Ohio. I love Ohio. I love Ohio. I don't know what it is. I was told by Bob and some of the Congressmen that are here, we have some great ones, I'm going to introduce them in a second, but I was told that they're not even trying for Ohio. You know why? Because I love you and you love me, and that's the way it is. That's the way it is. Thank you. I love you too. It's very interesting. So somebody in the fake news media did a story yesterday because there's crazy chances going on. They have too about the seat and all that. But there was another chant that's happening at all these rallies. We're having massive rallies. We're in Minnesota. We had a tremendous crowd. Wisconsin, tremendous. Pennsylvania, every one of them. I mean, in all fairness, it's like this, everyone. But this rant is going on like it's crazy. And it's, ""We love you. We love you. We love you,"" and you know what? I don't want to say it. I'm just saying, they have not been able to find in the history of politics in this nation, even we loved Ronald Reagan, but they have not been able to find where people broke out and said, ""We love you,"" about, I guess I have to call myself a politician. I don't feel like a politician. How nice is that? I never heard it. I've been to a lot of different speeches and rallies. I've never heard crowds go, ""We love you."" But you know why? We love you. I love you. But you know why? Because, again, nobody has done what we've done. Ohio had the best year in its history last year. We had a great year. And next year, assuming we win, which I hope we're going to win, but if we win, you're going to have a year next year. First of all, take a look at the third quarter. It's going to be announced the numbers just before the election. They'll come out three days before the election. And I'll tell you what, I'll bet on the numbers, even though Crazy Nancy and these people don't want to give any stimulus, they don't want to give anything. They want to keep a lot of states closed wherever they can. You know what they're going to do? They're going to announce they're going to be opening on November 4th. There'll be open. All these closed states, they're going to be open on November 4th. One of them blue and a teacher's union. Did you see it? ""No, we don't want to open now. We don't want to open. The pandemic. We don't want to."" We're rounding the turn on the pandemic. Vaccines are coming soon. ""But we don't want to open. Around November 4th we're going to open."" This person that's a judge of a union said that. That was not good. I think they'll get rid of her quickly. I'm also proud that we have successfully brought back the Big 10 and the Ohio State Buckeyes. You better have a good year after all of that. You have a good team, right? Good coach. Good team. Good everything. You have a good team. You always have a good team. But there was a case, what do I know? I said, ""How's it going? Everything good? Are you struggling?"" They said, ""Sir, Sleepy Joe Biden did an ad that you,"" me, ""that you closed football."" I said, ""What do you mean I closed? I didn't close."" The guy did an ad. It's called disinformation. It's called the opposite of what the fact is. Not only didn't I close it, I didn't think about it too much, okay? The states should all be open. But I heard about Big 10 football, and because of this ad, I said, ""Hey, wait a minute. I have an idea."" It was a fake ad, just like the ad on the grave sites, and that allows me to say that this man is a gross incompetent. He has no idea. Because now, see, I would never talk like that, but when I saw that horrible thing, and nobody's done more for the military than I have, when I saw that horrible ad, ""An anonymous source has said that Donald Trump said this,"" I have 28 people now that have come forward saying it's a total lie, they don't care, so they did an ad, once they did that, I said, ""Well, now the gloves are off."" Let's face it, Joe Biden is incompetent. He always was even in prime time. he was incompetent in prime time. And now he's really incompetent. But because of the ad, I said, ""It's very interesting, that ad, it's very interesting. Let me call up the Commissioner."" I had called up the Commissioner, very good guy, and I said, ""Commissioner, what can we do to get Big 10 football back?"" ""Well, I don't know."" And we started a little thing, the Commissioner and myself, one of my guys, he's fantastic, and within a few days, it started getting talked about, and then we kept it going and we helped him with some testing because we have the greatest testing in the world. We get no credit for it. We've tested almost 100 million people. India is second with 38th and they have 1.5 billion people, slightly more than you. But I will tell you, so all of a sudden they have schools. Then looked like it was going to open without Michigan and without a couple of states. And then all of a sudden the pressure became so great, and the full league is opening now and it's going to be very exciting. And I will tell you, it's not a question of taking credit, but truly we were the ones that did that. I mean, it was. I'll tell you when I do it and when I don't. But it was closed, it was gone, it was announced that it was closed. And what really spurred me on was when Sleepy Joe announced that I was the one that did it. I said, ""I didn't even know it was closed."" But once I found out it was, I called the Commissioner. He was really good, I tell you. And we called a couple of the top people at the universities and they got it going. It looked like we had seven schools, eight schools. All of a sudden, everybody fell into line. I think they're all open now. Every one of them is participating. So I want to thank the Commissioner. I want to thank all of those schools. May the best team win. In other words, Ohio State. That's a good team. You know who the best proponents were? The players and especially the parents of the players. These kids have a short window to get into the NFL to create some excitement and how good they are. And you have a lot of potential players, but they couldn't play football. And they said, ""We're safer on the field than we are staying at home,"" and they meant it. And we did something and I'm happy about it. So enjoy the football, enjoy it. Under 16 years of Presidents Obama and Bush, median household income rose only $2,945. So remember that. That's 16 years, 2009, so let's say 3000. Under three years of President Trump, it rose almost $7,000. So think of that, 16 years. Three years, achieving the highest median income in the history of our country. In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any President in the history of our country. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world and we are doing it again. We're building it again. I see the signs ""Make America Great Again,"" so I say this, it's called now ""Make America Great Again. Again"". Because we did it and then we had to close it up. We saved millions of lives. If we didn't do that, you would have had three million people. It would have been terrible. It's terrible anyway. They shouldn't have allowed it to happen, China. To defeat the China Virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War Two. Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate- Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that. That's remdesivir and all of the things, the plasma, all different things. Where do you see what's coming out? Europe is almost 30% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. That's before today's big breakout. You know they had a big breakout in Europe and they keep saying in the fake news, they keep saying about, ""Oh, Europe, Europe, Europe."" Well, we're doing better than Europe. I hate to see what happened, and it had a big impact on the market today because it was a bad thing. But they had a big hit and they'll take care of it. They know how to do it. They'll take care of it. We're working very closely with Europe and other countries, including on the vaccine. We have three vaccines right now that are right there. They're right at the starting gate and they're going to be fantastic. So it's good. With Biden, if you had that regime, you'd be three years away because it would have never gotten out of the FDA. What we've done in a very safe manner is amazing. Now remember this, Biden was in charge of the swine flu, right? It's called the H1N1. Remember he calls it the N1H1. I said, ""No, no, no, no."" H comes before the N. It's so easy. But he goes, ""The N1H1."" We say, ""No."" But it's the swine flu. Maybe we just call it the swine flu. He did such a gross, horrible job on that. His own man who was in charge of it said they didn't have a clue. They didn't know what they were doing. It was a much less lethal disease and they lost many, many people. Many, many people. It was totally incompetently. And now I got this guy standing up. Well, we're giving him advice. His own guy that ran it. Did everybody see this? They're saying they didn't have a clue what they were doing. It was so bad. I don't know why the hell he said it, to be honest with you. Who would say that? Maybe because he was honest. Does that make sense? Now Biden gets up and he's saying to do the same things as we've already done. He basically took our plan and he said, ""This is what you should do."" But we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world and the fastest economic recovery by far of any Western nation by far. Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1.9 million jobs in the state of Ohio. You know that? He knows it. He's got one of them. He's got one of them. Through operation warp speed, we're developing these great vaccines. And that's going to be… Literally, these will be done in record time. Like nobody's ever done it before. On November 3rd, Ohio will decide whether we end the pandemic and return to record prosperity or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden and his group of incompetence to delay the vaccine, shut down the country. He actually suggested that he would shut down the country. We now know the disease. We didn't know it. Now we know it affects elderly people with heart problems and other problems. If they have other problems, that's what it really affects. That's it. You know, in some States, thousands of people, nobody young below the age of 18, like nobody. They have a strong immune system. Who knows? Take your hat off to the young because they have a hell of an immune system, but it affects virtually nobody. It's an amazing thing. By the way, open your schools. Everybody open your schools. Sleepy Joe Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax site, ban American energy, destroy the suburbs, give free healthcare to illegal aliens. How about that one? You know the bad part about that? We all have heart. We want to take care of people. Probably that is everybody's going to come to the United States. People that weren't even thinking about it, they're going to say, ""Oh man, these idiots are giving free healthcare, free college education. They're giving free everything. They're giving a Rolls Royce to every family that enters through the Southern border."" Remember I said that jokingly and CNN said, ""He misrepresented. They are not getting a Rolls Royce."" I agree. Now they're sick. They are sick. And indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies. They're doing that. We're stopping it. To combat the toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we're launching a pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and we are getting better and better all the time. We got to. No party can lead America that will not teach our children to love America. Biden's running mate, Kamilla. Who likes Kamilla? Does anybody like her? She was the most failed candidate. I mean, she started off good. And every week she went down, down 15 points, 12 points, 11 points, 9 points, six points, five points, four points, two points. Didn't she leave at about two or one? She was heading down to the basement. She was so mean to him. I felt sorry for him. No, I did. I felt sorry. So she called them everything from a racist to a MeTooer. He was MeToo. He was a part of the MeToo generation. What she called him, what she said. So I brilliantly said, ""Well, he can't pick Pocahontas because she was too nasty. How nasty was she to Bloomberg? Was she unbelievable? Boy, he was standing there. What happened? What happened? No, actually. What happened? Mini Mike. He's another beauty. He's a real beauty. Mini Mike, what happened? What the hell happened? He hit her so hard. Remember? She hits him with about 30 different things, and I'm not talking about our president. He thought she was talking about me. Can you believe it? And I'm not talking. I'm talking about you. He said, ""Get me out of here. Get me out of here."" And now he wants to buy his way back into the Democrat party. He wants to buy his way back into the Democrats. He hasn't taken enough abuse. If I were him, I'd sort of either ride it out or stay with the good Trump economy and get even richer. Biden's running made even urged supporters to help the bail riders out of jail. You saw that? Including one who attempted to murder a police officer and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight year old child. Now they're trying to free them on bail. They're putting up the money to get them out by this plan to appease the domestic terrorist. And that's what it is. My plan is to arrest the domestic terrorist, and that's what we're doing for many people in jail. Many people. Remember what I told you about the monuments? This is remembrance. Isn't it beautiful? We don't see that anymore. Have you seen a monument knocked down recently? No, we don't see it anymore. I don't know. We want to rip down Abraham Lincoln. It got to Lincoln. First, it was not too many people heard of him. Confederate soldiers, et cetera. You say, ""Hey, look, do it through a process."" But they started hitting Lincoln. Then they hit Gandhi. Now Gandhi was about peace. Gandhi just wanted peace. Leave me alone. Peace, peace, peace. Let's rip them down. They're sick people. The Democrat party's war on cops has already led to a surge in vicious murders in Democrat control cities costing countless black lives. If Biden and the left gain power, they will dismantle police departments nationwide. I'll tell you, the community that's most hurt, most hurt by what they're doing and there is the black community, the Hispanic community. And we're doing great in the polls with the black community and the Hispanic community. And the Asian community. We're doing great. In fact, we did so well last night on one poll, they said it must be a typo. They did. It must be an error. It wasn't. It's no error. You're going to find out on November 3rd it's no error. As president, I always stand and I will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. They're great people. They're very brave people. Not easy, and they don't get support. We have to give them back their dignity. We have to let them do their job. That's very simple. They're great. We're joined tonight by two high school football players. They became very, very famous. They became more famous than President Trump. They were beautiful. I watched them running through the crowds with those flags. Here's some place, I don't know, you got a lot of people here. We're going to try and figure it out. Hold up your flag. Jared Bentley and Brady Williams, who were recently suspended from their high school football team after displaying flags in support of our police and first responders on the anniversary of September 11th attacks. Where are they? Come up here, fellas. Come up. Come up here. Come up here. Secret Service is thrilled about this. See, these young kids can hop over the fence like it's nothing. Come up here. They're good looking kids. I want to congratulate you. You become famous. They're going to go to Hollywood. They're going to become movie actors right now. Right? You feel good about it? How's your team doing? How's your team? How's it doing? He said it could be better. You know what? You're doing great. And everybody out here loves you and they appreciate you. You did a great job. Good job, fella. Good job. Good luck. Is your arm okay? Good. You all right? Good. Good guys. Good guys. Jared and Brady, thank you for supporting the heroes in our law enforcement. We all love you. I'm telling you. You really set something up that's incredible, and thank your parents for letting you do it. I watched. You ask your parents approval. Isn't that nice? You know what the father said? ""You better do it."" Right? That's great. Thank you very much, fellas. Great job. Really great job. Country has a lot of respect. Speaking about warriors, we're also joined tonight by some great, great congressmen who are warriors and they represent Ohio so well and they love you and they love our country. Representative Bob Latta. Thank you, Bob. Great job. They like you, Bob. That's very good. Good job, Bob. Thank you very much. Congressman Warren Davidson. You know Warren. Thank you, Warren. Great job, Warren. Congressman Mike Turner. A great lawyer, actually. Thank you, Mike. Great job, Mike. You're really great. Ohio treasurer Robert Sprague. Robert, thank you. Thanks. Good treasurer. Ohio auditor Keith Faber. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, Keith. Ohio House speaker, Bob Cupp. Where is he? Thank you, Bob. Great job. Ohio Senate president, Larry Obhof. Thank you. Thank you, Larry Obhof. Larry is a good man. How's it going, Larry? Good. You're doing a good job. Huh? You're doing good. How are we doing, Larry? Is it going good? You're right about that. You're doing a great job. Thanks, Larry. I appreciate it. Ohio GOP chairman Jane Timken. She's unbelievable. Thank you, Jane. How are we doing, Jane? How's it going? How does it compare to four years ago, Jane? Up higher. All right. Good. Good. I think we are. I think we are. A friend of mine that I'll tell you, this is the greatest optimist. When I thought we had to be down, we lost a lot of the top, top support. The head of the Republican party, little things like that. I said, ""We don't have a head of the Republican party. He left because you had a terrible governor in this state."" Terrible. Your previous governor was terrible. He was terrible. I'll tell you, I got this man. I didn't know him. Within about a week, I said, ""Man, this guy's a big optimist."" And he was right. He called it right to the thing. He ran my campaign. When he came back for the second time, we had him in a high position. I said, ""Bob, I think you're great. You're doing a great job. I want you back in Ohio. We have to do it again."" Bob Paduchik. Where's Bob? Thank you. Thank you, Bob. Get over here, Bob. Thank you, Bob. He wants no glamor. He wants no glory. He just wants to win. He called it right down to the bone. We had a rough couple of days. I said, ""Bob, how we doing?"" ""You went up two points."" I said, ""You got to be kidding."" But we did. So much evolves around Ohio and it's just a state that we have a relationship with. It's a great state. We've done a great job for you and you've done a great job for us. So we appreciate it very much. Thank you. Together, we've spent the last four years reversing the damage done by the Democrats and Joe Biden over a 47 year period. Think of it. He's always talking about, ""You should have done this. You should have done that."" He really just left office. It's not that long ago, right? He's been there for years and years and now he should have done. He's never going to do anything. He's never going to do anything. Guy is a stone cold loser. Biden supported every globalist sellout of Ohio workers for over a half a century, including NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the disaster known as TPP and how about the Paris Climate Accord? That's another beauty. I'll tell you, that was designed to hurt our country. You would have lost trillions of dollars, closed your factories all over the place. In the meantime, China didn't kick in for another 10 years. The whole thing was a rigged deal. I tell you, I said, ""I'm going to get killed for this one, but we're going to terminate."" And you know what? The people got it right away. Everybody understood. That was another rip off of our country. This state lost one in three manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters. Joe Biden is a shameless phony who pretends… He doesn't have a clue. What the hell? We're talking like he knows. He's got guys around him that are pretty smart. They're radical left. He's going to do whatever they tell him to do. He pretends to care about blue collar workers. After spending more than five decades in Washington, he tells me, ""Why didn't you do this? Why didn't you do that?"" You see these fake commercials. ""Why didn't you do it?"" I said, ""I've only been here three and a half years. This guy has been here for 47 years. He didn't do anything."" My actions saved countless jobs across Ohio and here in Toledo, the home of the Jeep, right? The home of the Jeep. That's good. That's a great brand. They've done a great job with Jeep. Jeep. Everyone loves Jeep. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to Ohio when we ended the NAFTA nightmare. I proudly signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement in July. That's a big difference. Like day and night. It's working out great too. It's working out great. You know how I know that it's a good deal for us? Because they don't like it. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of Ohio jobs. We achieved American energy. We passed record tax cuts and regulations. Our energy independence is incredible. We have now energy independence. We don't have to be in these far away lands anymore. Now we'll be there to help certain allies that have been great, but we don't have to be. Since my election, natural gas production in Ohio has surged 63%. They want to close it up. By the way, you do know they want to close it up. They want to close up all fracking natural gas ever. They want to close it up. This would kill at least 700,000 Ohio jobs. Probably more than a million. While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas and Ohio workers will continue leading the way. I just left the great state of Texas, and I talked to a lot of people like this, a great crowd of people. We have tremendous support all over the country. I'll tell you what. These people are great. And here's the platform that they have. Sleepy Joe Biden. No oil, no religion, no God, and no guns. Now I'm in Texas. It's a really rough thing in Ohio, but now we're talking Texas. No oil, that doesn't work well in Texas, right? No guns. That doesn't work well in Texas. No God. Look what they're doing to the churches and everything. That doesn't work. No God. No religion. That doesn't work well. You would have to be George Washington with your running mate would be Abraham Lincoln. Okay. Your VP candidate. And you'd still lose very big. And then they say- … and you'd still lose very big. And then they say, ""Yeah, he's doing okay. He's two up in Texas."" They said it last time too, that Texas is even, four years ago. And everybody said, ""No, I think Trump is killing it."" We'd have stadiums with 25,000, 30,000 people, much more that couldn't get in. We'd have 40,000, 50,000 people outside and they'd say I was even. We won in a landslide, just like we won this state, in a landslide. You know the expression they use, ""Texas is in play."" You know what ""in play"" means? It could go either way. And guys would get on there and say, ""I don't think so."" And then that night again, ""The polls in Texas have closed. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas."" I mean, the whole thing is crazy. It's crazy, it's crazy. You know what they do? It's suppression polls. They try and depress you. They try and make you unhappy so you go out to dinner with your wife, your husband, you go out to dinner, ""Darling, let's have dinner. It's so sad. We love Donald, but he just can't make it. He can't make it. Let's go out, have dinner. We'll come home and watch the results."" Except 2016 came and nobody did that, they all went out and voted and we kicked ass. Tell me, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? Did you ever see the ratings, the combined ratings? I think the biggest ever. But was that the most exciting? 2016, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military, including more than $6 billion in contracts. I'll tell you what, you like the word pronounced Lima or Lima, because I saved Lima. And I tell you what, I saved Lima. I came here and they were going to close that plant in Lima. They were going to close the tank plant. It was done. And I said, ""Why are we closing a tank plant?"" And I got a couple of calls from my friends, the Congressman right here. And I got calls. And Jim Jordan called me. Do you like Jim Jordan? He's great. And I looked at this army tank plant in Lima. I said, ""Why are we closing it?"" And I saw the people building the tanks and the technology's incredible. And if you ever closed it, you'd never be able to open a thing like that again. So I overrode the generals, I overrode everybody, and now we're making a record number of tanks in that plant and it's absolutely thriving. But we had tremendous success. We took 100% of the ISIS caliphate and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. We took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many other people. Qasem Soleimani is dead. He's dead. I withdrew from last administration's disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. They paid $150 billion, plus $1.8 billion in cash. You know they got? Nothing. They got nothing. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Every president for many, many decades said they were going to do it. They never did it. They never did it. They didn't have the guts to do it. They campaigned on it, they were all going to do it. Then they got there, there was a lot of pressure put on them. A lot of pressure put on me. Every leader was calling all over. ""Please don't do it. Please don't do it. Mr. President, please don't do it. Don't do it. Don't move it. Just leave it the way it is. It's okay."" But I promised and I said, ""I'm going to do it."" And then I got calls from the biggest people in the world. Kings, I got calls from presidents, from prime ministers, ""Please, please don't tell it."" Then I got calls, ""Please have him call me back me,"" me. I said, ""Look, tell everybody I'm out for three days. I'm not going to be able to call them back."" I had a news conference, we announced it. Then I called everybody back. ""Hey, how you doing? How's everything going? Everything going good?"" ""Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel, but it's too late. You already did it."" And we did it and we got it done and nobody else got it done. And it's something we had to do. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And instead of endless wars, we are forging peace all over the Middle East. And you saw that. And I'm the only man that got nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and I didn't get any press. They wouldn't. For two of them. Last week, I'm not bragging about it, I'm just saying, I'm the President of the United States because of Kosovo-Serbia, they've been killing each other for years, I worked out a deal for them. I got nominated. And then Israel with Bahrain and UAE, and many more to come. I mean, they all want to do it. We'll have peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand. No blood. We're going to have peace in the Middle East. So I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. And I told this story last night. Should I tell it or not? Should I? Yes. She wants me to do it. So I go home to our great First Lady. I said, ""First Lady, you're going to be so proud of me tonight. I was nominated not once but twice for totally separate events by different people."" Great people. ""First lady, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize."" I was like this. ""I was nominated."" It's a big deal for our country, right? And she said, ""Oh, that's good."" I said, ""Let's turn on the evening news. Let's watch it. This is going to be a big show tonight. Get ready."" And NBC, which is one of the most crooked, one of the worst newscasts, and I'm talking about normal NBC, not MSDNC. MSDNC is the worst. So I turned on NBC with Lester Holt, another beauty. And they start with a hurricane and then they went to something, and something else. And I'm saying, ""First Lady, this is getting a little embarrassing. We're 20 minutes into a half hour show. They haven't mentioned the Nobel Peace Prize."" And then it went through the whole show and they never mentioned. Then I got nominated for a second one. They never mentioned. And when Barack Obama, Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, now when Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, he didn't know why he was nominated. It was like right at the very beginning. He didn't do anything. He did nothing and he got nominated. It was the biggest story I've ever seen. But that's okay. In the meantime, we're President and they're not. No, that's right. You would think if you nominated for the Nobel Prize, you'd get maybe half a second. The First Lady, she said, ""Sorry, darling. That's the way it goes, isn't it?"" Joe Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He voted for the Iraq War disaster. He backed the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. And he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for our country. ""Oh, it's really great."" If it were up to Sleepy Joe, bin Laden and Soleimani would be alive today, ISIS would be on a rampage, Iran would control the Middle East, and China would be the dominant power anywhere in the world. And I want to tell you, if you go back a few months before this pandemic, we were gaining, gaining, gaining. We had an insurmountable lead on China. I always heard they were going to catch us by 2019 for 10 years. We were so far beyond, we were doing much better than they were. The Biden agenda would obliterate our economy. He destroyed social security, destroyed protections for pre-existing conditions. That's what he's going to do, drain your Medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants. He would end our travel ban to jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by, listen to this, over 700%. And this is the manifesto with Bernie Sanders, with Crazy Bernie. He made this deal with Crazy Bernie. And by the way, a lot of the Crazy Bernie voters last time, four years ago, voted for Trump because of trade, because the one thing they do understand, that our country has been off for years. Biden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools. Very important to have them. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. They're totally against it. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just, in conclusion, first of all, it's been a great honor to be with you. This is, really, it's a great state. They're great people. I really mean it. No, I really mean it. Get out there on November 3rd. We've got to win this one big. This is a bad, bad ideology. This is probably a step beyond socialism. I really think in many ways, it's communism we're talking about. This is a step beyond. Socialism's no good. Communism's really bad. But get out there on November 3rd and let's show him your stuff and show them the stuff of all of us. So, in concluding, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end the reliance, this ridiculous, crazy reliance on China, and all of these far away lands once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police. And by the way, thank you, police. Thank you, law enforcement. Increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, stupid, endless, foreign wars. We will maintain America's unrivaled military. Our military might has never been like it is right now because of what we've done. And we had no choice, and hope to God we never have to use it, because if you would ever see the power of what we've done over the last three years, it's almost better for you not to see it. We are the envy of every power, every country in the world. We have weapons that nobody ever even thought possible. And just as I said, hope to God we never have to use them. And the way we don't have to use them is to keep that kind of strength. Nobody's going to be talking to us. We're going to have peace through strength, and it's all made in the U.S.A. Made in the U.S.A. We'll end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. I've already signed it into law. Kicks in on January 1st. It's going to cut your bills down to a level that you wouldn't believe. That doesn't mean the drug companies and the hospital and corporations are happy with me. But that's okay. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs by 50%, 60% and 70%. Big pharma does not like me too much. They're taking ads about me that are so bad, but you get it, you understand it. They're not too thrilled with me, including the rebates. The rebates go back to you. The rebates before went back to very rich people. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That's what's happening. NASA is again the leading space station anywhere in the world. There's nothing like a space center, what we've done. And there was grass growing in the runways when I took over three and a half years ago. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ""In God we trust."" For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great state of Ohio. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get everybody, and get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. And in your state, in Ohio, early voting has already begun and don't wait. And when you see them cheating on the other side, I don't say if, when, when you see them cheating with those ballots, all of those unsolicited ballots, those millions of ballots, you'll see them, anytime you do, report them to the authorities. The authorities awaiting and watching. From Akron to Columbus, from Cincinnati to Queen City, I know it weller than Cleveland, and from Dayton to Toledo, we inherit the legacy of generations of Ohio patriots, like Neil Armstrong, Annie Oakley, William McKinley, and the amazing Ulysses S. Grant, that's good. Nobody's stock has gone up like Grant. Nobody in the last 10 years. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and you haven't seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Ohio, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.

"We brought you a lot of car plants, Michigan. We brought you a lot of car plants. You know that, right? Long time, it's been a long time since you had all these plants being built, but we brought you a lot over the last three and a half years, and we're going to bring you a lot more. That's happening. Hello, Michigan and I'm thrilled to be in Freeland with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. Fifty-four days from now, we're going to win Michigan, and we're going to win four more years in the White House. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring Michigan's jobs, outsourcing- We shouldn't be smiling about it, but we've changed it around. Outsourcing Michigan's factories, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars and surrendering our children's future to China and other far away lands. Biden supported every disastrous globalist sellout for over a half a century, including NAFTA, China, and DPP. You know that. Joe Biden surrendered your jobs to China and now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob and you're seeing that every night. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchist, arsonist and flag burners win. But I wouldn't worry about it because he's not winning. I don't think he's winning. This is not the crowd of a person who comes in second place. You do know that. The same thing happened four years ago. It was election eve but by the time I got here, it was late. Some of you are in that audience at one o'clock in the morning now election day. We had 32,000 people show up and the reason I went is that I heard that crooked Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama were traveling to Michigan because they heard they had problems. They were supposed to win Michigan, but they did such a lousy job that they had to come and get some votes. They came and I heard about it. They said, ""Sir, could you do it?"" I hopped in the plane. We landed at 12 o'clock in the evening. I started speaking at one o'clock in the morning now election day. 32,000 people. She had 500 people. I said, ""Why are we going to lose Michigan?"" And we didn't. And we didn't. First time in a long time, but now we're up in the polls. We just saw polls. We're up in Michigan. I don't know if that's good or bad. I don't know. I don't know if that's good or bad because in all those polls where we were down last time, we won. So maybe we're better off being down a little bit. Hello, John James. I see you handsome guy. John James, get out and vote for John. I'm going to introduce you in a second John James. What a job you've done. I have to tell you, he took, I saw this group of people that were running, all nice people, three very rich people and one guy that was John James and I saw them all. Right? I saw them all and I said, ""Wait."" With the wonderful invention of TiVo, one of the greats, you can play it back. I said, ""Who was that?"" He said, ""I don't know, sir."" I said, ""Play it back."" I said, ""That man is going to be a star."" It was John James. That was in the Republican primary. After learning about him with his incredible career and helicopter, and he's a great, and actually a great flyer I heard the other day, a great one, a really good one as opposed to those that aren't so good, but his incredible background and education at West Point and all of the things he did. I said, ""This guy"" and I endorsed him and he went like a rocket ship. Frankly, if he had a little more support, he would have won the last time. This time, I hear you're even, and maybe even ahead, and we're going to win with John James. He's a great guy, but I'm going to introduce him in a second. I'm running for reelection to keep jobs in Michigan. We have got a lot of … Last year before the China plague came in, we have the China plague. Thank you China very much. Should have never let that happen. They should have never, ever let it happen. They stopped it from going into China, but they didn't stop it from coming out here and coming into the US, in Europe and the rest of the world, 188 countries. But it is what it is and we're not happy about it and we're going to remember it. We're going to remember it, but we had in Michigan and in the country, the greatest economy in the history of the world, there has never been an economy. Now, we're building it again and it's being built fast. By the way, it's turning out to be John, a super V. No more V. Now it's starting out to be a super V, but to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, because if we win, America wins and that's what it's about. If we win, America wins. Not only does Joe Biden want to eliminate your jobs, he wants to eliminate your borders. He's promised to flood your state with refugees. You know that as well as I do. You see it all the time. From terrorist hotspots around the world, including Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, Biden's pledged to have a 700% increase. He made this deal with crazy Bernie, a 700% increase in the flow of refugees. So, he wants to lift it up by 700%. This is in their manifesto. He's also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans, overwhelming your state with poorly vetted migrants from jihadist regions. Making matters worse, he would open the flood gates in the middle of a pandemic. By the way, the wall, it's over 311 miles long right now doing very well. Doing very well. Make the mic louder, the mic louder. Biden is waging war against the American middle class. I think most of you are not middle class. You're upper class. You're the elite. You know the way they talk about the elite, the elite, they're really elite. I see them. They're not elite. You're the elite. The elite has decided. Boy, have we hurt the elite, haven't we now? You're the super elite. The left wants to get rid of me so they can come after you. It's very simple. Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, blocked the entry of foreign terrorist, fixed our disastrous trade deals and we have fixed our trade deals good. They are good. In fact, Biden was interviewed today on … There they are. CNN. No, he was just interviewed today. He was interviewed by Jake Tapper who I find to be a nice guy. I don't think he likes me too much, but that's okay. He was interviewed on CNN and they said, ""Which is better, NAFTA or the USMCA?"" He said, ""No, no, the USMCA."" Tapper goes, ""What?"" Couldn't believe it. He said USMCA. He made a mistake. From his perspective, he made a mistake because he doesn't know what's going on. Even though he's right, he doesn't know. There were a little surprised to hear that. They gave him a few chances. Let's ask that question again, but we brought back our manufacturing jobs. We rebuilt the awesome power of the US military. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. Now, we are doing it again bigger and better than ever before. Before the end of the year, we will have a safe and effective vaccine and we will defeat the China virus. I have a feeling … By the way, I think the vaccine is going to come very soon, going to come very soon. With it or without it, we're rounding the turn. You see what's happening. You see the numbers are plunging. You see how good we're doing relative to other countries and other parts of the world, but the fake news doesn't like saying that. They don't like telling you that. Next year, unless you have somebody that's going to quadruple your taxes, raise your taxes, raise up all of those regulations that we cut, next year will be one of the greatest years of the history of our country. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, and two agendas for the future. There's never been a vision like this. You have sleepy Joe and you have Trump. Sleepy Joe, he's a beauty. He's a beauty. He's a beauty. I watched the Democrat debates, right? I watched them up there and he was so bad. I said, ""There's no way he makes it."" It's sad, isn't it? The first lady actually came in and one time she watched it and she goes, and she's a nice person. She meant this really, me, I view it differently. But she looked at, she watched the debate and she watched Joe and she said, ""Darling, it's so sad."" This was early on. This is the guy I'm running against. It's so sad. Darling, it's so sad. But we got them. Joe Biden has put forward the most extreme platform and it's not him. He doesn't know what platform. He doesn't. It's your radical left people. It's AOC plus three. It's all these people. Bernie. It's Bernie. It's Kamala, the most liberal person in the US Senate. I tell it all the time. She started off her poll numbers at 15, 14, 12, 12. Then she went back up to 12 and a half. Then there was a big plunge right down to the bottom and then she dropped out. She dropped out, but there's never been anything like this. No major party has ever had a candidate that's so extreme in his views. Again, he took the manifesto drawn up by Bernie and the super lips and that's what he's going by, including a massive increase in your taxes and a total assault on your second amendment. On November 3rd, Michigan, you better vote for me. I got you so many damn car plants. I'll tell you what, I'll be so angry at you. I got you a lot of plants. Is that right? I mean, have you seen how we're doing here? All the plants that have been built, are being built and what about the plants that are being expanded? They don't want to give you credit for that. They just expanded. I went to Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I say, ""Prime Minister, you have to start doing something."" He's a great guy. He'll be retiring soon. He's a great guy, the prime minister of Japan, Abe. I say, ""Shinzō, Shinzō, you have to do me a favor. You've got to send car plants over here. You're sending all those cars. We stupidly don't. Now they've been building it for a number of years, but you hadn't had a plan built in like 42 years. They were the old plants. And it's been amazing what's happened in Michigan. But honestly, it's been amazing what's happened in Ohio and North Carolina and South Carolina and Florida and New Hampshire and so many other places. Our country is doing great. We had to take a pause to get rid of the China virus, and we got rid … We're coming around. We're coming around that turn. I'm telling you, you watch, next year, better than last year. It's going to be better than last year. Michigan will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, or whether we'll allow Sleepy Joe to impose $4 trillion in tax hikes, ban American energy, confiscate your guns, shut down the economy, and tell your governor to open up your state. It's all Democrat governors. And I think they do it for political reasons because there'll be less activity. You'd be doing even better if you had a governor that knew what the hell she was doing. You got to open it up the state. And also, you have to have a governor because right now Michigan's lagging. Great football, great coach, great team. We want a governor, John James, that's going to let Michigan play Big Ten football this year. You've been seeing a lot of the other schools want to open Big Ten at my suggestion. How about Sleepy Joe? He said, ""Donald Trump is against football."" No, no, no. I'm the one that says open it up, let's play football. These people practice disinformation like nobody has ever practiced it. They're liars. I'll tell you, they lie. But we have a good chance. You have a very good commissioner, and the commissioner is working hard, and hopefully, very soon they'll say you're going to play football. And I hope they're not leaving Michigan out because it's never the same if they do. But you have Maryland, where they have a problem in terms of playing. And the governors have a lot of power over that. They have a lot of power, a lot of say. So let's play Big Ten football, right? They want to shut down auto production, delay the vaccine. They want to destroy your suburbs. Look at what I've done for your suburbs. You know what I've done. You know what I've done. Does anybody want to have somebody from Antifa as a member and as a resident of your suburb? I don't think so too much. Say, ""Darling, who moved in next door?"" ""Oh, it's a resident of Antifa."" ""No, thank you. Let's get out of here. Let's get the hell out of here, darling. Let's leave our suburbs. I wish Trump were president. He wouldn't have allowed that to happen."" And that's exactly right, I won't allow it to happen. The suburbs are the American dream, and I will tell you, I have protected your suburbs. I got rid of a regulation that played with your zoning and played with other things, where they force projects into the suburbs of our great country. And I got rid of it. They said, ""Sir, we can amend it and make it less crazy."" I said, ""No, I don't want to amend it. I don't want to do that. I want to get rid of it."" ""Well, sir, why don't we just do a simple amendment? It would be"" … I said, ""I want to get rid of it. End it."" And we ended it. We ended it. I think the people living in the suburbs … which I know very well. I watched Westchester in New York where they were doing things that should never have been done, and it's not going to happen to our suburbs. They want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in our schools. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. For the last four years, they've tried everything to stop us, and they are only getting more desperate by the day. Can you imagine if on September 3rd, they say, ""Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has been declared the winner. Donald Trump has been declared"" … At first, they'll go crazy. And then they'll say, ""Okay, it's time now to be reasonable."" They will have had it. They will have had it. We were coming together as a nation. Very interesting. Before the plague came in from China, we will coming together. It was success. Somebody said, ""What's going to bring you together?"" And it was. We were coming together. I was starting to get calls from Democrats that … Frankly, we didn't speak much. And I was starting to get calls, and then all of a sudden we saw the plague pour in, and we saw what was happening, and it really stopped things. But success was getting very, very close to bringing us all together. And then we had to say, ""Let's take a time out. We got to fix this mess."" And we did, and now we're coming back strong, but success brings us together, and it was happening, and then we got that terrible situation happened, and we'll never forget it. Biden and his party tried to lock law-abiding Americans into their homes while they encourage rioters and vandals rampaging through, in all cases, Democrat-run cities. Republican-run cities are doing very well. I hope you know that. And I hope you know, like in Minneapolis, we were asked to come in, we went in, we took care of that problem in about, what, 30 minutes? Unfortunately, they let almost two weeks go by. And if you look at what we just did in Wisconsin, which was so amazing, three days, and we went in. And by the way, the US Marshals went in to get the killer, and that was the end of that. They got the killer, they got the killer. You know what I'm talking about. And we were going to go into Seattle. The next day, we're all set, all lined up, looking forward to it. We just said, ""We're doing it."" I mean, they actually took over a part of the city, and the mayor said, ""This is going to be a summer of love,"" right? Where do these people come from? But we were all set to go in there, heard we were going in, we informed them we're going in, and they sent their police to do it, and we never even had to go in. But we can solve those problems in a matter of literally minutes. Thank you. Don't say that, I'll start to cry, and that wouldn't be good for my image. You don't want to see me cry. I'll start to cry. One of the fake news broadcasters, because this happened the other day, we had a tremendous crowd like this. I mean, we had a tremendous crowd in North Carolina. They started chanting, ""We love you. We love you. We love you."" And it's incredible, they said with all the years that they've been covering presidential elections, they've never heard that chant that, ""We love you."" No, it's very nice. No, they've never heard it. True. Now they'll say, ""He misrepresented. 18 years ago, there was a rally held by somebody, and we heard the words from two people that, ‘We love you, sir.'"" Now this is what we're dealing with. And by the way, I look out, there's a lot of people that … Look at this. There's people back there that can't even get in. Thank you, Michigan. Thank you. It's really nice to be with you. As president, I will always support the heroes of law enforcement. I was very honored to receive the endorsement of the Police Officers Association of Michigan. Where are they? Where are they? They're here someplace. Where are they? Thank you, fellows. That's really nice. I'll tell you. That's an honor. I have to be honest. I got it from Florida, Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, South … But Michigan is Michigan. Thank you. I don't think there's any law enforcement officer that is against us. What is our poll number? 99. I know they had 365,000 at one group, and they got a unanimous vote. I said, ""That's pretty good"". How can you go the other way? You people are fantastic, and we love you. Thank you. That's great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Biden says he wants to protect Black lives, but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of young African American citizens. Thousands. The murder rate in Democrat-run cities like Chicago, Baltimore, New York, so many others is higher than in Afghanistan, yet Biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide. You will have crime like you've never seen before. You'll have crime like you've never seen. Last week, Joe Biden proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal Portland district attorney, who has a policy of releasing rioters, criminals, and violent extremists without charge. Biden's plan … And every time I say Biden's plan, it's not his plan, it's the people that tell them what they're going to do, so please understand. I just don't want to say that every time I mention his name. So it should say, ""The people that control Biden's plan"" is to appease domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them, to lock them up. If Joe Biden is elected, far left lunatics won't just be running failed Democrat city, they'll be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Supreme Court, and we can't let that happen. No city, town, or suburb will be safe. On November 3rd, your vote will save America. Remember, it's the most important election we've ever had. I'm joined tonight by some great warriors that have really helped me a lot in Washington with the fake impeachment, the impeachment hoax, the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. Somebody said Russia's coming up again. Adam Schiff said, ""We'd like to find out about"" … I said, ""What about China? What about other countries?"" It's always Russia. Russia, Russia. They're at it again. I want to just thank these guys because these were real warriors for all of us. They love your state, and they love our country. Congressman Jack Bergman. Great job, Jack. John Moolenaar. Thank you, John. Great. Great going, John. He's a tough cookie. And Tim Walberg. Tim, thank you. Great job. What great people. And I talked about him a little while before, I could talk about him all night. He's a star. He's going to be a future star. We have a very much different party than we had four years ago. We're now the party of the workers. We're the party of a lot of different things now, but we weren't really considered the party of the workers. Certainly not anymore. Remember this, we're the party of Abraham Lincoln. A lot of people forget that. Honestly. Remember when they used to say, ""he doesn't act presidential""? And I used to say, ""It's so easy to be presidential."" I'd only have about 10 or 15 people here. You'd be bored. But remember I used to do that? But I'd always say, ""I can be more presidential than any president in our history, except for the possibility of Abraham Lincoln when he wears his hat."" Tough to beat. That's tough to beat, John James. But seriously, if you want to be well-represented … Your current Senator, I don't even know this guy. I don't even know this guy. Nobody does. They don't know who he is. They don't even know. He comes into the office, I say, ""Who is that guy?"" I know every Senator. Democrat, Republican. I don't know this guy. I know your other Senator. I can tell by her hair. She's got interesting hair. But that was John's first crack. He learned a lot. And frankly, and I mean this, if he had more support from the Republican Party, he would've won that race. He would've. But this guy Peters, right? Peters. I say, ""Who's Peters?"" Nobody knows him. He doesn't do anything. I mean, look, we're going to end this, but I have to tell you, John James can be so great. He loves our country. He's been educated at the highest level. He was always the top at everything he's ever done. And this is what he has. And I'll be honest with you, John. I think I can tell this story. John and I were thinking about John. I was thinking about John more than myself because I know talent. And I said, ""John, you can run for a certain House seat, right? And you're guaranteed to win. You can run for another House seat. It'll be a tough race, but you're going to win. Or you can have a tough race against somebody that nobody ever heard of. It's like a habit that they press that particular trigger, but that's a tough race. So you can be an absolute Congressman, or you can take a shot at this one."" He said, ""Sir, I can do more in the Senate than I can do in the House."" And that was his decision. Right? Took a lot of guts. So John, I'm with you. You have my total and complete endorsement. You have everything I can do. Everything I can do, we will do for you. And I really believe you're going to make it. You're running against somebody that is just ridiculous, folks. It's ridiculous. Don't do it. Also with us are some other great candidates and people that are going to do a tremendous job, helping our Congressman. Paul Junge. Where's Paul Junge? Paul, thank you. Good luck. I heard you're doing well, Paul. Paul Junge. Lisa McClain. Lisa? Great job. It's going well. And Eric Essahki. Thank you, Eric. Good luck. Good luck. We're going to be out here helping you, too. We're going to be out here. I hope John doesn't even need help, but we're going to help John, too. We're going to help all of you. All right? We're going to be doing it. Thank you. Also with you is RNC Chairwoman. She was the head of the whole state, and she kept calling me back, back. ""Sir, one more speech, you're going to win Michigan."" Hadn't been won in decades. ""One more speech, sir, you're going to win Michigan."" I said, ""All right. Ron, I'm coming in one more time, but that's it."" I said, ""That woman is the most aggressive person I've ever met."" She said, ""I'm telling you, sir, one more speech."" I said, ""All right, I'll do it one more time, but that's it."" About a day after I got back, I said, ""I just got back from Michigan. It was wonderful."" I get a call from Ronna McDaniel, and she goes, ""Sir, could you come in tomorrow for another speech?"" Well, whatever happens, she is the one that got me here at midnight on … She is. So when it came time to picking the head of the RNC, as president, you have a couple of things to say about it, right? I said, ""Who's that woman that kept getting me back to Michigan? Boy oh boy, she'll be great."" Ronna McDaniel. And somebody's doing a fantastic job and tells us we're really pretty far ahead. Maybe way ahead. They had a poll. I think it was a Gallup poll. They said 62% of the people are lying about their poll. Now, they're only lying having to do with my … And I don't know if I'm supposed to be insulted by that or not, but we'll take it. But we could have a very big win. And look, no president has done for Michigan what President Trump has done for Michigan. And you're going to remember that. And I'm going to remember Michigan. Michigan GOP Chair Laura Cox. Great. Thank you. Great job. Great job. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks, Laura. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. 47 years of bad votes. After the last administration nearly killed the US auto industry, I saved the US auto industry. Joe Biden supported the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for American auto jobs. I withdrew from the TPP my first week in office. That was so easy. That was so easy. You wouldn't have been making cars. You would've been buying cars from foreign lands. We have enough of that. Biden supported the horrendous South Korea deal that would've wiped out US production of the pickup truck, which is the most … The pickup truck is the most profitable thing the auto industry makes. You know why? We have something called the Chicken Tax. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? The Chicken Tax. It's a tariff of 25%, and it keeps other countries out of here, and it expired, and South Korea didn't want to do it, but they did it. We got it right back, and we put it on for a long time, and now you're making … But remember this, go check it out. The Chicken Tax. I'll tell you why someday at another meeting why they call it that. Maybe you don't want to know about it. But we're keeping those small trucks, and we're keeping our whole industry good. And we're expanding our autos now, our cars, and we're doing a great job of it, and I want to thank everybody. Doing a great job. And by the way, many other things in Michigan. Biden supported the outrageous fuel economy standards that have hammered the auto industry, and I reversed that rule. I actually reversed it, and it helped millions of families be able to afford a car. The United States lost 500 auto and auto parts factories under the Obama-Biden disaster. Before the virus, my administration added over 200 new auto and auto parts plants. How about 200? I didn't know that. 200. 200. I thought it was a little less than that. Wait, I want to see that again. 200. It's … … than that. Wait, I want to see that again, 200. It says 200. Do you believable it? That's a lot. You know, I have a choice between teleprompter and freelance. I hate to say, the freelance is always a hell of a lot better, but … If you remember, and you remember well, I actually got elected because of freelance. We didn't have teleprompters. There were no teleprompters. But think of that, 200, we're talking about 200 plants. I thought it was a much lower number. I thought you should put me in an office based on a much lower number. At 200, you have no choice. Yesterday, Biden was in Michigan. He said, ""I better get out of the basement."" This guy is starting to do very well lying about his lifetime of cold hearted globalist betrayals. Biden championed NAFTA, perhaps the worst trade deal in the history of our country. He continued to embrace and promote NAFTA for decades. I told you, he just said it was not as good as the deal I made. I can't believe, oh they're giving him hell tonight. They're giving him hell. What did you say that for? Boy oh boy. Yeah, hiding. ‘Joe Hiden.' Look, this doesn't sound nice. I'll say it, and they'll criticize for it, you watch. But I have the distinct pleasure of running against the worst presidential candidate in the history of presidential politics. I really believe that. I do. Can you imagine if I lost to him? I'd have to say I lost to the worst candidate ever put up. Don't do that to me, Michigan. Don't do that. Biden supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, which, by the way, was a disaster. China was flatlining for years and years and decades and it got into this World Trade Organization with all sorts of advantages. Just a terrible, terrible situation took place. That's when China became a big, powerful economic power. But, if you look at the numbers just before the plague, now, the numbers are different, we were going up, up, up, we were beating them like a drum. They weren't even close. We were gaining, gaining, gaining. We were number one by far. You know, for years I've heard that in 2019, China was going to surpass us. Well, in 2019, we gained a lot on them. We were doing great. We were doing great and we'll be doing even better next year, you watch. Yesterday it was revealed that a fund partly owned by Joe Biden's son, where's Hunter? See his first name, I now name … His first name is where. Where's Hunter? He must be a brilliant guy because with no experience he's taken more money from more countries. He had no job and then he became rich. But where's Hunter who facilitated the sale of a Michigan automotive company to a leading Chinese military defense contractor? Does anyone know that China's military got yet another piece of American manufacturing, Mike and the Biden family made a lot of money on it. It was a lot of money. What about Ukraine? He got $183,000 a month, $3 million upfront and he had no experience with energy, working for an energy company, by the way. What's your experience, Hunter? What's your experience with energy? ""I don't have any."" ""Okay. We'll pay you 183,000 a month and I will give you an upfront payment, Hunter, of $3 million. Will that be satisfactory?"" He goes, ""Yes. I'll take it."" Would anybody here not take that deal? Anybody? Please raise your head. This is one guy, right, you must be a pretty rich guy. If Biden's elected, China will own America. Washington vultures like Biden and others ripped apart entire towns all across your state. Michigan lost half of all manufacturing jobs after the trade deals that Biden supported. By the way, I don't know if anybody … But does anybody remember like 12 years ago? Long before I thought about running for president, when I enjoyed my life, I had the greatest life. ""Where would we like to go? Let's go to Monte-Carlo this weekend. Let's go."" No, I had a great life, but I was honored. I was doing very well. I was honored in Michigan. Does anybody know that? I was given man of the year award by somebody? I came in and I spent like 45 minutes talking about how you've been ripped off, how all your auto companies are leaving and going to Mexico and, by the way, to Canada too. But how they're all leaving and going to Mexico and Canada. I spent the whole time talking about it. At the end I felt embarrassed, I said, ""I hope I haven't insulted the state too much, but why do you let this happen?"" I stopped it. I stopped. It won't be happening. It won't be happening. It's not going to happen anymore. Biden took a sledgehammer to your state earlier this year, I kept my promise to Michigan workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare that everybody said was impossible to end, and when we signed that brand new US- Mexico-Canada agreement into law. The USMCA includes powerful wage protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan. Now they have a tremendous disincentive to leave Michigan, fire all of our workers, go to Mexico or Canada, make the car or the product, send it in here without tariffs. We end up with closed factories, no job and no taxes. That's not happening anymore. That's not happening anymore. But do you remember how bad it was just before I took office? It was like an avalanche of companies leaving our country. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of Michigan jobs. Biden has vowed to remove these tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging. Just so you know, China's paying us tens of billions of dollars a month. Before me, China never paid anything. They didn't pay us 25 cents. You know what I did with some of that money? I gave it to our farmers. I don't know if we have a lot, do we have farmers here? We have farmers. Raise your hands farmers. That's not bad No, I gave $28 billion to our farmers because they were targeted by China. They were targeted. They said, ""You know …"" and that's what they did in the past to other presidents. They said, ""If you do this, we're going to stop doing business with your farmers and you're not going to be able to get any votes and you're going to lose the Midwest and all of that."" I said, ""You know what? I do, whatever you want."" Then I went to Sonny Perdue, Secretary Of Agriculture, a great guy, I said, Sonny, ""How much are they being targeted for?"" ""Sir, $12 billion the first year, two years, three years ago, and then 16 billion, a total of 28 billion."" I said, ""That's okay. We're putting tariffs on everything they send into our country, 25%."" Was going to raise it to 50%. Also, 10% at 12%, all different tariffs. We took in billions and billions, and I said, ""You know what we're going to do? We're going to take, of that, the 12 and the 16, $28 billion and we're going to give it to our farmers who were targeted,"" and our farmers are doing great. That's what we did. Do you think Joe Biden would do that? He wouldn't have a clue. Hillary wouldn't have had a clue. Crazy Bernie wouldn't have, nobody would add a clue on that one. By the way, we had tens of billions of dollars left over. You know what I did with that? We gave it to the US Treasury, right smack into the heart of the US Treasury. And we're still getting those big tariffs. Even though we made a trade deal with China. I said, ""No, you got to leave the tariffs on."" A lot of people didn't know it. Schumer went, ""Well, I don't like to do …"" First of all, he didn't like tariffs, and then all of a sudden he loves it. But when I made the deal with China, I left the tariffs on 25% and some different amounts. When I left tariffs largely on and nobody could believe it. I said to Schumer, ""What do you think of the deal?"" ""I don't like it because you got rid of the tariffs."" I said, ""No, we left the tariffs on."" This is what it is. No matter how you do it, no matter how good the deal, they'll say, ""It's no good,"" because they don't love the country. They don't love the country. Remember that. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. That's a nice plane. Somebody said to me, ""Your plane's just as nice as that."" I said, ""No, it's not. That's Air Force One. That's the nicest."" Always, that's the nicest. I also authorize millions of dollars to save Michigan Soo Locks, and forget all the problems they had. For years and years, they fought over the money to do it. We got $300 million to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and we have done a job on the Soo Locks. They were rotting you. Weren't going to have anything come through the Soo Locks. It's all done. That deal is all done. It's all done. Right? Thank you. Thank you. Where are my guys there? Good job. Right. Even though you're law enforcement, that's a good job, right? Two months ago, I also issued a major disaster declaration in response to the catastrophic flooding caused by the failure of the Edenville dam. Where are the people from Edenville? Yeah, good. No, that was a terrible thing and they're working very hard right now. We're providing more than $43 million in federal funds to help homeowners, businesses and communities in central Michigan to recover from that catastrophe. Thank you. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history. We've ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported over 20,000 vicious gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens. As I said, we've already built over 310 miles of border wall. It's all going to be finished very quickly. We're averaging about 10 new, brand new, beautiful miles every single week. It'll be finished very short. We've invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. All made in the USA, by the way. All made in the USA. You know, with the fake news today, I said, ""And we have systems and missiles and rockets and military and tech. We have systems that you've never even seen before. President Xi has nothing like it. Putin has nothing like it. Nobody has anything like what we have."" They said, ""Is he giving away military information?"" No, I'm saying, ""We have the greatest weapons in the world."" That's what I'm saying. They said, ""He may be giving away classified information."" You don't have to worry about it. These people are sick. Never speak well about our technology because you're giving away classified information. Now, I just want to let people know, we have the greatest systems, the greatest equipment and the greatest people anywhere in the world. There's nobody like the US military. We have the most powerful military in the world. When I took it over, it was depleted. It was in trouble and was exhausted from these ridiculous, endless wars that lasts 19 and 20 years, and you know, those soldiers are starting to come home very big. You know that right?. We passed the MISSION Act, we call it VA Choice and VA Accountability. We hold people accountable if they don't treat our vets good, you're fired. Get out. You're fine. We did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. That's true. We did more. That sort of has a nice ring to it. Right? Think of it. We did more and it's true. Just take a look, Space Force, by itself, that would be a major achievement, and with us, we did so many things, so many things. But we did more in 47 months than he did in 47 years. It's true. It's true. A lot of what I did is destroy some of the horrible things that they did, including regulations all over the place. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We paid $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash. We ought to speak to law enforcement about that. How do we send 1.8 billion in cash? In cash? You guys ought to take a look at that please. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Every president said they were going to do that and none of them did it, for decades and decades, they all said. I tell this story, it was a hard thing to get done. It was easy to talk about in the campaign, ""We're going to open up the embassy in Jerusalem. We're going to make it. It becomes automatically the capital of Israel."" Everybody said it for very, very many decades, for decades, many presidents. But I realize now why it was an effort because as soon as I got in, I was lobbied by everybody, ""Please don't do it. Don't do it. Don't make the capital of Israel Jerusalem. Don't move your embassy."" So went on and on. Then I said, ""Let's do it anyway."" It's true. And the word got out. The word got out that I was going to do it, and I was called by every king and every queen and every prime minister and every … Everybody was calling me, ""Please sir, don't do it. Please."" So I did what we sometimes will do in business, I told them … When a king calls, when somebody calls, an Emir, when somebody calls, tell them, ""I'll call them back in a few days. I'm sorry, sir. He won't be able to speak right now, he'll call you back on Wednesday. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it."" On Tuesday, I announced that I'm doing it. Then I got on the phone with 18 different companies. I go, ""Hey, how you doing? You called, I'm just returning your call."" ""Oh, it's too late, sir. We called about Israel. It's too late."" I said, ""Gee, I'm sorry. I wish you got to me a little bit sooner."" I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades. And by the way, on Wednesday, I believe of next week, Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and as you know, the country, a very powerful, very respected country with a great leader, the UAE, is coming to the White House and we're going to sign an agreement that hasn't been signed in many decades. It's peace and its recognition of Israel and all of the things, nobody thought it could be done. It's an amazing thing. I don't say this out of ego, but I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Now, I have to tell you, that's sort of a big thing and the networks and most of the news didn't cover it. Could you imagine? When Obama came to office, they said, ""We're going to give him the Nobel Peace Prize."" He actually said, ""What did I do? I didn't do anything."" He didn't do anything for eight years, frankly. But he said, ""What did I do?"" They gave it to them in a matter of weeks, right? Weeks. With us, we've done so much. We have done so much on so many different fronts. Remember North Korea? Remember? They were going to be at war with North Korea. Where's the war? Where's the war? Where's the war? And we have a good relationship with Kim Jong-un. Who knows what happens? All I know is, we're not in war and that's okay. They said, ""But he gave away so much."" I said, ""I gave away nothing."" ""No, he gave away so much."" When I said, ""What did they give away?"" You know what they said? ""Uh, we don't know."" I said, ""Here's what I gave away, I gave away nothing."" They said, ""Oh, but you agreed to meet."" Oh, I see. I agreed to meet. So now they're saying, ""I agreed to meet, it was such a big deal."" Instead of being in a war, I think agreeing to meet is okay, right? And we did. He's a different kind of a guy and he's a smart guy, a very smart guy. We get along. Getting along with foreign powers is not a bad thing. We're trying to teach that to the media and these idiots that ran our government for so many years. These fools. These fools. You know, you got nuclear weapons, you got big armies, big navies, ""He gets along with Putin. That's a terrible thing."" No, it's a good thing. If I get along, that's good. He likes me. I like him. Not so bad. ""He gets along with Kim Jong-un."" … Not so bad. He gets along with Kim Jong-Un. That's a terrible thing. No, it's a good thing. I'm trying to convince him. It's okay. It's okay not to go to war. It's really okay. He gets along with President Xi, he gets along with Prime Minister Abe. He gets along with a lot of people, and it's okay. That's a good thing. It's really hard. These stupid people that have been running this operation for 30, 40 years, and they come out against me, and all they did was stick us in these endless wars. We're fighting for sand and blood. Sand and blood. Syria, what do you get out of it? You get sand, you get blood, you get injuries, you get death. These people don't know what the hell they're doing and it's one of the reasons I got elected, I can tell you that. We don't like his foreign policy. And this is said by one of the guy's that got us into the war in Iraq, got us into the Middle East. So, it's … We're doing a great job. We're doing a great job for you. We're doing a great job for Michigan. Just to finish in the Middle East, we killed the founder and leader of Isis, Al-Baghdadi. And by the way, we're pulling back and we're doing everything so beautifully. If we do get into war, we win the war. We don't fight for nothing. We fought for nothing. We don't ever want to have war but if there is a war, nobody's going to even come close to being able to beat us. And we won't be depleted from fighting in all these ridiculous locations all over the globe. You people know that a lot better than the idiots in Washington that has represented us for 35 years. We took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops, Qasem Soleimani is dead. We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home, and they're coming home very rapidly. You see that. Sleepy Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War. He supported the Defense Sequester that gutted our military, destroyed our military, set us back so many years. I got rid of it immediately. He opposed the mission to take out Osama Bin Laden. He was against it. Everything he did, he was wrong on as said by Gates, you know? Secretary of Defense, Secretary of everything. He was sort of like … He had more jobs than any human being I've ever seen. But he said, ""Everything, everything that Biden was for was wrong."" He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of Isis. He was unable to do anything with Isis. as he came to the White House two weeks ago. And we cheered as we looked at all of the success that we've had but he really oversaw the rise of China as a positive development. Remember, he said, ""No, it's a positive development for America and for the world."" He's been in Washington for 47 years now. He's all of a sudden going to change? He's going to change? He's not going to change. Don't forget, he was in Washington in his primetime, which was never considered great, and now it's no longer primetime. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died from the China plague. Biden was willing to sacrifice American lives on the altar of open borders. And now Joe Biden is once again hurting innocent people with his dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, putting millions of lives around the world at risk. And the only reason he's doing that is he knows we're right next to having a vaccine. So, he wants to belittle the vaccine because he doesn't want us to get credit plant, who converted their factory to produce tens of thousands of ventilators, after we invoked the Defense Production Act, and they've done a fantastic job. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator any time in our whole country. They needed a ventilator, we had nothing. We were left, bare cupboards. I always say the cupboards were bare. We're delivering lifesaving therapies, and have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates anywhere of any country in the world. Europe's excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the rate in the United States. You don't hear that from the fake news. Hey, America will prevail over the China virus, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" That's it. We're doing very well. As the British government advised the British people in the face of World War II, ""Keep calm and carry on."" That's what I did. This whack job that wrote the book, he said, ""Well, Trump knew a little bit."" They wanted me to come out and scream, ""People are dying, we're dying."" No, no, we did it just the right way. We have to be calm. We don't want to be crazed lunatics. We have to lead. When Hitler was bombing, I don't know if you know this, when Hitler was bombing London, Churchill, great leader, would oftentimes go to a roof in London and speak, and he always spoke with calmness. He said, ""We have to show calmness."" No, we did it the right way and we've done a job like nobody. All of those great generals, all of those great admirals, our great vice president, Mike Pence, they did a fantastic job. Our doctors, and they don't get any credit because they want to discredit us as much as possible because they want it to carry over to November 3rd, but we've done a fantastic job. I think we've probably done the best job of any country, certainly of any major country anywhere in the world on the pandemic. Through our historic relief programs, we've saved more than 1.6 million Michigan jobs, and over 128,000 Michigan businesses. Michigan has already gained and regained more than half of the jobs that it lost, and if your state was ever allowed to safely reopen by your governor who doesn't have a clue. She's like Joe. You would have regained far more than that. Open up your state, Madam Governor, open up your state. Let's go. Just like crazy Nancy Pelosi, your governor is a liberal hypocrite who lives by a different set of rules. Her husband was caught trying to put his boat in the water on Memorial Day weekend while she was ordering the people of Michigan to stay in their homes, and forcing businesses into bankruptcy left and right. The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy this great opportunity that we're having right now. He would impose job destroying regulations that would demolish the auto industry. You know, on regulations, it took, in many cases, 18, 19, 20 years to get a roadway or a highway approved. We have it down now to two years. We're trying to get it down to one year, and it may get disapproved for environmental or safety reasons, but we're going to know about it very fast. No more 20 year approvals or disapprovals. He wants to force you to provide free government healthcare to illegal aliens. He will destroy your social security. He will destroy your protections for pre-existing conditions, and we will save social security. Remember they said last time? ""Oh, Trump is going to destroy social security."" Well, it's now four years, we haven't touched it. We've protected it, and that's going to remain that way. Biden opposes school choice and has stated that if he's elected, charter schools, so important, are gone. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans, instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we have been through, we are changing Washington. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in Michigan. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity, and that's already happening. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities, and we will ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. And you're lucky I'm here because you're Second Amendment would be gone if I wasn't. And they didn't touch it. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep out people, keep them out of these horrible, horrible situations where they hurt our country, they hurt the people of our country, and we're also going to be staying out of the endless ridiculous foreign wars in countries that you've never even heard of. We will build the most powerful missile and cyber defense. We've already got it, pretty much. And we will maintain peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require the biggest thing that nobody even knows about and it's all signed and it goes into effect on January 1st. You better make sure I win. Can you imagine? This is going to be the biggest thing and nobody understands what it is. You'll figure it out. Price transparency. Did they fight me on that one. January 1st. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs at a level like you've never seen before. I've already signed it. Favored Nations. The drug companies are not happy, I will tell you. Just, all you have to do is take a look at all the ads they're running against me. Favored Nations, where we pay whatever the lowest is in the world, we pay that number. We will protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect our patients. We will always our people. We will your pre-existing conditions, as I said. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will restore patriotic education, you know what I mean by that, and we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust. And I don't know if you saw it, but during the Democrat National Convention and Caucus, they took twice, I thought I was sort of, maybe they made a mistake, you saw that, they took the word God out of the Pledge of Allegiance twice. And then they said, ""Oh, well maybe it was a mistake."" It wasn't a mistake. That's where they're coming from. Don't be foolish. That's where they're coming from and there's nothing that Sleepy Joe Biden can do about it. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for Michigan. So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and your coworkers, and get out and vote. So important. From Grand Rapids to Saginaw, from Kalamazoo to Mackinac, and from Flint to right here in Freeland, we stand on the shoulders of generations of Michigan patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line. It's the place where General Motors, Chrysler and Kellogg revolutionized entire industries. Michigan, well, you know this one, right? Michigan gave us Motown, right? That's right. That's right, Motown. We love Motown. Michigan gave us Motown, gave us Motown, gave us the Mustang and the unrivaled might of the American Midwest. This is the state where tough, strong and determined workers made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together, we will be taking back our country, we'll be taking it back from people that don't love our country and that take back is almost complete. We have to win on November 3rd. We're returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, we are going to keep on winning. Vote for John James. John James. We need John James. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God, and together, with the incredible people of Michigan, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Michigan. We love you, Michigan. Thank you. Thank you.",Trump
