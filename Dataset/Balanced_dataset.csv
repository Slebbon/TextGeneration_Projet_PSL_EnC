Trump,Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
Trump,"""Stay on message"" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!"
Trump,I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
Trump,"It is not ""freedom of the press"" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!"
Trump,"I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!"
Trump,Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
Trump,My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
Trump,"If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didnt put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%"
Trump,"The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said"
Trump,The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!
Trump,"""@zulu_out: You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U"" Thanks"
Trump,"""@PaulaDuvall2: Were all enjoying you, as well, Mr. T.! Youve inspired Hope and a Positive Spirit throughout America! God bless you!"" Nice"
Trump,"""@need2knowu:  @willspeakout yes you are my hero I admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for America!!!"""
Trump,We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.
Trump,"""@willspeakout: Thank you for all that you are doing for us! You campaign endlessly and have spent millions.We love you! #TrumpTrain"" Thanks"
Trump,I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!
Trump,The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!

Trump,On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
Trump,Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - cant make a deal work.
Trump,Shows how weak and desperate Lyin Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly cant stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
Trump,Lyin Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
Trump,Lyin Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp; special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
Trump,"Wow, just announced that Lyin Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!"

Trump,Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!
Trump,He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Trump,"Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDNT KEEP THEM! Hi DT"
Trump,".@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize!"
Trump,"Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!"
Trump,There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!
Trump,I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!
Trump,"THANK YOU- Clemson, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #SCPrimary https://t.co/FgACmaFxxc"
Trump,"""@HARyder: Which is it @realDonaldTrump ?Are you planning on getting rid of Common Core or keeping it?  Get rid of it fast."
Trump,I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.
Trump,Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd!
Trump,"So funny, Jeb Bush called me a ""highly gifted politician and a great entertainer"" - I assume that is a compliment!"
Trump,Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.
Trump,"Like the worthless @NYDailyNews, looks like @politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money, no cred!"
Trump,"Worthless @NYDailyNews, which dopey Mort Zuckerman, is desperately trying to sell, has no buyer! Liabilities are massive!"
Trump,"Dopey Mort Zuckerman, owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews, has a major inferiority complex. Paper will close soon!"
Trump,Will be on @foxandfriends at 8:15 A.M.
Trump,"""@MarkHalperin: My report card grades for the 2 New Hampshire winners: DonaldTrump A: v strong energy/close. BernieSanders B+: went too long"
Trump,"Thank you to the people of  New Hampshire, I love you! Now, off to South Carolina."
Trump,"Thank you, New Hampshire! Departing with my amazing family now! #FITN #NHPrimary

Trump,We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security.
Trump,We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $s and have much better healthcare!
Trump,"ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our ""leader"" - If I win it will be a very different story,with very fast results"
Trump,New Hampshire vote today -  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Trump,The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great!
Trump,No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!
Trump,"I know the ""Governors"" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!"
Trump,"Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION (""come as act of love""). Not a leader!"

Trump,"Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a ""natural born Canadian,"" did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?"
Trump,"Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didnt report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate."
Trump,"The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wifes employer, and his lender, is located there!"

Shakespeare,"Culling of simples, meagre were his looks,"
Shakespeare,Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
Shakespeare,"And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,"
Shakespeare,"An alligator stuff'd, and other skins"
Shakespeare,"Of ill-shaped fishes, and about his shelves"
Shakespeare,"A beggarly account of empty boxes,"

Shakespeare,Who calls so loud?

Shakespeare,That the life-weary taker may fall dead
Shakespeare,And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
Shakespeare,As violently as hasty powder fired
Shakespeare,Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
Shakespeare,"Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua's law"
Shakespeare,Is death to any he that utters them.
Shakespeare,"Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,"
Shakespeare,"And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,"
Shakespeare,"Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,"
Shakespeare,"Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back,"
Shakespeare,"The world is not thy friend nor the world's law,"
Shakespeare,"The world affords no law to make thee rich,"
Shakespeare,"Then be not poor, but break it, and take this."
Shakespeare,"My poverty, but not my will, consents."
Shakespeare,"I pay thy poverty, and not thy will."
Shakespeare,"Put this in any liquid thing you will,"
Shakespeare,"And drink it off, and, if you had the strength"
Shakespeare,"Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight."
Shakespeare,"There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,"
Shakespeare,"Doing more murders in this loathsome world,"
Shakespeare,Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
Shakespeare,"I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none."
Shakespeare,"Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh."
Shakespeare,"Come, cordial and not poison, go with me"
Shakespeare,"To Juliet's grave, for there must I use thee."

Shakespeare,Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
Shakespeare,"Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter."
Shakespeare,Going to find a bare-foot brother out
Shakespeare,"One of our order, to associate me,"
Shakespeare,"Here in this city visiting the sick,"
Shakespeare,"And finding him, the searchers of the town,"
Shakespeare,Suspecting that we both were in a house
Shakespeare,"Where the infectious pestilence did reign,"
Shakespeare,"Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,"
Shakespeare,So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
Shakespeare,"Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?"
Shakespeare,"I could not send it,--here it is again,--"
Shakespeare,"Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,"
Shakespeare,So fearful were they of infection.
Shakespeare,"Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,"
Shakespeare,The letter was not nice but full of charge
Shakespeare,"Of dear import, and the neglecting it"
Shakespeare,"May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,"
Shakespeare,"Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight"
Shakespeare,Unto my cell.
Shakespeare,"Brother, I'll go and bring it thee."
Shakespeare,"Now must I to the monument alone,"
Shakespeare,Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
Shakespeare,She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Shakespeare,"Hath had no notice of these accidents,"
Shakespeare,"But I will write again to Mantua,"
Shakespeare,"And keep her at my cell till Romeo come,"
Shakespeare,"Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!"
Shakespeare,"SCENE III. A churchyard, in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets."
Shakespeare,"Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch"
Shakespeare,"Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:"
Shakespeare,"Yet put it out, for I would not be seen."
Shakespeare,"Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,"
Shakespeare,"Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground,"
Shakespeare,"So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,"
Shakespeare,"Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,"
Shakespeare,"But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,"
Shakespeare,As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
Shakespeare,"Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go."
Shakespeare,[Aside]  I am almost afraid to stand alone
Shakespeare,"Here in the churchyard, yet I will adventure."
Shakespeare,"Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--"
Shakespeare,"O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones,--"
Shakespeare,"Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,"
Shakespeare,"Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:"
Shakespeare,The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Shakespeare,Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
Shakespeare,The Page whistles
Shakespeare,The boy gives warning something doth approach.
Shakespeare,"What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,"
Shakespeare,To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
Shakespeare,"What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile."
Shakespeare,"Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock,  and c"
Shakespeare,Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Shakespeare,"Hold, take this letter, early in the morning"
Shakespeare,See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Shakespeare,"Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,"
Shakespeare,"Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,"
Shakespeare,And do not interrupt me in my course.
Shakespeare,"Why I descend into this bed of death,"
Shakespeare,"Is partly to behold my lady's face,"
Shakespeare,But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
Shakespeare,"A precious ring, a ring that I must use"
Shakespeare,"In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:"
Shakespeare,"But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry"
Shakespeare,"In what I further shall intend to do,"
Shakespeare,"By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint"
Shakespeare,And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
Shakespeare,"The time and my intents are savage-wild,"
Shakespeare,More fierce and more inexorable far
Shakespeare,Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
Shakespeare,"I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you."
Shakespeare,So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
Shakespeare,"Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow."
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:"
Shakespeare,"His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt."
Shakespeare,"Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,"
Shakespeare,"Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,"
Shakespeare,"Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,"
Shakespeare,"And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!"
Shakespeare,Opens the tomb
Shakespeare,"This is that banish'd haughty Montague,"
Shakespeare,"That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,"
Shakespeare,"It is supposed, the fair creature died,"
Shakespeare,And here is come to do some villanous shame
Shakespeare,To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
Shakespeare,Comes forward
Shakespeare,"Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!"
Shakespeare,Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
Shakespeare,"Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:"
Shakespeare,"Obey, and go with me, for thou must die."
Shakespeare,"I must indeed, and therefore came I hither."
Shakespeare,"Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man,"
Shakespeare,"Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone,"
Shakespeare,"Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,"
Shakespeare,"Put not another sin upon my head,"
Shakespeare,"By urging me to fury: O, be gone!"
Shakespeare,"By heaven, I love thee better than myself,"
Shakespeare,For I come hither arm'd against myself:
Shakespeare,"Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,"
Shakespeare,A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
Shakespeare,"I do defy thy conjurations,"
Shakespeare,And apprehend thee for a felon here.
Shakespeare,"Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!"
Shakespeare,"O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch."
Shakespeare,"If thou be merciful,"
Shakespeare,"Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet."
Shakespeare,"In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face."
Shakespeare,"Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!"
Shakespeare,"What said my man, when my betossed soul"
Shakespeare,Did not attend him as we rode? I think
Shakespeare,He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Shakespeare,Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Shakespeare,"Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,"
Shakespeare,"To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,"
Shakespeare,One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
Shakespeare,"I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave,"
Shakespeare,"A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,"
Shakespeare,"For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes"
Shakespeare,This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Shakespeare,"Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd."
Shakespeare,Laying PARIS in the tomb
Shakespeare,How oft when men are at the point of death
Shakespeare,Have they been merry! which their keepers call
Shakespeare,"A lightning before death: O, how may I"
Shakespeare,Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
Shakespeare,"Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,"
Shakespeare,Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Shakespeare,"Thou art not conquer'd, beauty's ensign yet"
Shakespeare,"Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,"
Shakespeare,And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Shakespeare,"Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?"
Shakespeare,"O, what more favour can I do to thee,"
Shakespeare,Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
Shakespeare,To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Shakespeare,"Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,"
Shakespeare,Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
Shakespeare,"That unsubstantial death is amorous,"
Shakespeare,And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Shakespeare,Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
Shakespeare,"For fear of that, I still will stay with thee,"
Shakespeare,And never from this palace of dim night
Shakespeare,"Depart again: here, here will I remain"
Shakespeare,"With worms that are thy chamber-maids, O, here"
Shakespeare,"Will I set up my everlasting rest,"
Shakespeare,And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
Shakespeare,"From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!"
Shakespeare,"Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you"
Shakespeare,"The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss"
Shakespeare,A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Shakespeare,"Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!"
Shakespeare,"Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on"
Shakespeare,The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Shakespeare,Here's to my love!
Shakespeare,O true apothecary!
Shakespeare,Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
Shakespeare,"Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade"
Shakespeare,Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Shakespeare,Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
Shakespeare,"Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well."
Shakespeare,"Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,"
Shakespeare,"What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light"
Shakespeare,"To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,"
Shakespeare,It burneth in the Capel's monument.
Shakespeare,"It doth so, holy sir, and there's my master,"
Shakespeare,One that you love.
Shakespeare,Who is it?
Shakespeare,Romeo.
Shakespeare,How long hath he been there?
Shakespeare,Full half an hour.
Shakespeare,Go with me to the vault.
Shakespeare,"I dare not, sir"
Shakespeare,"My master knows not but I am gone hence,"
Shakespeare,"And fearfully did menace me with death,"
Shakespeare,If I did stay to look on his intents.
Shakespeare,"Stay, then, I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:"
Shakespeare,"O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing."
Shakespeare,"As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,"
Shakespeare,"I dreamt my master and another fought,"
Shakespeare,And that my master slew him.
Shakespeare,Advances
Shakespeare,"Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains"
Shakespeare,The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
Shakespeare,What mean these masterless and gory swords
Shakespeare,To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
Shakespeare,Enters the tomb
Shakespeare,"Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?"
Shakespeare,"And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour"
Shakespeare,Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
Shakespeare,The lady stirs.
Shakespeare,JULIET wakes
Shakespeare,O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
Shakespeare,"I do remember well where I should be,"
Shakespeare,And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
Shakespeare,"I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest"
Shakespeare,"Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:"
Shakespeare,A greater power than we can contradict
Shakespeare,"Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away."
Shakespeare,"Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead,"
Shakespeare,"And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee"
Shakespeare,Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
Shakespeare,"Stay not to question, for the watch is coming,"
Shakespeare,"Come, go, good Juliet,"
Shakespeare,Noise again
Shakespeare,I dare no longer stay.
Shakespeare,"Go, get thee hence, for I will not away."
Shakespeare,Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
Shakespeare,"What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?"
Shakespeare,"Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:"
Shakespeare,"O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop"
Shakespeare,"To help me after? I will kiss thy lips,"
Shakespeare,"Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,"
Shakespeare,To make die with a restorative.
Shakespeare,Kisses him
Shakespeare,Thy lips are warm.
Shakespeare,"[Within]  Lead, boy: which way?"
Shakespeare,"Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!"
Shakespeare,Snatching ROMEO's dagger
Shakespeare,"This is thy sheath,"
Shakespeare,"there rust, and let me die."
Shakespeare,"Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies"
Shakespeare,"Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS"
Shakespeare,"This is the place, there, where the torch doth burn."
Shakespeare,"The ground is bloody, search about the churchyard:"
Shakespeare,"Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach."
Shakespeare,"Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,"
Shakespeare,"And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,"
Shakespeare,Who here hath lain these two days buried.
Shakespeare,"Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:"
Shakespeare,Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
Shakespeare,"We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,"
Shakespeare,But the true ground of all these piteous woes
Shakespeare,We cannot without circumstance descry.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR"
Shakespeare,"Here's Romeo's man, we found him in the churchyard."
Shakespeare,"Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither."
Shakespeare,"Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE"
Shakespeare,"Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:"
Shakespeare,"We took this mattock and this spade from him,"
Shakespeare,As he was coming from this churchyard side.
Shakespeare,A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
Shakespeare,Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
Shakespeare,"What misadventure is so early up,"
Shakespeare,That calls our person from our morning's rest?
Shakespeare,"Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others"
Shakespeare,"What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?"
Shakespeare,"The people in the street cry Romeo,"
Shakespeare,"Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run,"
Shakespeare,With open outcry toward our monument.
Shakespeare,What fear is this which startles in our ears?
Shakespeare,"Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,"
Shakespeare,"And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,"
Shakespeare,Warm and new kill'd.
Shakespeare,"Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes."
Shakespeare,"Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,"
Shakespeare,"With instruments upon them, fit to open"
Shakespeare,These dead men's tombs.
Shakespeare,"O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!"
Shakespeare,"This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house"
Shakespeare,"Is empty on the back of Montague,--"
Shakespeare,And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
Shakespeare,"O me! this sight of death is as a bell,"
Shakespeare,That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
Shakespeare,Enter MONTAGUE and others
Shakespeare,"Come, Montague, for thou art early up,"
Shakespeare,To see thy son and heir more early down.
Shakespeare,"Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night,"
Shakespeare,Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
Shakespeare,What further woe conspires against mine age?
Shakespeare,"Look, and thou shalt see."
Shakespeare,O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
Shakespeare,To press before thy father to a grave?
Shakespeare,"Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,"
Shakespeare,"Till we can clear these ambiguities,"
Shakespeare,"And know their spring, their head, their"
Shakespeare,"true descent,"
Shakespeare,"And then will I be general of your woes,"
Shakespeare,"And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,"
Shakespeare,And let mischance be slave to patience.
Shakespeare,Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
Shakespeare,"I am the greatest, able to do least,"
Shakespeare,"Yet most suspected, as the time and place"
Shakespeare,"Doth make against me of this direful murder,"
Shakespeare,"And here I stand, both to impeach and purge"
Shakespeare,Myself condemned and myself excused.
Shakespeare,Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
Shakespeare,"I will be brief, for my short date of breath"
Shakespeare,Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Shakespeare,"Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,"
Shakespeare,"And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:"
Shakespeare,"I married them, and their stol'n marriage-day"
Shakespeare,"Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death"
Shakespeare,"Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,"
Shakespeare,"For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined."
Shakespeare,"You, to remove that siege of grief from her,"
Shakespeare,Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
Shakespeare,"To County Paris: then comes she to me,"
Shakespeare,"And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean"
Shakespeare,"To rid her from this second marriage,"
Shakespeare,Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Shakespeare,"Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,"
Shakespeare,"A sleeping potion, which so took effect"
Shakespeare,"As I intended, for it wrought on her"
Shakespeare,"The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,"
Shakespeare,"That he should hither come as this dire night,"
Shakespeare,"To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,"
Shakespeare,Being the time the potion's force should cease.
Shakespeare,"But he which bore my letter, Friar John,"
Shakespeare,"Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight"
Shakespeare,Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
Shakespeare,"At the prefixed hour of her waking,"
Shakespeare,"Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,"
Shakespeare,"Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,"
Shakespeare,Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
Shakespeare,"But when I came, some minute ere the time"
Shakespeare,"Of her awaking, here untimely lay"
Shakespeare,The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
Shakespeare,"She wakes, and I entreated her come forth,"
Shakespeare,And bear this work of heaven with patience:
Shakespeare,"But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,"
Shakespeare,"And she, too desperate, would not go with me,"
Shakespeare,"But, as it seems, did violence on herself."
Shakespeare,"All this I know, and to the marriage"
Shakespeare,"Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this"
Shakespeare,"Miscarried by my fault, let my old life"
Shakespeare,"Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,"
Shakespeare,Unto the rigour of severest law.
Shakespeare,We still have known thee for a holy man.
Shakespeare,Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
Shakespeare,"I brought my master news of Juliet's death,"
Shakespeare,And then in post he came from Mantua
Shakespeare,"To this same place, to this same monument."
Shakespeare,"This letter he early bid me give his father,"
Shakespeare,"And threatened me with death, going in the vault,"
Shakespeare,I departed not and left him there.
Shakespeare,"Give me the letter, I will look on it."
Shakespeare,"Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?"
Shakespeare,"Sirrah, what made your master in this place?"
Shakespeare,"He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave,"
Shakespeare,"And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:"
Shakespeare,"Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,"
Shakespeare,"And by and by my master drew on him,"
Shakespeare,And then I ran away to call the watch.
Shakespeare,"This letter doth make good the friar's words,"
Shakespeare,"Their course of love, the tidings of her death:"
Shakespeare,And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Shakespeare,"Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal"
Shakespeare,"Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet."
Shakespeare,Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
Shakespeare,"See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,"
Shakespeare,That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
Shakespeare,And I for winking at your discords too
Shakespeare,Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
Shakespeare,"O brother Montague, give me thy hand:"
Shakespeare,"This is my daughter's jointure, for no more"
Shakespeare,Can I demand.
Shakespeare,But I can give thee more:
Shakespeare,"For I will raise her statue in pure gold,"
Shakespeare,"That while Verona by that name is known,"
Shakespeare,There shall no figure at such rate be set
Shakespeare,As that of true and faithful Juliet.
Shakespeare,"As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie,"
Shakespeare,Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
Shakespeare,"A glooming peace this morning with it brings,"
Shakespeare,"The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:"
Shakespeare,"Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things,"
Shakespeare,"Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:"
Shakespeare,For never was a story of more woe
Shakespeare,Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.
Shakespeare,Enter Hostess and SLY
Shakespeare,"I'll pheeze you, in faith."
Shakespeare,"A pair of stocks, you rogue!"
Shakespeare,"Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues, look in"
Shakespeare,"the chronicles, we came in with Richard Conqueror."
Shakespeare,"Therefore paucas pallabris, let the world slide: sessa!"
Shakespeare,You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
Shakespeare,"No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold"
Shakespeare,"bed, and warm thee."
Shakespeare,"I know my remedy, I must go fetch the"
Shakespeare,third--borough.
Shakespeare,"Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him"
Shakespeare,"by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,"
Shakespeare,and kindly.
Shakespeare,Falls asleep
Shakespeare,"Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train"
Shakespeare,"Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:"
Shakespeare,"Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd,"
Shakespeare,And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
Shakespeare,"Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good"
Shakespeare,"At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?"
Shakespeare,I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
Shakespeare,"Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord,"
Shakespeare,He cried upon it at the merest loss
Shakespeare,And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
Shakespeare,"Trust me, I take him for the better dog."
Shakespeare,"Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,"
Shakespeare,I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
Shakespeare,But sup them well and look unto them all:
Shakespeare,To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
Shakespeare,"What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?"
Shakespeare,"He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,"
Shakespeare,This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
Shakespeare,O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
Shakespeare,"Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!"
Shakespeare,"Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man."
Shakespeare,"What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,"
Shakespeare,"Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,"
Shakespeare,"A most delicious banquet by his bed,"
Shakespeare,"And brave attendants near him when he wakes,"
Shakespeare,Would not the beggar then forget himself?
Shakespeare,"Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose."
Shakespeare,It would seem strange unto him when he waked.
Shakespeare,Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
Shakespeare,Then take him up and manage well the jest:
Shakespeare,Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
Shakespeare,And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
Shakespeare,Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
Shakespeare,And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
Shakespeare,"Procure me music ready when he wakes,"
Shakespeare,"To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound,"
Shakespeare,"And if he chance to speak, be ready straight"
Shakespeare,And with a low submissive reverence
Shakespeare,Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
Shakespeare,Let one attend him with a silver basin
Shakespeare,"Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,"
Shakespeare,"Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,"
Shakespeare,And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
Shakespeare,Some one be ready with a costly suit
Shakespeare,"And ask him what apparel he will wear,"
Shakespeare,"Another tell him of his hounds and horse,"
Shakespeare,And that his lady mourns at his disease:
Shakespeare,"Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,"
Shakespeare,"And when he says he is, say that he dreams,"
Shakespeare,For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
Shakespeare,"This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:"
Shakespeare,"It will be pastime passing excellent,"
Shakespeare,If it be husbanded with modesty.
Shakespeare,"My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,"
Shakespeare,As he shall think by our true diligence
Shakespeare,He is no less than what we say he is.
Shakespeare,"Take him up gently and to bed with him,"
Shakespeare,And each one to his office when he wakes.
Shakespeare,Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds
Shakespeare,"Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:"
Shakespeare,Exit Servingman
Shakespeare,"Belike, some noble gentleman that means,"
Shakespeare,"Travelling some journey, to repose him here."
Shakespeare,Re-enter Servingman
Shakespeare,How now! who is it?
Shakespeare,"An't please your honour, players"
Shakespeare,That offer service to your lordship.
Shakespeare,Bid them come near.
Shakespeare,Enter Players
Shakespeare,"Now, fellows, you are welcome."
Shakespeare,We thank your honour.
Shakespeare,Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
Shakespeare,So please your lordship to accept our duty.
Shakespeare,"With all my heart. This fellow I remember,"
Shakespeare,Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
Shakespeare,'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:
Shakespeare,"I have forgot your name, but, sure, that part"
Shakespeare,Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
Shakespeare,I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
Shakespeare,'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
Shakespeare,"Well, you are come to me in a happy time,"
Shakespeare,The rather for I have some sport in hand
Shakespeare,Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
Shakespeare,There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
Shakespeare,"But I am doubtful of your modesties,"
Shakespeare,"Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--"
Shakespeare,For yet his honour never heard a play--
Shakespeare,You break into some merry passion
Shakespeare,"And so offend him, for I tell you, sirs,"
Shakespeare,If you should smile he grows impatient.
Shakespeare,"Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,"
Shakespeare,Were he the veriest antic in the world.
Shakespeare,"Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,"
Shakespeare,And give them friendly welcome every one:
Shakespeare,Let them want nothing that my house affords.
Shakespeare,Exit one with the Players
Shakespeare,"Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,"
Shakespeare,And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
Shakespeare,"That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber,"
Shakespeare,"And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance."
Shakespeare,"Tell him from me, as he will win my love,"
Shakespeare,"He bear himself with honourable action,"
Shakespeare,Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
Shakespeare,"Unto their lords, by them accomplished:"
Shakespeare,Such duty to the drunkard let him do
Shakespeare,"With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,"
Shakespeare,"And say 'What is't your honour will command,"
Shakespeare,Wherein your lady and your humble wife
Shakespeare,May show her duty and make known her love?'
Shakespeare,"And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,"
Shakespeare,"And with declining head into his bosom,"
Shakespeare,"Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd"
Shakespeare,"To see her noble lord restored to health,"
Shakespeare,Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
Shakespeare,No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
Shakespeare,And if the boy have not a woman's gift
Shakespeare,"To rain a shower of commanded tears,"
Shakespeare,"An onion will do well for such a shift,"
Shakespeare,Which in a napkin being close convey'd
Shakespeare,Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
Shakespeare,See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
Shakespeare,Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
Shakespeare,Exit a Servingman
Shakespeare,"I know the boy will well usurp the grace,"
Shakespeare,"Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:"
Shakespeare,"I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,"
Shakespeare,And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
Shakespeare,When they do homage to this simple peasant.
Shakespeare,"I'll in to counsel them, haply my presence"
Shakespeare,May well abate the over-merry spleen
Shakespeare,Which otherwise would grow into extremes.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. A bedchamber in the Lord's house.
Shakespeare,"Enter aloft SLY, with Attendants, some with apparel, others with basin and ewer and appurtenances, and Lord"
Shakespeare,"For God's sake, a pot of small ale."
Shakespeare,Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?
Shakespeare,Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?
Shakespeare,What raiment will your honour wear to-day?
Shakespeare,"I am Christophero Sly, call not me 'honour' nor"
Shakespeare,"'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life, and if"
Shakespeare,"you give me any conserves, give me conserves of"
Shakespeare,"beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear, for I"
Shakespeare,"have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings"
Shakespeare,"than legs, nor no more shoes than feet, nay,"
Shakespeare,"sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my"
Shakespeare,toes look through the over-leather.
Shakespeare,Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
Shakespeare,"O, that a mighty man of such descent,"
Shakespeare,"Of such possessions and so high esteem,"
Shakespeare,Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
Shakespeare,"What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher"
Shakespeare,"Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a"
Shakespeare,"pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a"
Shakespeare,"bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?"
Shakespeare,"Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if"
Shakespeare,she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence
Shakespeare,"on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the"
Shakespeare,lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not
Shakespeare,bestraught: here's--
Shakespeare,"O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!"
Shakespeare,"O, this is it that makes your servants droop!"
Shakespeare,"Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,"
Shakespeare,As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
Shakespeare,"O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,"
Shakespeare,Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
Shakespeare,And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Shakespeare,"Look how thy servants do attend on thee,"
Shakespeare,Each in his office ready at thy beck.
Shakespeare,"Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,"
Shakespeare,And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
Shakespeare,Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch
Shakespeare,Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
Shakespeare,On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
Shakespeare,"Say thou wilt walk, we will bestrew the ground:"
Shakespeare,"Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,"
Shakespeare,Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Shakespeare,Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
Shakespeare,Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
Shakespeare,Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
Shakespeare,And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.
Shakespeare,"Say thou wilt course, thy greyhounds are as swift"
Shakespeare,"As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe."
Shakespeare,Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
Shakespeare,"Adonis painted by a running brook,"
Shakespeare,"And Cytherea all in sedges hid,"
Shakespeare,"Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,"
Shakespeare,Even as the waving sedges play with wind.
Shakespeare,"We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,"
Shakespeare,"And how she was beguiled and surprised,"
Shakespeare,As lively painted as the deed was done.
Shakespeare,"Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,"
Shakespeare,"Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,"
Shakespeare,"And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,"
Shakespeare,So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
Shakespeare,"Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:"
Shakespeare,Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Shakespeare,Than any woman in this waning age.
Shakespeare,And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
Shakespeare,"Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,"
Shakespeare,"She was the fairest creature in the world,"
Shakespeare,And yet she is inferior to none.
Shakespeare,Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
Shakespeare,Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
Shakespeare,"I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak,"
Shakespeare,I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:
Shakespeare,"Upon my life, I am a lord indeed"
Shakespeare,And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
Shakespeare,"Well, bring our lady hither to our sight,"
Shakespeare,"And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale."
Shakespeare,Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?
Shakespeare,"O, how we joy to see your wit restored!"
Shakespeare,"O, that once more you knew but what you are!"
Shakespeare,"These fifteen years you have been in a dream,"
Shakespeare,"Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept."
Shakespeare,"These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap."
Shakespeare,But did I never speak of all that time?
Shakespeare,"O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:"
Shakespeare,"For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,"
Shakespeare,"Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door,"
Shakespeare,"And rail upon the hostess of the house,"
Shakespeare,"And say you would present her at the leet,"
Shakespeare,Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
Shakespeare,Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
Shakespeare,"Ay, the woman's maid of the house."
Shakespeare,"Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,"
Shakespeare,"Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,"
Shakespeare,As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
Shakespeare,And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
Shakespeare,And twenty more such names and men as these
Shakespeare,Which never were nor no man ever saw.
Shakespeare,Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!
Shakespeare,I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.
Shakespeare,"Enter the Page as a lady, with attendants"
Shakespeare,How fares my noble lord?
Shakespeare,"Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough."
Shakespeare,Where is my wife?
Shakespeare,"Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?"
Shakespeare,Are you my wife and will not call me husband?
Shakespeare,My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.
Shakespeare,"My husband and my lord, my lord and husband,"
Shakespeare,I am your wife in all obedience.
Shakespeare,I know it well. What must I call her?
Shakespeare,Madam.
Shakespeare,"Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?"
Shakespeare,"'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords"
Shakespeare,call ladies.
Shakespeare,"Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd"
Shakespeare,And slept above some fifteen year or more.
Shakespeare,"Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,"
Shakespeare,Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.
Shakespeare,"'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone."
Shakespeare,"Madam, undress you and come now to bed."
Shakespeare,"Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you"
Shakespeare,"To pardon me yet for a night or two,"
Shakespeare,"Or, if not so, until the sun be set:"
Shakespeare,"For your physicians have expressly charged,"
Shakespeare,"In peril to incur your former malady,"
Shakespeare,That I should yet absent me from your bed:
Shakespeare,I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
Shakespeare,"Ay, it stands so that I may hardly"
Shakespeare,tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into
Shakespeare,my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in
Shakespeare,despite of the flesh and the blood.
Shakespeare,"Your honour's players, heating your amendment,"
Shakespeare,"Are come to play a pleasant comedy,"
Shakespeare,"For so your doctors hold it very meet,"
Shakespeare,"Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,"
Shakespeare,And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
Shakespeare,Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
Shakespeare,"And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,"
Shakespeare,Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
Shakespeare,"Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a"
Shakespeare,comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?
Shakespeare,"No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff."
Shakespeare,"What, household stuff?"
Shakespeare,It is a kind of history.
Shakespeare,"Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side"
Shakespeare,and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Padua. A public place.
Shakespeare,Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO
Shakespeare,"Tranio, since for the great desire I had"
Shakespeare,"To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,"
Shakespeare,"I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,"
Shakespeare,"The pleasant garden of great Italy,"
Shakespeare,And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
Shakespeare,"With his good will and thy good company,"
Shakespeare,"My trusty servant, well approved in all,"
Shakespeare,Here let us breathe and haply institute
Shakespeare,A course of learning and ingenious studies.
Shakespeare,Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
Shakespeare,"Gave me my being and my father first,"
Shakespeare,"A merchant of great traffic through the world,"
Shakespeare,Vincetino come of Bentivolii.
Shakespeare,Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
Shakespeare,"It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,"
Shakespeare,To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
Shakespeare,"And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,"
Shakespeare,Virtue and that part of philosophy
Shakespeare,Will I apply that treats of happiness
Shakespeare,By virtue specially to be achieved.
Shakespeare,"Tell me thy mind, for I have Pisa left"
Shakespeare,"And am to Padua come, as he that leaves"
Shakespeare,A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
Shakespeare,And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
Shakespeare,"Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,"
Shakespeare,"I am in all affected as yourself,"
Shakespeare,Glad that you thus continue your resolve
Shakespeare,To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
Shakespeare,"Only, good master, while we do admire"
Shakespeare,"This virtue and this moral discipline,"
Shakespeare,"Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray,"
Shakespeare,Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
Shakespeare,As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
Shakespeare,Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
Shakespeare,"And practise rhetoric in your common talk,"
Shakespeare,"Music and poesy use to quicken you,"
Shakespeare,"The mathematics and the metaphysics,"
Shakespeare,"Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you,"
Shakespeare,No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
Shakespeare,"In brief, sir, study what you most affect."
Shakespeare,"Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise."
Shakespeare,"If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,"
Shakespeare,"We could at once put us in readiness,"
Shakespeare,And take a lodging fit to entertain
Shakespeare,Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
Shakespeare,But stay a while: what company is this?
Shakespeare,"Master, some show to welcome us to town."
Shakespeare,"Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by"
Shakespeare,"Gentlemen, importune me no farther,"
Shakespeare,"For how I firmly am resolved you know,"
Shakespeare,"That is, not bestow my youngest daughter"
Shakespeare,Before I have a husband for the elder:
Shakespeare,"If either of you both love Katharina,"
Shakespeare,"Because I know you well and love you well,"
Shakespeare,Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
Shakespeare,[Aside]  To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.
Shakespeare,"There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife?"
Shakespeare,"I pray you, sir, is it your will"
Shakespeare,To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
Shakespeare,"Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,"
Shakespeare,"Unless you were of gentler, milder mould."
Shakespeare,"I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:"
Shakespeare,"I wis it is not half way to her heart,"
Shakespeare,"But if it were, doubt not her care should be"
Shakespeare,To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
Shakespeare,And paint your face and use you like a fool.
Shakespeare,"From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!"
Shakespeare,"And me too, good Lord!"
Shakespeare,"Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:"
Shakespeare,That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
Shakespeare,But in the other's silence do I see
Shakespeare,Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.
Shakespeare,"Peace, Tranio!"
Shakespeare,"Well said, master, mum! and gaze your fill."
Shakespeare,"Gentlemen, that I may soon make good"
Shakespeare,"What I have said, Bianca, get you in:"
Shakespeare,"And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,"
Shakespeare,"For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl."
Shakespeare,A pretty peat! it is best
Shakespeare,"Put finger in the eye, an she knew why."
Shakespeare,"Sister, content you in my discontent."
Shakespeare,"Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:"
Shakespeare,"My books and instruments shall be my company,"
Shakespeare,On them to took and practise by myself.
Shakespeare,"Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak."
Shakespeare,"Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?"
Shakespeare,Sorry am I that our good will effects
Shakespeare,Bianca's grief.
Shakespeare,"Why will you mew her up,"
Shakespeare,"Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,"
Shakespeare,And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
Shakespeare,"Gentlemen, content ye, I am resolved:"
Shakespeare,"Go in, Bianca:"
Shakespeare,Exit BIANCA
Shakespeare,Exit BIANCA
Shakespeare,And for I know she taketh most delight
Shakespeare,"In music, instruments and poetry,"
Shakespeare,"Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,"
Shakespeare,"Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,"
Shakespeare,"Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,"
Shakespeare,"Prefer them hither, for to cunning men"
Shakespeare,"I will be very kind, and liberal"
Shakespeare,To mine own children in good bringing up:
Shakespeare,"And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay,"
Shakespeare,For I have more to commune with Bianca.
Shakespeare,"Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,"
Shakespeare,"shall I be appointed hours, as though, belike, I"
Shakespeare,"knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?"
Shakespeare,You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
Shakespeare,"good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not"
Shakespeare,"so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails"
Shakespeare,"together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on"
Shakespeare,both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
Shakespeare,"sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit"
Shakespeare,"man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will"
Shakespeare,wish him to her father.
Shakespeare,"So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray."
Shakespeare,Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
Shakespeare,"parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,"
Shakespeare,that we may yet again have access to our fair
Shakespeare,"mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to"
Shakespeare,labour and effect one thing specially.
Shakespeare,"What's that, I pray?"
Shakespeare,"Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister."
Shakespeare,A husband! a devil.
Shakespeare,"I say, a husband."
Shakespeare,"I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though"
Shakespeare,"her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool"
Shakespeare,to be married to hell?
Shakespeare,"Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine"
Shakespeare,"to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good"
Shakespeare,"fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,"
Shakespeare,"would take her with all faults, and money enough."
Shakespeare,"I cannot tell, but I had as lief take her dowry with"
Shakespeare,"this condition, to be whipped at the high cross"
Shakespeare,every morning.
Shakespeare,"Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten"
Shakespeare,"apples. But come, since this bar in law makes us"
Shakespeare,"friends, it shall be so far forth friendly"
Shakespeare,maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
Shakespeare,"to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,"
Shakespeare,and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
Shakespeare,be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.
Shakespeare,"How say you, Signior Gremio?"
Shakespeare,"I am agreed, and would I had given him the best"
Shakespeare,horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
Shakespeare,"thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the"
Shakespeare,house of her! Come on.
Shakespeare,Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO
Shakespeare,"I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible"
Shakespeare,That love should of a sudden take such hold?
Shakespeare,"O Tranio, till I found it to be true,"
Shakespeare,"I never thought it possible or likely,"
Shakespeare,"But see, while idly I stood looking on,"
Shakespeare,I found the effect of love in idleness:
Shakespeare,"And now in plainness do confess to thee,"
Shakespeare,That art to me as secret and as dear
Shakespeare,"As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,"
Shakespeare,"Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,"
Shakespeare,If I achieve not this young modest girl.
Shakespeare,"Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst,"
Shakespeare,"Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt."
Shakespeare,"Master, it is no time to chide you now,"
Shakespeare,Affection is not rated from the heart:
Shakespeare,"If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,"
Shakespeare,'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
Shakespeare,"Gramercies, lad, go forward, this contents:"
Shakespeare,"The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound."
Shakespeare,"Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,"
Shakespeare,Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
Shakespeare,"O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,"
Shakespeare,"Such as the daughter of Agenor had,"
Shakespeare,That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.
Shakespeare,When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
Shakespeare,Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
Shakespeare,Began to scold and raise up such a storm
Shakespeare,That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
Shakespeare,"Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move"
Shakespeare,And with her breath she did perfume the air:
Shakespeare,Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
Shakespeare,"Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance."
Shakespeare,"I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,"
Shakespeare,Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
Shakespeare,Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
Shakespeare,"That till the father rid his hands of her,"
Shakespeare,"Master, your love must live a maid at home,"
Shakespeare,"And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,"
Shakespeare,Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
Shakespeare,"Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!"
Shakespeare,"But art thou not advised, he took some care"
Shakespeare,To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
Shakespeare,"Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now 'tis plotted."
Shakespeare,"I have it, Tranio."
Shakespeare,"Master, for my hand,"
Shakespeare,Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
Shakespeare,Tell me thine first.
Shakespeare,You will be schoolmaster
Shakespeare,And undertake the teaching of the maid:
Shakespeare,That's your device.
Shakespeare,It is: may it be done?
Shakespeare,"Not possible, for who shall bear your part,"
Shakespeare,"And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,"
Shakespeare,"Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,"
Shakespeare,Visit his countrymen and banquet them?
Shakespeare,"Basta, content thee, for I have it full."
Shakespeare,"We have not yet been seen in any house,"
Shakespeare,Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
Shakespeare,"For man or master, then it follows thus,"
Shakespeare,"Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,"
Shakespeare,Keep house and port and servants as I should:
Shakespeare,"I will some other be, some Florentine,"
Shakespeare,"Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa."
Shakespeare,"'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once"
Shakespeare,"Uncase thee, take my colour'd hat and cloak:"
Shakespeare,"When Biondello comes, he waits on thee,"
Shakespeare,But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
Shakespeare,So had you need.
Shakespeare,"In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,"
Shakespeare,"And I am tied to be obedient,"
Shakespeare,"For so your father charged me at our parting,"
Shakespeare,"'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,"
Shakespeare,"Although I think 'twas in another sense,"
Shakespeare,"I am content to be Lucentio,"
Shakespeare,Because so well I love Lucentio.
Shakespeare,"Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:"
Shakespeare,"And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid"
Shakespeare,Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
Shakespeare,Here comes the rogue.
Shakespeare,Enter BIONDELLO
Shakespeare,Enter BIONDELLO
Shakespeare,Enter BIONDELLO
Shakespeare,Enter BIONDELLO
Shakespeare,"Sirrah, where have you been?"
Shakespeare,"Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?"
Shakespeare,"Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or"
Shakespeare,"you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?"
Shakespeare,"Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,"
Shakespeare,And therefore frame your manners to the time.
Shakespeare,"Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,"
Shakespeare,"Puts my apparel and my countenance on,"
Shakespeare,"And I for my escape have put on his,"
Shakespeare,For in a quarrel since I came ashore
Shakespeare,I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
Shakespeare,"Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,"
Shakespeare,While I make way from hence to save my life:
Shakespeare,You understand me?
Shakespeare,"I, sir! ne'er a whit."
Shakespeare,And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
Shakespeare,Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
Shakespeare,The better for him: would I were so too!
Shakespeare,"So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,"
Shakespeare,That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
Shakespeare,"But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise"
Shakespeare,You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
Shakespeare,"When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio,"
Shakespeare,But in all places else your master Lucentio.
Shakespeare,"Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that"
Shakespeare,"thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if"
Shakespeare,"thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good"
Shakespeare,and weighty.
Shakespeare,The presenters above speak
Shakespeare,"My lord, you nod, you do not mind the play."
Shakespeare,"Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:"
Shakespeare,comes there any more of it?
Shakespeare,"My lord, 'tis but begun."
Shakespeare,"'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:"
Shakespeare,would 'twere done!
Shakespeare,They sit and mark
Shakespeare,SCENE II. Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house.
Shakespeare,Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO
Shakespeare,"Verona, for a while I take my leave,"
Shakespeare,"To see my friends in Padua, but of all"
Shakespeare,"My best beloved and approved friend,"
Shakespeare,"Hortensio, and I trow this is his house."
Shakespeare,"Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say."
Shakespeare,"Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has"
Shakespeare,rebused your worship?
Shakespeare,"Villain, I say, knock me here soundly."
Shakespeare,"Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that"
Shakespeare,"I should knock you here, sir?"
Shakespeare,"Villain, I say, knock me at this gate"
Shakespeare,"And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate."
Shakespeare,My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
Shakespeare,"you first,"
Shakespeare,And then I know after who comes by the worst.
Shakespeare,Will it not be?
Shakespeare,"Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it,"
Shakespeare,"I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it."
Shakespeare,He wrings him by the ears
Shakespeare,"Help, masters, help! my master is mad."
Shakespeare,"Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!"
Shakespeare,Enter HORTENSIO
Shakespeare,How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
Shakespeare,and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
Shakespeare,"Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?"
Shakespeare,"'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say."
Shakespeare,"'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor"
Shakespeare,"mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound"
Shakespeare,this quarrel.
Shakespeare,"Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin."
Shakespeare,if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
Shakespeare,"service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap"
Shakespeare,"him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to"
Shakespeare,"use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,"
Shakespeare,"two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had"
Shakespeare,"well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst."
Shakespeare,"A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,"
Shakespeare,I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
Shakespeare,And could not get him for my heart to do it.
Shakespeare,Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
Shakespeare,"words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,"
Shakespeare,"knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you"
Shakespeare,"now with, 'knocking at the gate'?"
Shakespeare,"Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you."
Shakespeare,"Petruchio, patience, I am Grumio's pledge:"
Shakespeare,"Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,"
Shakespeare,"Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio."
Shakespeare,"And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale"
Shakespeare,Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
Shakespeare,"Such wind as scatters young men through the world,"
Shakespeare,To seek their fortunes farther than at home
Shakespeare,"Where small experience grows. But in a few,"
Shakespeare,"Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:"
Shakespeare,"Antonio, my father, is deceased,"
Shakespeare,"And I have thrust myself into this maze,"
Shakespeare,Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
Shakespeare,"Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,"
Shakespeare,And so am come abroad to see the world.
Shakespeare,"Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee"
Shakespeare,And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Shakespeare,Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
Shakespeare,And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
Shakespeare,"And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,"
Shakespeare,And I'll not wish thee to her.
Shakespeare,"Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we"
Shakespeare,"Few words suffice, and therefore, if thou know"
Shakespeare,"One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,"
Shakespeare,"As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,"
Shakespeare,"Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,"
Shakespeare,As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
Shakespeare,"As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,"
Shakespeare,"She moves me not, or not removes, at least,"
Shakespeare,"Affection's edge in me, were she as rough"
Shakespeare,As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
Shakespeare,"I come to wive it wealthily in Padua,"
Shakespeare,"If wealthily, then happily in Padua."
Shakespeare,"Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his"
Shakespeare,mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
Shakespeare,"a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne'er"
Shakespeare,"a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases"
Shakespeare,"as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,"
Shakespeare,so money comes withal.
Shakespeare,"Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,"
Shakespeare,I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
Shakespeare,"I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife"
Shakespeare,"With wealth enough and young and beauteous,"
Shakespeare,Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
Shakespeare,"Her only fault, and that is faults enough,"
Shakespeare,Is that she is intolerable curst
Shakespeare,"And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure"
Shakespeare,"That, were my state far worser than it is,"
Shakespeare,I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
Shakespeare,"Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:"
Shakespeare,"Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough,"
Shakespeare,"For I will board her, though she chide as loud"
Shakespeare,As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
Shakespeare,"Her father is Baptista Minola,"
Shakespeare,An affable and courteous gentleman:
Shakespeare,"Her name is Katharina Minola,"
Shakespeare,Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
Shakespeare,"I know her father, though I know not her,"
Shakespeare,And he knew my deceased father well.
Shakespeare,"I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her,"
Shakespeare,And therefore let me be thus bold with you
Shakespeare,"To give you over at this first encounter,"
Shakespeare,Unless you will accompany me thither.
Shakespeare,"I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts."
Shakespeare,"O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she"
Shakespeare,would think scolding would do little good upon him:
Shakespeare,she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
Shakespeare,"why, that's nothing, an he begin once, he'll rail in"
Shakespeare,"his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she"
Shakespeare,"stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in"
Shakespeare,her face and so disfigure her with it that she
Shakespeare,shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
Shakespeare,"You know him not, sir."
Shakespeare,"Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,"
Shakespeare,For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
Shakespeare,"He hath the jewel of my life in hold,"
Shakespeare,"His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,"
Shakespeare,"And her withholds from me and other more,"
Shakespeare,"Suitors to her and rivals in my love,"
Shakespeare,"Supposing it a thing impossible,"
Shakespeare,"For those defects I have before rehearsed,"
Shakespeare,"That ever Katharina will be woo'd,"
Shakespeare,"Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,"
Shakespeare,That none shall have access unto Bianca
Shakespeare,Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.
Shakespeare,Katharina the curst!
Shakespeare,A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
Shakespeare,"Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,"
Shakespeare,And offer me disguised in sober robes
Shakespeare,To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Shakespeare,"Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca,"
Shakespeare,"That so I may, by this device, at least"
Shakespeare,Have leave and leisure to make love to her
Shakespeare,And unsuspected court her by herself.
Shakespeare,"Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,"
Shakespeare,how the young folks lay their heads together!
Shakespeare,"Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised"
Shakespeare,"Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?"
Shakespeare,"Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love."
Shakespeare,"Petruchio, stand by a while."
Shakespeare,A proper stripling and an amorous!
Shakespeare,"O, very well, I have perused the note."
Shakespeare,"Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:"
Shakespeare,"All books of love, see that at any hand,"
Shakespeare,And see you read no other lectures to her:
Shakespeare,You understand me: over and beside
Shakespeare,"Signior Baptista's liberality,"
Shakespeare,"I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,"
Shakespeare,And let me have them very well perfumed
Shakespeare,For she is sweeter than perfume itself
Shakespeare,To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
Shakespeare,"Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you"
Shakespeare,"As for my patron, stand you so assured,"
Shakespeare,As firmly as yourself were still in place:
Shakespeare,"Yea, and perhaps with more successful words"
Shakespeare,"Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir."
Shakespeare,"O this learning, what a thing it is!"
Shakespeare,"O this woodcock, what an ass it is!"
Shakespeare,"Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio."
Shakespeare,"And you are well met, Signior Hortensio."
Shakespeare,Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
Shakespeare,I promised to inquire carefully
Shakespeare,About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
Shakespeare,And by good fortune I have lighted well
Shakespeare,"On this young man, for learning and behavior"
Shakespeare,"Fit for her turn, well read in poetry"
Shakespeare,"And other books, good ones, I warrant ye."
Shakespeare,"'Tis well, and I have met a gentleman"
Shakespeare,"Hath promised me to help me to another,"
Shakespeare,"A fine musician to instruct our mistress,"
Shakespeare,So shall I no whit be behind in duty
Shakespeare,"To fair Bianca, so beloved of me."
Shakespeare,"Beloved of me, and that my deeds shall prove."
Shakespeare,And that his bags shall prove.
Shakespeare,"Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:"
Shakespeare,"Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,"
Shakespeare,I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
Shakespeare,"Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,"
Shakespeare,"Upon agreement from us to his liking,"
Shakespeare,"Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,"
Shakespeare,"Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please."
Shakespeare,"So said, so done, is well."
Shakespeare,"Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?"
Shakespeare,I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
Shakespeare,"If that be all, masters, I hear no harm."
Shakespeare,"No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?"
Shakespeare,"Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:"
Shakespeare,"My father dead, my fortune lives for me,"
Shakespeare,And I do hope good days and long to see.
Shakespeare,"O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!"
Shakespeare,"But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:"
Shakespeare,You shall have me assisting you in all.
Shakespeare,But will you woo this wild-cat?
Shakespeare,Will I live?
Shakespeare,"Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her."
Shakespeare,Why came I hither but to that intent?
Shakespeare,Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Shakespeare,Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Shakespeare,Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
Shakespeare,Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Shakespeare,"Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,"
Shakespeare,And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
Shakespeare,Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Shakespeare,"Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?"
Shakespeare,"And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,"
Shakespeare,That gives not half so great a blow to hear
Shakespeare,As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
Shakespeare,"Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs."
Shakespeare,For he fears none.
Shakespeare,"Hortensio, hark:"
Shakespeare,"This gentleman is happily arrived,"
Shakespeare,"My mind presumes, for his own good and ours."
Shakespeare,I promised we would be contributors
Shakespeare,"And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er."
Shakespeare,"And so we will, provided that he win her."
Shakespeare,I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
Shakespeare,"Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO"
Shakespeare,"Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,"
Shakespeare,"Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way"
Shakespeare,To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
Shakespeare,He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?
Shakespeare,"Even he, Biondello."
Shakespeare,"Hark you, sir, you mean not her to--"
Shakespeare,"Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?"
Shakespeare,"Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray."
Shakespeare,"I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away."
Shakespeare,"Well begun, Tranio."
Shakespeare,"Sir, a word ere you go,"
Shakespeare,"Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?"
Shakespeare,"And if I be, sir, is it any offence?"
Shakespeare,"No, if without more words you will get you hence."
Shakespeare,"Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free"
Shakespeare,For me as for you?
Shakespeare,But so is not she.
Shakespeare,"For what reason, I beseech you?"
Shakespeare,"For this reason, if you'll know,"
Shakespeare,That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
Shakespeare,That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
Shakespeare,"Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,"
Shakespeare,"Do me this right, hear me with patience."
Shakespeare,"Baptista is a noble gentleman,"
Shakespeare,"To whom my father is not all unknown,"
Shakespeare,"And were his daughter fairer than she is,"
Shakespeare,She may more suitors have and me for one.
Shakespeare,"Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers,"
Shakespeare,Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
Shakespeare,"And so she shall, Lucentio shall make one,"
Shakespeare,Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
Shakespeare,What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.
Shakespeare,"Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade."
Shakespeare,"Hortensio, to what end are all these words?"
Shakespeare,"Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,"
Shakespeare,Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
Shakespeare,"No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two,"
Shakespeare,The one as famous for a scolding tongue
Shakespeare,As is the other for beauteous modesty.
Shakespeare,"Sir, sir, the first's for me, let her go by."
Shakespeare,"Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,"
Shakespeare,And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
Shakespeare,"Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:"
Shakespeare,The younges t daughter whom you hearken for
Shakespeare,"Her father keeps from all access of suitors,"
Shakespeare,And will not promise her to any man
Shakespeare,Until the elder sister first be wed:
Shakespeare,The younger then is free and not before.
Shakespeare,"If it be so, sir, that you are the man"
Shakespeare,"Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,"
Shakespeare,"And if you break the ice and do this feat,"
Shakespeare,"Achieve the elder, set the younger free"
Shakespeare,"For our access, whose hap shall be to have her"
Shakespeare,Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
Shakespeare,"Sir, you say well and well you do conceive,"
Shakespeare,"And since you do profess to be a suitor,"
Shakespeare,"You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,"
Shakespeare,To whom we all rest generally beholding.
Shakespeare,"Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,"
Shakespeare,"Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,"
Shakespeare,"And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,"
Shakespeare,"And do as adversaries do in law,"
Shakespeare,"Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends."
Shakespeare,"O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone."
Shakespeare,"The motion's good indeed and be it so,"
Shakespeare,"Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Padua. A room in BAPTISTA'S house.
Shakespeare,Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA
Shakespeare,"Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,"
Shakespeare,"To make a bondmaid and a slave of me,"
Shakespeare,"That I disdain: but for these other gawds,"
Shakespeare,"Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,"
Shakespeare,"Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat,"
Shakespeare,"Or what you will command me will I do,"
Shakespeare,So well I know my duty to my elders.
Shakespeare,"Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell"
Shakespeare,Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
Shakespeare,"Believe me, sister, of all the men alive"
Shakespeare,I never yet beheld that special face
Shakespeare,Which I could fancy more than any other.
Shakespeare,"Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?"
Shakespeare,"If you affect him, sister, here I swear"
Shakespeare,"I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have"
Shakespeare,"O then, belike, you fancy riches more:"
Shakespeare,You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
Shakespeare,Is it for him you do envy me so?
Shakespeare,"Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive"
Shakespeare,You have but jested with me all this while:
Shakespeare,"I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands."
Shakespeare,"If that be jest, then all the rest was so."
Shakespeare,Strikes her
Shakespeare,Enter BAPTISTA
Shakespeare,"Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?"
Shakespeare,"Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps."
Shakespeare,"Go ply thy needle, meddle not with her."
Shakespeare,"For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,"
Shakespeare,Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
Shakespeare,When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
Shakespeare,"Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged."
Shakespeare,Flies after BIANCA
Shakespeare,"What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in."
Shakespeare,"What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see"
Shakespeare,"She is your treasure, she must have a husband,"
Shakespeare,I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
Shakespeare,And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
Shakespeare,Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
Shakespeare,Till I can find occasion of revenge.
Shakespeare,Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
Shakespeare,"Enter GREMIO, LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man,  PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician, and TRANIO, with BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books"
Shakespeare,"Good morrow, neighbour Baptista."
Shakespeare,"Good morrow, neighbour Gremio."
Shakespeare,"God save you, gentlemen!"
Shakespeare,"And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter"
Shakespeare,"Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?"
Shakespeare,"I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina."
Shakespeare,You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
Shakespeare,"You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave."
Shakespeare,"I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,"
Shakespeare,"That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,"
Shakespeare,"Her affability and bashful modesty,"
Shakespeare,"Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,"
Shakespeare,Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Shakespeare,"Within your house, to make mine eye the witness"
Shakespeare,Of that report which I so oft have heard.
Shakespeare,"And, for an entrance to my entertainment,"
Shakespeare,"I do present you with a man of mine,"
Shakespeare,Presenting HORTENSIO
Shakespeare,"Cunning in music and the mathematics,"
Shakespeare,"To instruct her fully in those sciences,"
Shakespeare,Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
Shakespeare,"Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:"
Shakespeare,"His name is Licio, born in Mantua."
Shakespeare,"You're welcome, sir, and he, for your good sake."
Shakespeare,"But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,"
Shakespeare,"She is not for your turn, the more my grief."
Shakespeare,"I see you do not mean to part with her,"
Shakespeare,Or else you like not of my company.
Shakespeare,"Mistake me not, I speak but as I find."
Shakespeare,"Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?"
Shakespeare,"Petruchio is my name, Antonio's son,"
Shakespeare,A man well known throughout all Italy.
Shakespeare,I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
Shakespeare,"Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,"
Shakespeare,"Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:"
Shakespeare,Baccare! you are marvellous forward.
Shakespeare,"O, pardon me, Signior Gremio, I would fain be doing."
Shakespeare,"I doubt it not, sir, but you will curse your"
Shakespeare,"wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am"
Shakespeare,"sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,"
Shakespeare,that have been more kindly beholding to you than
Shakespeare,"any, freely give unto you this young scholar,"
Shakespeare,Presenting LUCENTIO
Shakespeare,"that hath been long studying at Rheims, as cunning"
Shakespeare,"in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other"
Shakespeare,"in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio, pray,"
Shakespeare,accept his service.
Shakespeare,"A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio."
Shakespeare,"Welcome, good Cambio."
Shakespeare,To TRANIO
Shakespeare,"But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:"
Shakespeare,may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
Shakespeare,"Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,"
Shakespeare,"That, being a stranger in this city here,"
Shakespeare,"Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,"
Shakespeare,"Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous."
Shakespeare,"Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,"
Shakespeare,In the preferment of the eldest sister.
Shakespeare,"This liberty is all that I request,"
Shakespeare,"That, upon knowledge of my parentage,"
Shakespeare,I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
Shakespeare,And free access and favour as the rest:
Shakespeare,"And, toward the education of your daughters,"
Shakespeare,"I here bestow a simple instrument,"
Shakespeare,And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
Shakespeare,"If you accept them, then their worth is great."
Shakespeare,"Lucentio is your name, of whence, I pray?"
Shakespeare,"Of Pisa, sir, son to Vincentio."
Shakespeare,"A mighty man of Pisa, by report"
Shakespeare,"I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,"
Shakespeare,"Take you the lute, and you the set of books,"
Shakespeare,You shall go see your pupils presently.
Shakespeare,"Holla, within!"
Shakespeare,"Sirrah, lead these gentlemen"
Shakespeare,"To my daughters, and tell them both,"
Shakespeare,These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
Shakespeare,"Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO, BIONDELLO following"
Shakespeare,"We will go walk a little in the orchard,"
Shakespeare,"And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,"
Shakespeare,And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
Shakespeare,"Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,"
Shakespeare,And every day I cannot come to woo.
Shakespeare,"You knew my father well, and in him me,"
Shakespeare,"Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,"
Shakespeare,Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
Shakespeare,"Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,"
Shakespeare,What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
Shakespeare,"After my death the one half of my lands,"
Shakespeare,And in possession twenty thousand crowns.
Shakespeare,"And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of"
Shakespeare,"Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,"
Shakespeare,In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
Shakespeare,"Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,"
Shakespeare,That covenants may be kept on either hand.
Shakespeare,"Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,"
Shakespeare,"That is, her love, for that is all in all."
Shakespeare,"Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,"
Shakespeare,"I am as peremptory as she proud-minded,"
Shakespeare,And where two raging fires meet together
Shakespeare,They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
Shakespeare,"Though little fire grows great with little wind,"
Shakespeare,Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
Shakespeare,"So I to her and so she yields to me,"
Shakespeare,For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
Shakespeare,"Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!"
Shakespeare,But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
Shakespeare,"Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,"
Shakespeare,"That shake not, though they blow perpetually."
Shakespeare,"Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke"
Shakespeare,"How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?"
Shakespeare,"For fear, I promise you, if I look pale."
Shakespeare,"What, will my daughter prove a good musician?"
Shakespeare,I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
Shakespeare,"Iron may hold with her, but never lutes."
Shakespeare,"Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?"
Shakespeare,"Why, no, for she hath broke the lute to me."
Shakespeare,"I did but tell her she mistook her frets,"
Shakespeare,"And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,"
Shakespeare,"When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,"
Shakespeare,"'Frets, call you these?' quoth she, 'I'll fume"
Shakespeare,with them:'
Shakespeare,"And, with that word, she struck me on the head,"
Shakespeare,"And through the instrument my pate made way,"
Shakespeare,"And there I stood amazed for a while,"
Shakespeare,"As on a pillory, looking through the lute,"
Shakespeare,While she did call me rascal fiddler
Shakespeare,"And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,"
Shakespeare,As had she studied to misuse me so.
Shakespeare,"Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench,"
Shakespeare,I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
Shakespeare,"O, how I long to have some chat with her!"
Shakespeare,"Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:"
Shakespeare,"Proceed in practise with my younger daughter,"
Shakespeare,She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Shakespeare,"Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,"
Shakespeare,Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
Shakespeare,I pray you do.
Shakespeare,Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
Shakespeare,"I will attend her here,"
Shakespeare,And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Shakespeare,"Say that she rail, why then I'll tell her plain"
Shakespeare,She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
Shakespeare,"Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear"
Shakespeare,As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
Shakespeare,"Say she be mute and will not speak a word,"
Shakespeare,"Then I'll commend her volubility,"
Shakespeare,And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
Shakespeare,"If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,"
Shakespeare,As though she bid me stay by her a week:
Shakespeare,"If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day"
Shakespeare,When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
Shakespeare,"But here she comes, and now, Petruchio, speak."
Shakespeare,Enter KATHARINA
Shakespeare,"Good morrow, Kate, for that's your name, I hear."
Shakespeare,"Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:"
Shakespeare,They call me Katharina that do talk of me.
Shakespeare,"You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,"
Shakespeare,"And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst,"
Shakespeare,"But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom"
Shakespeare,"Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,"
Shakespeare,"For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,"
Shakespeare,"Take this of me, Kate of my consolation,"
Shakespeare,"Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,"
Shakespeare,"Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,"
Shakespeare,"Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,"
Shakespeare,Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
Shakespeare,Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
Shakespeare,Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
Shakespeare,You were a moveable.
Shakespeare,"Why, what's a moveable?"
Shakespeare,A join'd-stool.
Shakespeare,"Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me."
Shakespeare,"Asses are made to bear, and so are you."
Shakespeare,"Women are made to bear, and so are you."
Shakespeare,"No such jade as you, if me you mean."
Shakespeare,"Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee,"
Shakespeare,"For, knowing thee to be but young and light--"
Shakespeare,"Too light for such a swain as you to catch,"
Shakespeare,And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
Shakespeare,Should be! should--buzz!
Shakespeare,"Well ta'en, and like a buzzard."
Shakespeare,O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?
Shakespeare,"Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard."
Shakespeare,"Come, come, you wasp, i' faith, you are too angry."
Shakespeare,"If I be waspish, best beware my sting."
Shakespeare,"My remedy is then, to pluck it out."
Shakespeare,"Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,"
Shakespeare,Who knows not where a wasp does
Shakespeare,wear his sting? In his tail.
Shakespeare,In his tongue.
Shakespeare,Whose tongue?
Shakespeare,"Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell."
Shakespeare,"What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,"
Shakespeare,"Good Kate, I am a gentleman."
Shakespeare,That I'll try.
Shakespeare,She strikes him
Shakespeare,"I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again."
Shakespeare,So may you lose your arms:
Shakespeare,"If you strike me, you are no gentleman,"
Shakespeare,"And if no gentleman, why then no arms."
Shakespeare,"A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!"
Shakespeare,What is your crest? a coxcomb?
Shakespeare,"A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen."
Shakespeare,"No cock of mine, you crow too like a craven."
Shakespeare,"Nay, come, Kate, come, you must not look so sour."
Shakespeare,"It is my fashion, when I see a crab."
Shakespeare,"Why, here's no crab, and therefore look not sour."
Shakespeare,"There is, there is."
Shakespeare,Then show it me.
Shakespeare,"Had I a glass, I would."
Shakespeare,"What, you mean my face?"
Shakespeare,Well aim'd of such a young one.
Shakespeare,"Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you."
Shakespeare,Yet you are wither'd.
Shakespeare,'Tis with cares.
Shakespeare,"Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so."
Shakespeare,"I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go."
Shakespeare,"No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle."
Shakespeare,"'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,"
Shakespeare,"And now I find report a very liar,"
Shakespeare,"For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,"
Shakespeare,"But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:"
Shakespeare,"Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,"
Shakespeare,"Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,"
Shakespeare,"Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,"
Shakespeare,"But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,"
Shakespeare,"With gentle conference, soft and affable."
Shakespeare,Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
Shakespeare,O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Shakespeare,Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
Shakespeare,As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
Shakespeare,"O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt."
Shakespeare,"Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command."
Shakespeare,Did ever Dian so become a grove
Shakespeare,As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
Shakespeare,"O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate,"
Shakespeare,And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!
Shakespeare,Where did you study all this goodly speech?
Shakespeare,"It is extempore, from my mother-wit."
Shakespeare,A witty mother! witless else her son.
Shakespeare,Am I not wise?
Shakespeare,"Yes, keep you warm."
Shakespeare,"Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:"
Shakespeare,"And therefore, setting all this chat aside,"
Shakespeare,Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
Shakespeare,"That you shall be my wife, your dowry 'greed on,"
Shakespeare,"And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you."
Shakespeare,"Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn,"
Shakespeare,"For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,"
Shakespeare,"Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,"
Shakespeare,"Thou must be married to no man but me,"
Shakespeare,"For I am he am born to tame you Kate,"
Shakespeare,And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Shakespeare,Conformable as other household Kates.
Shakespeare,"Here comes your father: never make denial,"
Shakespeare,I must and will have Katharina to my wife.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO"
Shakespeare,"Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?"
Shakespeare,"How but well, sir? how but well?"
Shakespeare,It were impossible I should speed amiss.
Shakespeare,"Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?"
Shakespeare,"Call you me daughter? now, I promise you"
Shakespeare,"You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,"
Shakespeare,"To wish me wed to one half lunatic,"
Shakespeare,"A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,"
Shakespeare,That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
Shakespeare,"Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,"
Shakespeare,"That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:"
Shakespeare,"If she be curst, it is for policy,"
Shakespeare,"For she's not froward, but modest as the dove,"
Shakespeare,"She is not hot, but temperate as the morn,"
Shakespeare,"For patience she will prove a second Grissel,"
Shakespeare,And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
Shakespeare,"And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,"
Shakespeare,That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
Shakespeare,I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
Shakespeare,"Hark, Petruchio, she says she'll see thee"
Shakespeare,hang'd first.
Shakespeare,"Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!"
Shakespeare,"Be patient, gentlemen, I choose her for myself:"
Shakespeare,"If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?"
Shakespeare,"'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,"
Shakespeare,That she shall still be curst in company.
Shakespeare,"I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe"
Shakespeare,"How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!"
Shakespeare,"She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss"
Shakespeare,"She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,"
Shakespeare,That in a twink she won me to her love.
Shakespeare,"O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,"
Shakespeare,"How tame, when men and women are alone,"
Shakespeare,A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Shakespeare,"Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,"
Shakespeare,To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Shakespeare,"Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests,"
Shakespeare,I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.
Shakespeare,"I know not what to say: but give me your hands,"
Shakespeare,"God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match."
Shakespeare,"Amen, say we: we will be witnesses."
Shakespeare,"Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu,"
Shakespeare,"I will to Venice, Sunday comes apace:"
Shakespeare,"We will have rings and things and fine array,"
Shakespeare,"And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday."
Shakespeare,Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally
Shakespeare,Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
Shakespeare,"Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,"
Shakespeare,And venture madly on a desperate mart.
Shakespeare,'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
Shakespeare,"'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas."
Shakespeare,"The gain I seek is, quiet in the match."
Shakespeare,No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
Shakespeare,"But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:"
Shakespeare,Now is the day we long have looked for:
Shakespeare,"I am your neighbour, and was suitor first."
Shakespeare,And I am one that love Bianca more
Shakespeare,"Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess."
Shakespeare,"Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I."
Shakespeare,"Graybeard, thy love doth freeze."
Shakespeare,But thine doth fry.
Shakespeare,"Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth."
Shakespeare,But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
Shakespeare,"Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:"
Shakespeare,"'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both"
Shakespeare,That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shakespeare,Shall have my Bianca's love.
Shakespeare,"Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?"
Shakespeare,"First, as you know, my house within the city"
Shakespeare,"Is richly furnished with plate and gold,"
Shakespeare,"Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands,"
Shakespeare,"My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry,"
Shakespeare,"In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns,"
Shakespeare,"In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,"
Shakespeare,"Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,"
Shakespeare,"Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,"
Shakespeare,"Valance of Venice gold in needlework,"
Shakespeare,Pewter and brass and all things that belong
Shakespeare,"To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm"
Shakespeare,"I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,"
Shakespeare,"Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,"
Shakespeare,And all things answerable to this portion.
Shakespeare,"Myself am struck in years, I must confess,"
Shakespeare,"And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,"
Shakespeare,If whilst I live she will be only mine.
Shakespeare,"That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:"
Shakespeare,I am my father's heir and only son:
Shakespeare,"If I may have your daughter to my wife,"
Shakespeare,"I'll leave her houses three or four as good,"
Shakespeare,"Within rich Pisa walls, as any one"
Shakespeare,"Old Signior Gremio has in Padua,"
Shakespeare,Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Shakespeare,"Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure."
Shakespeare,"What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?"
Shakespeare,Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
Shakespeare,My land amounts not to so much in all:
Shakespeare,"That she shall have, besides an argosy"
Shakespeare,That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
Shakespeare,"What, have I choked you with an argosy?"
Shakespeare,"Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less"
Shakespeare,"Than three great argosies, besides two galliases,"
Shakespeare,"And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,"
Shakespeare,"And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next."
Shakespeare,"Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more,"
Shakespeare,And she can have no more than all I have:
Shakespeare,"If you like me, she shall have me and mine."
Shakespeare,"Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,"
Shakespeare,By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.
Shakespeare,"I must confess your offer is the best,"
Shakespeare,"And, let your father make her the assurance,"
Shakespeare,"She is your own, else, you must pardon me,"
Shakespeare,"if you should die before him, where's her dower?"
Shakespeare,"That's but a cavil: he is old, I young."
Shakespeare,"And may not young men die, as well as old?"
Shakespeare,"Well, gentlemen,"
Shakespeare,I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
Shakespeare,My daughter Katharina is to be married:
Shakespeare,"Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca"
Shakespeare,"Be bride to you, if you this assurance,"
Shakespeare,"If not, Signior Gremio:"
Shakespeare,"And so, I take my leave, and thank you both."
Shakespeare,"Adieu, good neighbour."
Shakespeare,Exit BAPTISTA
Shakespeare,Now I fear thee not:
Shakespeare,"Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool"
Shakespeare,"To give thee all, and in his waning age"
Shakespeare,"Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!"
Shakespeare,"An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy."
Shakespeare,A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
Shakespeare,Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
Shakespeare,'Tis in my head to do my master good:
Shakespeare,I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
Shakespeare,"Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio,'"
Shakespeare,And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
Shakespeare,"Do get their children, but in this case of wooing,"
Shakespeare,"A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Padua. BAPTISTA'S house.
Shakespeare,"Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA"
Shakespeare,"Fiddler, forbear, you grow too forward, sir:"
Shakespeare,Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
Shakespeare,Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?
Shakespeare,"But, wrangling pedant, this is"
Shakespeare,The patroness of heavenly harmony:
Shakespeare,"Then give me leave to have prerogative,"
Shakespeare,"And when in music we have spent an hour,"
Shakespeare,Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
Shakespeare,"Preposterous ass, that never read so far"
Shakespeare,To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
Shakespeare,Was it not to refresh the mind of man
Shakespeare,After his studies or his usual pain?
Shakespeare,"Then give me leave to read philosophy,"
Shakespeare,"And while I pause, serve in your harmony."
Shakespeare,"Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine."
Shakespeare,"Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,"
Shakespeare,To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
Shakespeare,"I am no breeching scholar in the schools,"
Shakespeare,"I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,"
Shakespeare,But learn my lessons as I please myself.
Shakespeare,"And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:"
Shakespeare,"Take you your instrument, play you the whiles,"
Shakespeare,His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
Shakespeare,You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
Shakespeare,That will be never: tune your instrument.
Shakespeare,Where left we last?
Shakespeare,"Here, madam:"
Shakespeare,"'Hic ibat Simois, hic est Sigeia tellus,"
Shakespeare,Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
Shakespeare,Construe them.
Shakespeare,"'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am"
Shakespeare,"Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,"
Shakespeare,"'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love,"
Shakespeare,"'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes"
Shakespeare,"a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'"
Shakespeare,"bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might"
Shakespeare,beguile the old pantaloon.
Shakespeare,"Madam, my instrument's in tune."
Shakespeare,Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
Shakespeare,"Spit in the hole, man, and tune again."
Shakespeare,Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
Shakespeare,"Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I"
Shakespeare,"trust you not, 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed"
Shakespeare,"he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'"
Shakespeare,despair not.
Shakespeare,"Madam, 'tis now in tune."
Shakespeare,All but the base.
Shakespeare,"The base is right, 'tis the base knave that jars."
Shakespeare,How fiery and forward our pedant is!
Shakespeare,"Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:"
Shakespeare,"Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet."
Shakespeare,"In time I may believe, yet I mistrust."
Shakespeare,"Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides"
Shakespeare,"Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather."
Shakespeare,"I must believe my master, else, I promise you,"
Shakespeare,I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
Shakespeare,"But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:"
Shakespeare,"Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,"
Shakespeare,That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
Shakespeare,"You may go walk, and give me leave a while:"
Shakespeare,My lessons make no music in three parts.
Shakespeare,"Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,"
Shakespeare,"And watch withal, for, but I be deceived,"
Shakespeare,Our fine musician groweth amorous.
Shakespeare,"Madam, before you touch the instrument,"
Shakespeare,"To learn the order of my fingering,"
Shakespeare,"I must begin with rudiments of art,"
Shakespeare,"To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,"
Shakespeare,"More pleasant, pithy and effectual,"
Shakespeare,Than hath been taught by any of my trade:
Shakespeare,"And there it is in writing, fairly drawn."
Shakespeare,"Why, I am past my gamut long ago."
Shakespeare,Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
Shakespeare,"[Reads]  ''Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,"
Shakespeare,"'A re,' to Plead Hortensio's passion,"
Shakespeare,"'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,"
Shakespeare,"'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection:"
Shakespeare,"'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:"
Shakespeare,"'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.'"
Shakespeare,"Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not:"
Shakespeare,"Old fashions please me best, I am not so nice,"
Shakespeare,To change true rules for old inventions.
Shakespeare,"Mistress, your father prays you leave your books"
Shakespeare,And help to dress your sister's chamber up:
Shakespeare,You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
Shakespeare,"Farewell, sweet masters both, I must be gone."
Shakespeare,Exeunt BIANCA and Servant
Shakespeare,"Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay."
Shakespeare,But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
Shakespeare,Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
Shakespeare,"Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble"
Shakespeare,"To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,"
Shakespeare,"Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,"
Shakespeare,Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
Shakespeare,"Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, LUCENTIO, and others, attendants"
Shakespeare,"[To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio, this is the"
Shakespeare,'pointed day.
Shakespeare,"That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,"
Shakespeare,And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
Shakespeare,"What will be said? what mockery will it be,"
Shakespeare,To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
Shakespeare,To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
Shakespeare,What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
Shakespeare,"No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced"
Shakespeare,To give my hand opposed against my heart
Shakespeare,"Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen,"
Shakespeare,Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
Shakespeare,"I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,"
Shakespeare,Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
Shakespeare,"And, to be noted for a merry man,"
Shakespeare,"He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,"
Shakespeare,"Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns,"
Shakespeare,Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
Shakespeare,"Now must the world point at poor Katharina,"
Shakespeare,"And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,"
Shakespeare,If it would please him come and marry her!'
Shakespeare,"Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too."
Shakespeare,"Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,"
Shakespeare,Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
Shakespeare,"Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise,"
Shakespeare,"Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest."
Shakespeare,Would Katharina had never seen him though!
Shakespeare,"Exit weeping, followed by BIANCA and others"
Shakespeare,"Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep,"
Shakespeare,"For such an injury would vex a very saint,"
Shakespeare,Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
Shakespeare,"Master, master! news, old news, and such news as"
Shakespeare,you never heard of!
Shakespeare,Is it new and old too? how may that be?
Shakespeare,"Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?"
Shakespeare,Is he come?
Shakespeare,"Why, no, sir."
Shakespeare,He is coming.
Shakespeare,When will he be here?
Shakespeare,When he stands where I am and sees you there.
Shakespeare,"But say, what to thine old news?"
Shakespeare,"Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old"
Shakespeare,"jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair"
Shakespeare,"of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,"
Shakespeare,"another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the"
Shakespeare,"town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless,"
Shakespeare,with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
Shakespeare,"old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred,"
Shakespeare,"besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose"
Shakespeare,"in the chine, troubled with the lampass, infected"
Shakespeare,"with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with"
Shakespeare,"spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,"
Shakespeare,"stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the"
Shakespeare,"bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten,"
Shakespeare,"near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit"
Shakespeare,"and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being"
Shakespeare,"restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been"
Shakespeare,"often burst and now repaired with knots, one girth"
Shakespeare,"six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,"
Shakespeare,which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
Shakespeare,"in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread."
Shakespeare,Who comes with him?
Shakespeare,"O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned"
Shakespeare,"like the horse, with a linen stock on one leg and a"
Shakespeare,"kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red"
Shakespeare,"and blue list, an old hat and 'the humour of forty"
Shakespeare,"fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a"
Shakespeare,"very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian"
Shakespeare,footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
Shakespeare,"'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion,"
Shakespeare,Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.
Shakespeare,"I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes."
Shakespeare,"Why, sir, he comes not."
Shakespeare,Didst thou not say he comes?
Shakespeare,Who? that Petruchio came?
Shakespeare,"Ay, that Petruchio came."
Shakespeare,"No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back."
Shakespeare,"Why, that's all one."
Shakespeare,"Nay, by Saint Jamy,"
Shakespeare,"I hold you a penny,"
Shakespeare,A horse and a man
Shakespeare,"Is more than one,"
Shakespeare,And yet not many.
Shakespeare,Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
Shakespeare,"Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?"
Shakespeare,"You are welcome, sir."
Shakespeare,And yet I come not well.
Shakespeare,And yet you halt not.
Shakespeare,Not so well apparell'd
Shakespeare,As I wish you were.
Shakespeare,"Were it better, I should rush in thus."
Shakespeare,But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
Shakespeare,"How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:"
Shakespeare,"And wherefore gaze this goodly company,"
Shakespeare,"As if they saw some wondrous monument,"
Shakespeare,Some comet or unusual prodigy?
Shakespeare,"Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:"
Shakespeare,"First were we sad, fearing you would not come,"
Shakespeare,"Now sadder, that you come so unprovided."
Shakespeare,"Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,"
Shakespeare,An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
Shakespeare,"And tells us, what occasion of import"
Shakespeare,"Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,"
Shakespeare,And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
Shakespeare,"Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:"
Shakespeare,"Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,"
Shakespeare,"Though in some part enforced to digress,"
Shakespeare,"Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse"
Shakespeare,As you shall well be satisfied withal.
Shakespeare,But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
Shakespeare,"The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church."
Shakespeare,See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
Shakespeare,"Go to my chamber, Put on clothes of mine."
Shakespeare,"Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her."
Shakespeare,"But thus, I trust, you will not marry her."
Shakespeare,"Good sooth, even thus, therefore ha' done with words:"
Shakespeare,"To me she's married, not unto my clothes:"
Shakespeare,"Could I repair what she will wear in me,"
Shakespeare,"As I can change these poor accoutrements,"
Shakespeare,'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
Shakespeare,"But what a fool am I to chat with you,"
Shakespeare,"When I should bid good morrow to my bride,"
Shakespeare,And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
Shakespeare,Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
Shakespeare,He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
Shakespeare,"We will persuade him, be it possible,"
Shakespeare,To put on better ere he go to church.
Shakespeare,"I'll after him, and see the event of this."
Shakespeare,"Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and attendants"
Shakespeare,But to her love concerneth us to add
Shakespeare,"Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,"
Shakespeare,"As I before unparted to your worship,"
Shakespeare,"I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,"
Shakespeare,"It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--"
Shakespeare,"And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,"
Shakespeare,And make assurance here in Padua
Shakespeare,Of greater sums than I have promised.
Shakespeare,"So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,"
Shakespeare,And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
Shakespeare,Were it not that my fellow-school-master
Shakespeare,"Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,"
Shakespeare,"'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage,"
Shakespeare,"Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,"
Shakespeare,"I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world."
Shakespeare,"That by degrees we mean to look into,"
Shakespeare,And watch our vantage in this business:
Shakespeare,"We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,"
Shakespeare,"The narrow-prying father, Minola,"
Shakespeare,"The quaint musician, amorous Licio,"
Shakespeare,"All for my master's sake, Lucentio."
Shakespeare,Re-enter GREMIO
Shakespeare,"Signior Gremio, came you from the church?"
Shakespeare,As willingly as e'er I came from school.
Shakespeare,And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
Shakespeare,"A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,"
Shakespeare,"A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find."
Shakespeare,"Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible."
Shakespeare,"Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend."
Shakespeare,"Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam."
Shakespeare,"Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!"
Shakespeare,"I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest"
Shakespeare,"Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,"
Shakespeare,"'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he, and swore so loud,"
Shakespeare,"That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book,"
Shakespeare,"And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,"
Shakespeare,The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
Shakespeare,That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
Shakespeare,"'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'"
Shakespeare,What said the wench when he rose again?
Shakespeare,"Trembled and shook, for why, he stamp'd and swore,"
Shakespeare,As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
Shakespeare,"But after many ceremonies done,"
Shakespeare,"He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if"
Shakespeare,"He had been aboard, carousing to his mates"
Shakespeare,"After a storm, quaff'd off the muscadel"
Shakespeare,"And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,"
Shakespeare,Having no other reason
Shakespeare,But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
Shakespeare,And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
Shakespeare,"This done, he took the bride about the neck"
Shakespeare,And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
Shakespeare,That at the parting all the church did echo:
Shakespeare,"And I seeing this came thence for very shame,"
Shakespeare,"And after me, I know, the rout is coming."
Shakespeare,Such a mad marriage never was before:
Shakespeare,"Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play."
Shakespeare,"Re-enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, BAPTISTA, HORTENSIO, GRUMIO, and Train"
Shakespeare,"Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:"
Shakespeare,"I know you think to dine with me to-day,"
Shakespeare,"And have prepared great store of wedding cheer,"
Shakespeare,"But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,"
Shakespeare,And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
Shakespeare,Is't possible you will away to-night?
Shakespeare,"I must away to-day, before night come:"
Shakespeare,"Make it no wonder, if you knew my business,"
Shakespeare,You would entreat me rather go than stay.
Shakespeare,"And, honest company, I thank you all,"
Shakespeare,That have beheld me give away myself
Shakespeare,"To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:"
Shakespeare,"Dine with my father, drink a health to me,"
Shakespeare,"For I must hence, and farewell to you all."
Shakespeare,Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
Shakespeare,Let me entreat you.
Shakespeare,Let me entreat you.
Shakespeare,Are you content to stay?
Shakespeare,"I am content you shall entreat me stay,"
Shakespeare,"But yet not stay, entreat me how you can."
Shakespeare,"Now, if you love me, stay."
Shakespeare,"Grumio, my horse."
Shakespeare,"Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses."
Shakespeare,"Nay, then,"
Shakespeare,"Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day,"
Shakespeare,"No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself."
Shakespeare,"The door is open, sir, there lies your way,"
Shakespeare,"You may be jogging whiles your boots are green,"
Shakespeare,"For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:"
Shakespeare,"'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,"
Shakespeare,That take it on you at the first so roundly.
Shakespeare,"O Kate, content thee, prithee, be not angry."
Shakespeare,I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
Shakespeare,"Father, be quiet, he shall stay my leisure."
Shakespeare,"Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work."
Shakespeare,"Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:"
Shakespeare,"I see a woman may be made a fool,"
Shakespeare,If she had not a spirit to resist.
Shakespeare,"They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command."
Shakespeare,"Obey the bride, you that attend on her,"
Shakespeare,"Go to the feast, revel and domineer,"
Shakespeare,"Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,"
Shakespeare,"Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:"
Shakespeare,"But for my bonny Kate, she must with me."
Shakespeare,"Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret,"
Shakespeare,I will be master of what is mine own:
Shakespeare,"She is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,"
Shakespeare,"My household stuff, my field, my barn,"
Shakespeare,"My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,"
Shakespeare,"And here she stands, touch her whoever dare,"
Shakespeare,I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
Shakespeare,"That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,"
Shakespeare,"Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves,"
Shakespeare,"Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man."
Shakespeare,"Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch"
Shakespeare,"thee, Kate:"
Shakespeare,I'll buckler thee against a million.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, and GRUMIO"
Shakespeare,"Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones."
Shakespeare,"Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing."
Shakespeare,Of all mad matches never was the like.
Shakespeare,"Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?"
Shakespeare,"That, being mad herself, she's madly mated."
Shakespeare,"I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated."
Shakespeare,"Neighbours and friends, though bride and"
Shakespeare,bridegroom wants
Shakespeare,"For to supply the places at the table,"
Shakespeare,You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Shakespeare,"Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place:"
Shakespeare,And let Bianca take her sister's room.
Shakespeare,Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
Shakespeare,"She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. PETRUCHIO'S country house.
Shakespeare,Enter GRUMIO
Shakespeare,"Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and"
Shakespeare,all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever
Shakespeare,man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent
Shakespeare,"before to make a fire, and they are coming after to"
Shakespeare,"warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon"
Shakespeare,"hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my"
Shakespeare,"tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my"
Shakespeare,"belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but"
Shakespeare,"I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself, for,"
Shakespeare,"considering the weather, a taller man than I will"
Shakespeare,"take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis."
Shakespeare,Enter CURTIS
Shakespeare,Who is that calls so coldly?
Shakespeare,"A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide"
Shakespeare,from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
Shakespeare,but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.
Shakespeare,"Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?"
Shakespeare,"O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire, cast"
Shakespeare,on no water.
Shakespeare,Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
Shakespeare,"She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou"
Shakespeare,"knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast, for it"
Shakespeare,hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
Shakespeare,"myself, fellow Curtis."
Shakespeare,"Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast."
Shakespeare,"Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot, and"
Shakespeare,so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a
Shakespeare,"fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,"
Shakespeare,"whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon"
Shakespeare,"feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?"
Shakespeare,"I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?"
Shakespeare,"A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine, and"
Shakespeare,"therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty, for"
Shakespeare,my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
Shakespeare,"There's fire ready, and therefore, good Grumio, the news."
Shakespeare,"Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as"
Shakespeare,will thaw.
Shakespeare,"Come, you are so full of cony-catching!"
Shakespeare,"Why, therefore fire, for I have caught extreme cold."
Shakespeare,"Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house"
Shakespeare,"trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the"
Shakespeare,"serving-men in their new fustian, their white"
Shakespeare,"stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?"
Shakespeare,"Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,"
Shakespeare,"the carpets laid, and every thing in order?"
Shakespeare,"All ready, and therefore, I pray thee, news."
Shakespeare,"First, know, my horse is tired, my master and"
Shakespeare,mistress fallen out.
Shakespeare,"Out of their saddles into the dirt, and thereby"
Shakespeare,hangs a tale.
Shakespeare,"Let's ha't, good Grumio."
Shakespeare,Lend thine ear.
Shakespeare,"This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale."
Shakespeare,And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
Shakespeare,"cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech"
Shakespeare,"listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a"
Shakespeare,"foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--"
Shakespeare,Both of one horse?
Shakespeare,What's that to thee?
Shakespeare,"Why, a horse."
Shakespeare,"Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,"
Shakespeare,thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
Shakespeare,"under her horse, thou shouldst have heard in how"
Shakespeare,"miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her"
Shakespeare,"with the horse upon her, how he beat me because"
Shakespeare,"her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt"
Shakespeare,"to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,"
Shakespeare,"that never prayed before, how I cried, how the"
Shakespeare,"horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I"
Shakespeare,"lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,"
Shakespeare,which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
Shakespeare,unexperienced to thy grave.
Shakespeare,By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.
Shakespeare,"Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall"
Shakespeare,find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?
Shakespeare,"Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,"
Shakespeare,"Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be"
Shakespeare,sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
Shakespeare,garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy
Shakespeare,with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
Shakespeare,of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their
Shakespeare,hands. Are they all ready?
Shakespeare,They are.
Shakespeare,Call them forth.
Shakespeare,"Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to"
Shakespeare,countenance my mistress.
Shakespeare,"Why, she hath a face of her own."
Shakespeare,Who knows not that?
Shakespeare,"Thou, it seems, that calls for company to"
Shakespeare,countenance her.
Shakespeare,I call them forth to credit her.
Shakespeare,"Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them."
Shakespeare,Enter four or five Serving-men
Shakespeare,"Welcome home, Grumio!"
Shakespeare,"How now, Grumio!"
Shakespeare,"What, Grumio!"
Shakespeare,Fellow Grumio!
Shakespeare,"How now, old lad?"
Shakespeare,"Welcome, you,--how now, you,-- what, you,--fellow,"
Shakespeare,"you,--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce"
Shakespeare,"companions, is all ready, and all things neat?"
Shakespeare,All things is ready. How near is our master?
Shakespeare,"E'en at hand, alighted by this, and therefore be"
Shakespeare,"not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master."
Shakespeare,Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA
Shakespeare,"Where be these knaves? What, no man at door"
Shakespeare,To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
Shakespeare,"Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?"
Shakespeare,"ALL SERVING-MEN	Here, here, sir, here, sir."
Shakespeare,"Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!"
Shakespeare,You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
Shakespeare,"What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?"
Shakespeare,Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
Shakespeare,"Here, sir, as foolish as I was before."
Shakespeare,You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Shakespeare,"Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,"
Shakespeare,And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
Shakespeare,"Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,"
Shakespeare,"And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel,"
Shakespeare,"There was no link to colour Peter's hat,"
Shakespeare,And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:
Shakespeare,"There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory,"
Shakespeare,"The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly,"
Shakespeare,"Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you."
Shakespeare,"Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in."
Shakespeare,Where is the life that late I led--
Shakespeare,"Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--"
Shakespeare,"Sound, sound, sound, sound!"
Shakespeare,Re-enter Servants with supper
Shakespeare,"Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry."
Shakespeare,"Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?"
Shakespeare,"It was the friar of orders grey,"
Shakespeare,As he forth walked on his way:--
Shakespeare,"Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:"
Shakespeare,"Take that, and mend the plucking off the other."
Shakespeare,"Be merry, Kate. Some water, here, what, ho!"
Shakespeare,"Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,"
Shakespeare,And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
Shakespeare,"One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with."
Shakespeare,Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
Shakespeare,Enter one with water
Shakespeare,"Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily."
Shakespeare,You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?
Shakespeare,"Patience, I pray you, 'twas a fault unwilling."
Shakespeare,"A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!"
Shakespeare,"Come, Kate, sit down, I know you have a stomach."
Shakespeare,"Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?"
Shakespeare,What's this? mutton?
Shakespeare,Who brought it?
Shakespeare,I.
Shakespeare,"'Tis burnt, and so is all the meat."
Shakespeare,What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
Shakespeare,"How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,"
Shakespeare,And serve it thus to me that love it not?
Shakespeare,"Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all,"
Shakespeare,"Throws the meat,  and c. about the stage"
Shakespeare,You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
Shakespeare,"What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight."
Shakespeare,"I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:"
Shakespeare,"The meat was well, if you were so contented."
Shakespeare,"I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away,"
Shakespeare,"And I expressly am forbid to touch it,"
Shakespeare,"For it engenders choler, planteth anger,"
Shakespeare,"And better 'twere that both of us did fast,"
Shakespeare,"Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,"
Shakespeare,Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Shakespeare,"Be patient, to-morrow 't shall be mended,"
Shakespeare,"And, for this night, we'll fast for company:"
Shakespeare,"Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber."
Shakespeare,Re-enter Servants severally
Shakespeare,"Peter, didst ever see the like?"
Shakespeare,He kills her in her own humour.
Shakespeare,Re-enter CURTIS
Shakespeare,"In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her,"
Shakespeare,"And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,"
Shakespeare,"Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,"
Shakespeare,And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
Shakespeare,"Away, away! for he is coming hither."
Shakespeare,Re-enter PETRUCHIO
Shakespeare,"Thus have I politicly begun my reign,"
Shakespeare,And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
Shakespeare,"My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,"
Shakespeare,"And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,"
Shakespeare,For then she never looks upon her lure.
Shakespeare,"Another way I have to man my haggard,"
Shakespeare,"To make her come and know her keeper's call,"
Shakespeare,"That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites"
Shakespeare,That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
Shakespeare,"She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat,"
Shakespeare,"Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not,"
Shakespeare,"As with the meat, some undeserved fault"
Shakespeare,"I'll find about the making of the bed,"
Shakespeare,"And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,"
Shakespeare,"This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:"
Shakespeare,"Ay, and amid this hurly I intend"
Shakespeare,"That all is done in reverend care of her,"
Shakespeare,And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
Shakespeare,And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
Shakespeare,And with the clamour keep her still awake.
Shakespeare,"This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,"
Shakespeare,And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
Shakespeare,"He that knows better how to tame a shrew,"
Shakespeare,Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.
Shakespeare,Enter TRANIO and HORTENSIO
Shakespeare,"Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca"
Shakespeare,Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
Shakespeare,"I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand."
Shakespeare,"Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,"
Shakespeare,Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
Shakespeare,Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO
Shakespeare,"Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?"
Shakespeare,"What, master, read you? first resolve me that."
Shakespeare,"I read that I profess, the Art to Love."
Shakespeare,"And may you prove, sir, master of your art!"
Shakespeare,"While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!"
Shakespeare,"Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,"
Shakespeare,You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
Shakespeare,Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.
Shakespeare,O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
Shakespeare,"I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful."
Shakespeare,"Mistake no more: I am not Licio,"
Shakespeare,"Nor a musician, as I seem to be,"
Shakespeare,"But one that scorn to live in this disguise,"
Shakespeare,"For such a one as leaves a gentleman,"
Shakespeare,And makes a god of such a cullion:
Shakespeare,"Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio."
Shakespeare,"Signior Hortensio, I have often heard"
Shakespeare,"Of your entire affection to Bianca,"
Shakespeare,"And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,"
Shakespeare,"I will with you, if you be so contented,"
Shakespeare,Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
Shakespeare,"See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,"
Shakespeare,"Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow"
Shakespeare,"Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,"
Shakespeare,As one unworthy all the former favours
Shakespeare,That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
Shakespeare,"And here I take the unfeigned oath,"
Shakespeare,Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
Shakespeare,"Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!"
Shakespeare,Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
Shakespeare,"For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,"
Shakespeare,"I will be married to a wealthy widow,"
Shakespeare,"Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me"
Shakespeare,As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
Shakespeare,"And so farewell, Signior Lucentio."
Shakespeare,"Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,"
Shakespeare,"Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,"
Shakespeare,In resolution as I swore before.
Shakespeare,"Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace"
Shakespeare,As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
Shakespeare,"Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,"
Shakespeare,And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
Shakespeare,"Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?"
Shakespeare,"Mistress, we have."
Shakespeare,Then we are rid of Licio.
Shakespeare,"I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,"
Shakespeare,That shall be wood and wedded in a day.
Shakespeare,God give him joy!
Shakespeare,"Ay, and he'll tame her."
Shakespeare,"He says so, Tranio."
Shakespeare,"Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school."
Shakespeare,"The taming-school! what, is there such a place?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master,"
Shakespeare,"That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,"
Shakespeare,To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
Shakespeare,"O master, master, I have watch'd so long"
Shakespeare,That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
Shakespeare,"An ancient angel coming down the hill,"
Shakespeare,Will serve the turn.
Shakespeare,"What is he, Biondello?"
Shakespeare,"Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,"
Shakespeare,"I know not what, but format in apparel,"
Shakespeare,In gait and countenance surely like a father.
Shakespeare,"And what of him, Tranio?"
Shakespeare,"If he be credulous and trust my tale,"
Shakespeare,"I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,"
Shakespeare,"And give assurance to Baptista Minola,"
Shakespeare,As if he were the right Vincentio
Shakespeare,"Take in your love, and then let me alone."
Shakespeare,Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
Shakespeare,Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
Shakespeare,Enter a Pedant
Shakespeare,"God save you, sir!"
Shakespeare,"And you, sir! you are welcome."
Shakespeare,"Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?"
Shakespeare,"Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:"
Shakespeare,"But then up farther, and as for as Rome,"
Shakespeare,"And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life."
Shakespeare,"What countryman, I pray?"
Shakespeare,Of Mantua.
Shakespeare,"Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!"
Shakespeare,"And come to Padua, careless of your life?"
Shakespeare,"My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard."
Shakespeare,'Tis death for any one in Mantua
Shakespeare,To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Shakespeare,"Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,"
Shakespeare,"For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,"
Shakespeare,Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
Shakespeare,"'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,"
Shakespeare,You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
Shakespeare,"Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so,"
Shakespeare,For I have bills for money by exchange
Shakespeare,From Florence and must here deliver them.
Shakespeare,"Well, sir, to do you courtesy,"
Shakespeare,"This will I do, and this I will advise you:"
Shakespeare,"First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,"
Shakespeare,Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
Shakespeare,Among them know you one Vincentio?
Shakespeare,"I know him not, but I have heard of him,"
Shakespeare,A merchant of incomparable wealth.
Shakespeare,"He is my father, sir, and, sooth to say,"
Shakespeare,In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster,"
Shakespeare,and all one.
Shakespeare,"To save your life in this extremity,"
Shakespeare,"This favour will I do you for his sake,"
Shakespeare,And think it not the worst of an your fortunes
Shakespeare,That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
Shakespeare,"His name and credit shall you undertake,"
Shakespeare,And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
Shakespeare,"Look that you take upon you as you should,"
Shakespeare,"You understand me, sir: so shall you stay"
Shakespeare,Till you have done your business in the city:
Shakespeare,"If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it."
Shakespeare,"O sir, I do, and will repute you ever"
Shakespeare,The patron of my life and liberty.
Shakespeare,Then go with me to make the matter good.
Shakespeare,"This, by the way, I let you understand,"
Shakespeare,"my father is here look'd for every day,"
Shakespeare,To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
Shakespeare,'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
Shakespeare,In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
Shakespeare,Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.
Shakespeare,SCENE III. A room in PETRUCHIO'S house.
Shakespeare,Enter KATHARINA and GRUMIO
Shakespeare,"No, no, forsooth, I dare not for my life."
Shakespeare,"The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:"
Shakespeare,"What, did he marry me to famish me?"
Shakespeare,"Beggars, that come unto my father's door,"
Shakespeare,"Upon entreaty have a present aims,"
Shakespeare,"If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:"
Shakespeare,"But I, who never knew how to entreat,"
Shakespeare,"Nor never needed that I should entreat,"
Shakespeare,"Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,"
Shakespeare,With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
Shakespeare,"And that which spites me more than all these wants,"
Shakespeare,"He does it under name of perfect love,"
Shakespeare,"As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,"
Shakespeare,'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
Shakespeare,"I prithee go and get me some repast,"
Shakespeare,"I care not what, so it be wholesome food."
Shakespeare,What say you to a neat's foot?
Shakespeare,'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.
Shakespeare,I fear it is too choleric a meat.
Shakespeare,How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?
Shakespeare,"I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me."
Shakespeare,"I cannot tell, I fear 'tis choleric."
Shakespeare,What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
Shakespeare,A dish that I do love to feed upon.
Shakespeare,"Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little."
Shakespeare,"Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest."
Shakespeare,"Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,"
Shakespeare,Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
Shakespeare,"Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt."
Shakespeare,"Why then, the mustard without the beef."
Shakespeare,"Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,"
Shakespeare,Beats him
Shakespeare,That feed'st me with the very name of meat:
Shakespeare,"Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,"
Shakespeare,That triumph thus upon my misery!
Shakespeare,"Go, get thee gone, I say."
Shakespeare,Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat
Shakespeare,"How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?"
Shakespeare,"Mistress, what cheer?"
Shakespeare,"Faith, as cold as can be."
Shakespeare,"Pluck up thy spirits, look cheerfully upon me."
Shakespeare,"Here love, thou see'st how diligent I am"
Shakespeare,To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:
Shakespeare,"I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks."
Shakespeare,"What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not,"
Shakespeare,And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Shakespeare,"Here, take away this dish."
Shakespeare,"I pray you, let it stand."
Shakespeare,"The poorest service is repaid with thanks,"
Shakespeare,"And so shall mine, before you touch the meat."
Shakespeare,"Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame."
Shakespeare,"Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company."
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me."
Shakespeare,Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
Shakespeare,"Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love,"
Shakespeare,Will we return unto thy father's house
Shakespeare,"And revel it as bravely as the best,"
Shakespeare,"With silken coats and caps and golden rings,"
Shakespeare,"With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things,"
Shakespeare,"With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,"
Shakespeare,"With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery."
Shakespeare,"What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,"
Shakespeare,To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
Shakespeare,Enter Tailor
Shakespeare,"Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments,"
Shakespeare,Lay forth the gown.
Shakespeare,Enter Haberdasher
Shakespeare,"What news with you, sir?"
Shakespeare,Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
Shakespeare,"Why, this was moulded on a porringer,"
Shakespeare,"A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:"
Shakespeare,"Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,"
Shakespeare,"A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:"
Shakespeare,"Away with it! come, let me have a bigger."
Shakespeare,"I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,"
Shakespeare,And gentlewomen wear such caps as these
Shakespeare,"When you are gentle, you shall have one too,"
Shakespeare,And not till then.
Shakespeare,[Aside]  That will not be in haste.
Shakespeare,"Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak,"
Shakespeare,"And speak I will, I am no child, no babe:"
Shakespeare,"Your betters have endured me say my mind,"
Shakespeare,"And if you cannot, best you stop your ears."
Shakespeare,"My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,"
Shakespeare,"Or else my heart concealing it will break,"
Shakespeare,"And rather than it shall, I will be free"
Shakespeare,"Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words."
Shakespeare,"Why, thou say'st true, it is a paltry cap,"
Shakespeare,"A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:"
Shakespeare,"I love thee well, in that thou likest it not."
Shakespeare,"Love me or love me not, I like the cap,"
Shakespeare,"And it I will have, or I will have none."
Shakespeare,Exit Haberdasher
Shakespeare,"Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't."
Shakespeare,"O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?"
Shakespeare,What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
Shakespeare,"What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?"
Shakespeare,"Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,"
Shakespeare,Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
Shakespeare,"Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?"
Shakespeare,[Aside]  I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.
Shakespeare,"You bid me make it orderly and well,"
Shakespeare,According to the fashion and the time.
Shakespeare,"Marry, and did, but if you be remember'd,"
Shakespeare,I did not bid you mar it to the time.
Shakespeare,"Go, hop me over every kennel home,"
Shakespeare,"For you shall hop without my custom, sir:"
Shakespeare,I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.
Shakespeare,"I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,"
Shakespeare,"More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:"
Shakespeare,Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
Shakespeare,"Why, true, he means to make a puppet of thee."
Shakespeare,She says your worship means to make
Shakespeare,a puppet of her.
Shakespeare,"O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,"
Shakespeare,"thou thimble,"
Shakespeare,"Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!"
Shakespeare,"Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!"
Shakespeare,Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Shakespeare,"Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant,"
Shakespeare,Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
Shakespeare,As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!
Shakespeare,"I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown."
Shakespeare,"Your worship is deceived, the gown is made"
Shakespeare,Just as my master had direction:
Shakespeare,Grumio gave order how it should be done.
Shakespeare,"I gave him no order, I gave him the stuff."
Shakespeare,But how did you desire it should be made?
Shakespeare,"Marry, sir, with needle and thread."
Shakespeare,But did you not request to have it cut?
Shakespeare,Thou hast faced many things.
Shakespeare,"Face not me: thou hast braved many men, brave not"
Shakespeare,"me, I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto"
Shakespeare,"thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown, but I did"
Shakespeare,"not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest."
Shakespeare,"Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify"
Shakespeare,Read it.
Shakespeare,"The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so."
Shakespeare,"[Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown:'"
Shakespeare,"Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in"
Shakespeare,"the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom"
Shakespeare,of brown thread: I said a gown.
Shakespeare,[Reads]  'With a small compassed cape:'
Shakespeare,I confess the cape.
Shakespeare,[Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve:'
Shakespeare,I confess two sleeves.
Shakespeare,[Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.'
Shakespeare,"Ay, there's the villany."
Shakespeare,"Error i' the bill, sir, error i' the bill."
Shakespeare,I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
Shakespeare,"sewed up again, and that I'll prove upon thee,"
Shakespeare,though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.
Shakespeare,This is true that I say: an I had thee
Shakespeare,"in place where, thou shouldst know it."
Shakespeare,I am for thee straight: take thou the
Shakespeare,"bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me."
Shakespeare,"God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds."
Shakespeare,"Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me."
Shakespeare,"You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress."
Shakespeare,"Go, take it up unto thy master's use."
Shakespeare,"Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'"
Shakespeare,gown for thy master's use!
Shakespeare,"Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?"
Shakespeare,"O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:"
Shakespeare,Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid."
Shakespeare,"Go take it hence, be gone, and say no more."
Shakespeare,"Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:"
Shakespeare,Take no unkindness of his hasty words:
Shakespeare,"Away! I say, commend me to thy master."
Shakespeare,Exit Tailor
Shakespeare,"Well, come, my Kate, we will unto your father's"
Shakespeare,Even in these honest mean habiliments:
Shakespeare,"Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor,"
Shakespeare,"For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich,"
Shakespeare,"And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,"
Shakespeare,So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
Shakespeare,"What is the jay more precious than the lark,"
Shakespeare,Because his fathers are more beautiful?
Shakespeare,"Or is the adder better than the eel,"
Shakespeare,Because his painted skin contents the eye?
Shakespeare,"O, no, good Kate, neither art thou the worse"
Shakespeare,For this poor furniture and mean array.
Shakespeare,"if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me,"
Shakespeare,"And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,"
Shakespeare,To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
Shakespeare,"Go, call my men, and let us straight to him,"
Shakespeare,"And bring our horses unto Long-lane end,"
Shakespeare,"There will we mount, and thither walk on foot"
Shakespeare,"Let's see, I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,"
Shakespeare,And well we may come there by dinner-time.
Shakespeare,"I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two,"
Shakespeare,And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
Shakespeare,It shall be seven ere I go to horse:
Shakespeare,"Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,"
Shakespeare,"You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:"
Shakespeare,"I will not go to-day, and ere I do,"
Shakespeare,It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  Why, so this gallant will command the sun."
Shakespeare,SCENE IV. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
Shakespeare,"Enter TRANIO, and the Pedant dressed like VINCENTIO"
Shakespeare,"Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, what else? and but I be deceived"
Shakespeare,"Signior Baptista may remember me,"
Shakespeare,"Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,"
Shakespeare,Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
Shakespeare,"'Tis well, and hold your own, in any case,"
Shakespeare,With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.
Shakespeare,I warrant you.
Shakespeare,"But, sir, here comes your boy,"
Shakespeare,'Twere good he were school'd.
Shakespeare,"Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,"
Shakespeare,"Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:"
Shakespeare,Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
Shakespeare,"Tut, fear not me."
Shakespeare,But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
Shakespeare,"I told him that your father was at Venice,"
Shakespeare,And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.
Shakespeare,Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
Shakespeare,"Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir."
Shakespeare,Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO
Shakespeare,"Signior Baptista, you are happily met."
Shakespeare,To the Pedant
Shakespeare,"Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:"
Shakespeare,"I pray you stand good father to me now,"
Shakespeare,Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
Shakespeare,Soft son!
Shakespeare,"Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua"
Shakespeare,"To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio"
Shakespeare,Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Shakespeare,Of love between your daughter and himself:
Shakespeare,"And, for the good report I hear of you"
Shakespeare,And for the love he beareth to your daughter
Shakespeare,"And she to him, to stay him not too long,"
Shakespeare,"I am content, in a good father's care,"
Shakespeare,"To have him match'd, and if you please to like"
Shakespeare,"No worse than I, upon some agreement"
Shakespeare,Me shall you find ready and willing
Shakespeare,"With one consent to have her so bestow'd,"
Shakespeare,"For curious I cannot be with you,"
Shakespeare,"Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well."
Shakespeare,"Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:"
Shakespeare,Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Shakespeare,"Right true it is, your son Lucentio here"
Shakespeare,"Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,"
Shakespeare,Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
Shakespeare,"And therefore, if you say no more than this,"
Shakespeare,That like a father you will deal with him
Shakespeare,"And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,"
Shakespeare,"The match is made, and all is done:"
Shakespeare,Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
Shakespeare,"I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best"
Shakespeare,We be affied and such assurance ta'en
Shakespeare,As shall with either part's agreement stand?
Shakespeare,"Not in my house, Lucentio, for, you know,"
Shakespeare,"Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:"
Shakespeare,"Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still,"
Shakespeare,And happily we might be interrupted.
Shakespeare,"Then at my lodging, an it like you:"
Shakespeare,"There doth my father lie, and there, this night,"
Shakespeare,We'll pass the business privately and well.
Shakespeare,Send for your daughter by your servant here:
Shakespeare,My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
Shakespeare,"The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,"
Shakespeare,You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
Shakespeare,"It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,"
Shakespeare,"And bid Bianca make her ready straight,"
Shakespeare,"And, if you will, tell what hath happened,"
Shakespeare,"Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,"
Shakespeare,And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.
Shakespeare,I pray the gods she may with all my heart!
Shakespeare,"Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone."
Shakespeare,Exit BIONDELLO
Shakespeare,Exit BIONDELLO
Shakespeare,"Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?"
Shakespeare,Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:

Shakespeare,Cambio!
Shakespeare,"What sayest thou, Biondello?"
Shakespeare,You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
Shakespeare,"Biondello, what of that?"
Shakespeare,"Faith, nothing, but has left me here behind, to"
Shakespeare,expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
Shakespeare,"I pray thee, moralize them."
Shakespeare,"Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the"
Shakespeare,deceiving father of a deceitful son.
Shakespeare,And what of him?
Shakespeare,His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
Shakespeare,The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
Shakespeare,command at all hours.
Shakespeare,And what of all this?
Shakespeare,"I cannot tell, expect they are busied about a"
Shakespeare,"counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,"
Shakespeare,'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the
Shakespeare,"church, take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient"
Shakespeare,"honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,"
Shakespeare,"I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for"
Shakespeare,ever and a day.
Shakespeare,"Hearest thou, Biondello?"
Shakespeare,I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
Shakespeare,afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
Shakespeare,"stuff a rabbit, and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,"
Shakespeare,sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
Shakespeare,"Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against"
Shakespeare,you come with your appendix.
Shakespeare,"I may, and will, if she be so contented:"
Shakespeare,"She will be pleased, then wherefore should I doubt?"
Shakespeare,"Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:"
Shakespeare,It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.
Shakespeare,SCENE V. A public road.
Shakespeare,"Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Servants"
Shakespeare,"Come on, i' God's name, once more toward our father's."
Shakespeare,"Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!"
Shakespeare,The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.
Shakespeare,I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
Shakespeare,I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
Shakespeare,"Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,"
Shakespeare,"It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,"
Shakespeare,Or ere I journey to your father's house.
Shakespeare,"Go on, and fetch our horses back again."
Shakespeare,"Evermore cross'd and cross'd, nothing but cross'd!"
Shakespeare,"Say as he says, or we shall never go."
Shakespeare,"Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,"
Shakespeare,"And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:"
Shakespeare,"An if you please to call it a rush-candle,"
Shakespeare,Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
Shakespeare,I say it is the moon.
Shakespeare,I know it is the moon.
Shakespeare,"Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun."
Shakespeare,"Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:"
Shakespeare,"But sun it is not, when you say it is not,"
Shakespeare,And the moon changes even as your mind.
Shakespeare,"What you will have it named, even that it is,"
Shakespeare,And so it shall be so for Katharina.
Shakespeare,"Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won."
Shakespeare,"Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,"
Shakespeare,And not unluckily against the bias.
Shakespeare,"But, soft! company is coming here."
Shakespeare,Enter VINCENTIO
Shakespeare,To VINCENTIO
Shakespeare,"Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?"
Shakespeare,"Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,"
Shakespeare,Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
Shakespeare,Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
Shakespeare,"What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,"
Shakespeare,As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
Shakespeare,"Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee."
Shakespeare,"Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake."
Shakespeare,"A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him."
Shakespeare,"Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,"
Shakespeare,"Whither away, or where is thy abode?"
Shakespeare,"Happy the parents of so fair a child,"
Shakespeare,"Happier the man, whom favourable stars"
Shakespeare,Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!
Shakespeare,"Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:"
Shakespeare,"This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,"
Shakespeare,"And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is."
Shakespeare,"Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,"
Shakespeare,That have been so bedazzled with the sun
Shakespeare,That everything I look on seemeth green:
Shakespeare,"Now I perceive thou art a reverend father,"
Shakespeare,"Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking."
Shakespeare,"Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known"
Shakespeare,"Which way thou travellest: if along with us,"
Shakespeare,We shall be joyful of thy company.
Shakespeare,"Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,"
Shakespeare,"That with your strange encounter much amazed me,"
Shakespeare,"My name is call'd Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,"
Shakespeare,"And bound I am to Padua, there to visit"
Shakespeare,"A son of mine, which long I have not seen."
Shakespeare,"Lucentio, gentle sir."
Shakespeare,"Happily we met, the happier for thy son."
Shakespeare,"And now by law, as well as reverend age,"
Shakespeare,I may entitle thee my loving father:
Shakespeare,"The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,"
Shakespeare,"Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,"
Shakespeare,"Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,"
Shakespeare,"Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth,"
Shakespeare,"Beside, so qualified as may beseem"
Shakespeare,The spouse of any noble gentleman.
Shakespeare,"Let me embrace with old Vincentio,"
Shakespeare,"And wander we to see thy honest son,"
Shakespeare,Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
Shakespeare,"But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,"
Shakespeare,"Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest"
Shakespeare,Upon the company you overtake?
Shakespeare,"I do assure thee, father, so it is."
Shakespeare,"Come, go along, and see the truth hereof,"
Shakespeare,For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
Shakespeare,Exeunt all but HORTENSIO
Shakespeare,"Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart."
Shakespeare,"Have to my widow! and if she be froward,"
Shakespeare,Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Padua. Before LUCENTIO'S house.
Shakespeare,"GREMIO discovered. Enter behind BIONDELLO, LUCENTIO, and BIANCA"
Shakespeare,"Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready."
Shakespeare,"I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee"
Shakespeare,"at home, therefore leave us."
Shakespeare,"Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back, and"
Shakespeare,then come back to my master's as soon as I can.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt LUCENTIO, BIANCA, and BIONDELLO"
Shakespeare,I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
Shakespeare,"Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, VINCENTIO, GRUMIO, with Attendants"
Shakespeare,"Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:"
Shakespeare,"My father's bears more toward the market-place,"
Shakespeare,"Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir."
Shakespeare,You shall not choose but drink before you go:
Shakespeare,"I think I shall command your welcome here,"
Shakespeare,"And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward."
Shakespeare,"They're busy within, you were best knock louder."
Shakespeare,Pedant looks out of the window
Shakespeare,What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
Shakespeare,"Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?"
Shakespeare,"He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal."
Shakespeare,"What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to"
Shakespeare,make merry withal?
Shakespeare,Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
Shakespeare,"need none, so long as I live."
Shakespeare,"Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua."
Shakespeare,"Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,"
Shakespeare,"I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is"
Shakespeare,"come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him."
Shakespeare,Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
Shakespeare,looking out at the window.
Shakespeare,Art thou his father?
Shakespeare,"Ay, sir, so his mother says, if I may believe her."
Shakespeare,"[To VINCENTIO]  Why, how now, gentleman! why, this"
Shakespeare,"is flat knavery, to take upon you another man's name."
Shakespeare,Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
Shakespeare,cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.
Shakespeare,I have seen them in the church together: God send
Shakespeare,'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
Shakespeare,master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.
Shakespeare,[Seeing BIONDELLO]
Shakespeare,"Come hither, crack-hemp."
Shakespeare,"Hope I may choose, sir."
Shakespeare,"Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?"
Shakespeare,"Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I"
Shakespeare,never saw you before in all my life.
Shakespeare,"What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see"
Shakespeare,"thy master's father, Vincentio?"
Shakespeare,"What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:"
Shakespeare,see where he looks out of the window.
Shakespeare,"Is't so, indeed."
Shakespeare,Beats BIONDELLO
Shakespeare,"Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me."
Shakespeare,"Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!"
Shakespeare,Exit from above
Shakespeare,"Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of"
Shakespeare,this controversy.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter Pedant below, TRANIO, BAPTISTA, and Servants"
Shakespeare,"Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?"
Shakespeare,"What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal"
Shakespeare,gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
Shakespeare,"hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I"
Shakespeare,am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
Shakespeare,"husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at"
Shakespeare,the university.
Shakespeare,"What, is the man lunatic?"
Shakespeare,"Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your"
Shakespeare,"habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,"
Shakespeare,what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
Shakespeare,"thank my good father, I am able to maintain it."
Shakespeare,Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
Shakespeare,"You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do"
Shakespeare,you think is his name?
Shakespeare,His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
Shakespeare,"him up ever since he was three years old, and his"
Shakespeare,name is Tranio.
Shakespeare,"Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is"
Shakespeare,"mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio."
Shakespeare,"Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold"
Shakespeare,"on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my"
Shakespeare,"son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?"
Shakespeare,Call forth an officer.
Shakespeare,Enter one with an Officer
Shakespeare,"Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,"
Shakespeare,I charge you see that he be forthcoming.
Shakespeare,Carry me to the gaol!
Shakespeare,"Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison."
Shakespeare,"Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison."
Shakespeare,"Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be"
Shakespeare,cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
Shakespeare,is the right Vincentio.
Shakespeare,"Swear, if thou darest."
Shakespeare,"Nay, I dare not swear it."
Shakespeare,Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
Shakespeare,"Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio."
Shakespeare,Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!
Shakespeare,Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
Shakespeare,monstrous villain!
Shakespeare,"Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA"
Shakespeare,"O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,"
Shakespeare,"forswear him, or else we are all undone."
Shakespeare,"[Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father."
Shakespeare,Lives my sweet son?
Shakespeare,"Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and Pedant, as fast as may be"
Shakespeare,"Pardon, dear father."
Shakespeare,How hast thou offended?
Shakespeare,Where is Lucentio?
Shakespeare,"Here's Lucentio,"
Shakespeare,"Right son to the right Vincentio,"
Shakespeare,"That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,"
Shakespeare,While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.
Shakespeare,"Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!"
Shakespeare,"Where is that damned villain Tranio,"
Shakespeare,That faced and braved me in this matter so?
Shakespeare,"Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?"
Shakespeare,Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
Shakespeare,Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Shakespeare,"Made me exchange my state with Tranio,"
Shakespeare,"While he did bear my countenance in the town,"
Shakespeare,And happily I have arrived at the last
Shakespeare,Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
Shakespeare,"What Tranio did, myself enforced him to,"
Shakespeare,"Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake."
Shakespeare,"I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent"
Shakespeare,me to the gaol.
Shakespeare,"But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter"
Shakespeare,without asking my good will?
Shakespeare,"Fear not, Baptista, we will content you, go to: but"
Shakespeare,"I will in, to be revenged for this villany."
Shakespeare,"And I, to sound the depth of this knavery."
Shakespeare,"Look not pale, Bianca, thy father will not frown."
Shakespeare,"My cake is dough, but I'll in among the rest,"
Shakespeare,"Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast."
Shakespeare,"Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado."
Shakespeare,"First kiss me, Kate, and we will."
Shakespeare,"What, in the midst of the street?"
Shakespeare,"What, art thou ashamed of me?"
Shakespeare,"No, sir, God forbid, but ashamed to kiss."
Shakespeare,"Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away."
Shakespeare,"Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay."
Shakespeare,"Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:"
Shakespeare,"Better once than never, for never too late."
Shakespeare,SCENE II. Padua. LUCENTIO'S house.
Shakespeare,"Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the Pedant,  LUCENTIO, BIANCA, PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO,  and Widow, TRANIO, BIONDELLO, and GRUMIO the Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet"
Shakespeare,"At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:"
Shakespeare,"And time it is, when raging war is done,"
Shakespeare,To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
Shakespeare,"My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,"
Shakespeare,While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
Shakespeare,"Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,"
Shakespeare,"And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,"
Shakespeare,"Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:"
Shakespeare,"My banquet is to close our stomachs up,"
Shakespeare,"After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down,"
Shakespeare,For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
Shakespeare,"Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!"
Shakespeare,"Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio."
Shakespeare,Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
Shakespeare,"For both our sakes, I would that word were true."
Shakespeare,"Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow."
Shakespeare,"Then never trust me, if I be afeard."
Shakespeare,"You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:"
Shakespeare,"I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you."
Shakespeare,He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
Shakespeare,Roundly replied.
Shakespeare,"Mistress, how mean you that?"
Shakespeare,Thus I conceive by him.
Shakespeare,Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
Shakespeare,"My widow says, thus she conceives her tale."
Shakespeare,"Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow."
Shakespeare,'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
Shakespeare,"I pray you, tell me what you meant by that."
Shakespeare,"Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,"
Shakespeare,Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
Shakespeare,"And now you know my meaning,"
Shakespeare,A very mean meaning.
Shakespeare,"Right, I mean you."
Shakespeare,"And I am mean indeed, respecting you."
Shakespeare,"To her, Kate!"
Shakespeare,"To her, widow!"
Shakespeare,"A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down."
Shakespeare,That's my office.
Shakespeare,"Spoke like an officer, ha' to thee, lad!"
Shakespeare,Drinks to HORTENSIO
Shakespeare,How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
Shakespeare,"Believe me, sir, they butt together well."
Shakespeare,"Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body"
Shakespeare,Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
Shakespeare,"Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, but not frighted me, therefore I'll sleep again."
Shakespeare,"Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,"
Shakespeare,Have at you for a bitter jest or two!
Shakespeare,"Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,"
Shakespeare,And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
Shakespeare,You are welcome all.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow"
Shakespeare,"She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio."
Shakespeare,"This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not,"
Shakespeare,Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
Shakespeare,"O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,"
Shakespeare,Which runs himself and catches for his master.
Shakespeare,"A good swift simile, but something currish."
Shakespeare,"'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:"
Shakespeare,'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
Shakespeare,"O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now."
Shakespeare,"I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio."
Shakespeare,"Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?"
Shakespeare,"A' has a little gall'd me, I confess,"
Shakespeare,"And, as the jest did glance away from me,"
Shakespeare,'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
Shakespeare,"Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,"
Shakespeare,I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
Shakespeare,"Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance"
Shakespeare,"Let's each one send unto his wife,"
Shakespeare,And he whose wife is most obedient
Shakespeare,"To come at first when he doth send for her,"
Shakespeare,Shall win the wager which we will propose.
Shakespeare,Content. What is the wager?
Shakespeare,Twenty crowns.
Shakespeare,Twenty crowns!
Shakespeare,"I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,"
Shakespeare,But twenty times so much upon my wife.
Shakespeare,A hundred then.
Shakespeare,A match! 'tis done.
Shakespeare,Who shall begin?
Shakespeare,That will I.
Shakespeare,"Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me."
Shakespeare,"Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes."
Shakespeare,"I'll have no halves, I'll bear it all myself."
Shakespeare,"Sir, my mistress sends you word"
Shakespeare,That she is busy and she cannot come.
Shakespeare,How! she is busy and she cannot come!
Shakespeare,Is that an answer?
Shakespeare,"Ay, and a kind one too:"
Shakespeare,"Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse."
Shakespeare,I hope better.
Shakespeare,"Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife"
Shakespeare,To come to me forthwith.
Shakespeare,"O, ho! entreat her!"
Shakespeare,"Nay, then she must needs come."
Shakespeare,"I am afraid, sir,"
Shakespeare,"Do what you can, yours will not be entreated."
Shakespeare,"Now, where's my wife?"
Shakespeare,She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
Shakespeare,She will not come: she bids you come to her.
Shakespeare,"Worse and worse, she will not come! O vile,"
Shakespeare,"Intolerable, not to be endured!"
Shakespeare,"Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress,"
Shakespeare,"Say, I command her to come to me."
Shakespeare,Exit GRUMIO
Shakespeare,I know her answer.
Shakespeare,She will not.
Shakespeare,"The fouler fortune mine, and there an end."
Shakespeare,"Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!"
Shakespeare,Re-enter KATARINA
Shakespeare,"What is your will, sir, that you send for me?"
Shakespeare,"Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?"
Shakespeare,They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
Shakespeare,Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
Shakespeare,Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
Shakespeare,"Away, I say, and bring them hither straight."
Shakespeare,Exit KATHARINA
Shakespeare,"Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder."
Shakespeare,And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.
Shakespeare,"Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,"
Shakespeare,"And awful rule and right supremacy,"
Shakespeare,"And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?"
Shakespeare,"Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!"
Shakespeare,"The wager thou hast won, and I will add"
Shakespeare,"Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns,"
Shakespeare,"Another dowry to another daughter,"
Shakespeare,"For she is changed, as she had never been."
Shakespeare,"Nay, I will win my wager better yet"
Shakespeare,"And show more sign of her obedience,"
Shakespeare,Her new-built virtue and obedience.
Shakespeare,See where she comes and brings your froward wives
Shakespeare,As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow"
Shakespeare,"Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:"
Shakespeare,"Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot."
Shakespeare,"Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,"
Shakespeare,Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
Shakespeare,Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
Shakespeare,I would your duty were as foolish too:
Shakespeare,"The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,"
Shakespeare,Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
Shakespeare,"The more fool you, for laying on my duty."
Shakespeare,"Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women"
Shakespeare,What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
Shakespeare,"Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling."
Shakespeare,"Come on, I say, and first begin with her."
Shakespeare,She shall not.
Shakespeare,I say she shall: and first begin with her.
Shakespeare,"Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,"
Shakespeare,"And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,"
Shakespeare,"To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:"
Shakespeare,"It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,"
Shakespeare,"Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,"
Shakespeare,And in no sense is meet or amiable.
Shakespeare,"A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,"
Shakespeare,"Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,"
Shakespeare,"And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty"
Shakespeare,Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Shakespeare,"Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,"
Shakespeare,"Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee,"
Shakespeare,And for thy maintenance commits his body
Shakespeare,"To painful labour both by sea and land,"
Shakespeare,"To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,"
Shakespeare,"Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,"
Shakespeare,And craves no other tribute at thy hands
Shakespeare,"But love, fair looks and true obedience,"
Shakespeare,Too little payment for so great a debt.
Shakespeare,Such duty as the subject owes the prince
Shakespeare,"Even such a woman oweth to her husband,"
Shakespeare,"And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,"
Shakespeare,"And not obedient to his honest will,"
Shakespeare,What is she but a foul contending rebel
Shakespeare,And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
Shakespeare,I am ashamed that women are so simple
Shakespeare,"To offer war where they should kneel for peace,"
Shakespeare,"Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,"
Shakespeare,"When they are bound to serve, love and obey."
Shakespeare,"Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,"
Shakespeare,"Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,"
Shakespeare,But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Shakespeare,Should well agree with our external parts?
Shakespeare,"Come, come, you froward and unable worms!"
Shakespeare,"My mind hath been as big as one of yours,"
Shakespeare,"My heart as great, my reason haply more,"
Shakespeare,"To bandy word for word and frown for frown,"
Shakespeare,"But now I see our lances are but straws,"
Shakespeare,"Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,"
Shakespeare,That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Shakespeare,"Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,"
Shakespeare,And place your hands below your husband's foot:
Shakespeare,"In token of which duty, if he please,"
Shakespeare,"My hand is ready, may it do him ease."
Shakespeare,"Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate."
Shakespeare,"Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't."
Shakespeare,'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
Shakespeare,But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
Shakespeare,"Come, Kate, we'll to bed."
Shakespeare,"We three are married, but you two are sped."
Shakespeare,To LUCENTIO
Shakespeare,"'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white,"
Shakespeare,"And, being a winner, God give you good night!"
Shakespeare,Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA
Shakespeare,"Now, go thy ways, thou hast tamed a curst shrew."
Shakespeare,"'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise
Shakespeare,of thunder and lightning heard.
Shakespeare,Enter a Master and a Boatswain
Shakespeare,Boatswain!
Shakespeare,"Here, master: what cheer?"
Shakespeare,"Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,"
Shakespeare,"or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir."
Shakespeare,Enter Mariners
Shakespeare,"Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!"
Shakespeare,"yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the"
Shakespeare,"master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,"
Shakespeare,if room enough!
Shakespeare,"Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others"
Shakespeare,"Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?"
Shakespeare,Play the men.
Shakespeare,"I pray now, keep below."
Shakespeare,"Where is the master, boatswain?"
Shakespeare,Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
Shakespeare,cabins: you do assist the storm.
Shakespeare,"Nay, good, be patient."
Shakespeare,When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
Shakespeare,for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
Shakespeare,"Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard."
Shakespeare,None that I more love than myself. You are a
Shakespeare,"counsellor, if you can command these elements to"
Shakespeare,"silence, and work the peace of the present, we will"
Shakespeare,"not hand a rope more, use your authority: if you"
Shakespeare,"cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make"
Shakespeare,yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
Shakespeare,"the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out"
Shakespeare,"of our way, I say."
Shakespeare,I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
Shakespeare,"hath no drowning mark upon him, his complexion is"
Shakespeare,"perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his"
Shakespeare,"hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,"
Shakespeare,for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
Shakespeare,"born to be hanged, our case is miserable."
Shakespeare,Re-enter Boatswain
Shakespeare,"Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring"
Shakespeare,her to try with main-course.
Shakespeare,A cry within
Shakespeare,A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
Shakespeare,the weather or our office.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO"
Shakespeare,Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
Shakespeare,and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
Shakespeare,"A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,"
Shakespeare,incharitable dog!
Shakespeare,Work you then.
Shakespeare,"Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!"
Shakespeare,We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
Shakespeare,"I'll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were"
Shakespeare,no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
Shakespeare,unstanched wench.
Shakespeare,"Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to"
Shakespeare,"sea again, lay her off."
Shakespeare,Enter Mariners wet
Shakespeare,"All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!"
Shakespeare,"What, must our mouths be cold?"
Shakespeare,"The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,"
Shakespeare,For our case is as theirs.
Shakespeare,I'm out of patience.
Shakespeare,We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
Shakespeare,This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
Shakespeare,The washing of ten tides!
Shakespeare,"He'll be hang'd yet,"
Shakespeare,Though every drop of water swear against it
Shakespeare,And gape at widest to glut him.
Shakespeare,"A confused noise within:   'Mercy on us!'--  'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and  children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'"
Shakespeare,Let's all sink with the king.
Shakespeare,Let's take leave of him.
Shakespeare,Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
Shakespeare,Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
Shakespeare,"acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any"
Shakespeare,thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
Shakespeare,die a dry death.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
Shakespeare,Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA
Shakespeare,"If by your art, my dearest father, you have"
Shakespeare,"Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them."
Shakespeare,"The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,"
Shakespeare,"But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,"
Shakespeare,"Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered"
Shakespeare,"With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,"
Shakespeare,"Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,"
Shakespeare,"Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock"
Shakespeare,"Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd."
Shakespeare,"Had I been any god of power, I would"
Shakespeare,Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
Shakespeare,It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
Shakespeare,The fraughting souls within her.
Shakespeare,Be collected:
Shakespeare,No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
Shakespeare,There's no harm done.
Shakespeare,"O, woe the day!"
Shakespeare,No harm.
Shakespeare,"I have done nothing but in care of thee,"
Shakespeare,"Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who"
Shakespeare,"Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing"
Shakespeare,"Of whence I am, nor that I am more better"
Shakespeare,"Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,"
Shakespeare,And thy no greater father.
Shakespeare,More to know
Shakespeare,Did never meddle with my thoughts.
Shakespeare,'Tis time
Shakespeare,"I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,"
Shakespeare,And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
Shakespeare,Lays down his mantle
Shakespeare,"Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes, have comfort."
Shakespeare,"The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd"
Shakespeare,"The very virtue of compassion in thee,"
Shakespeare,I have with such provision in mine art
Shakespeare,So safely ordered that there is no soul--
Shakespeare,"No, not so much perdition as an hair"
Shakespeare,Betid to any creature in the vessel
Shakespeare,"Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down,"
Shakespeare,For thou must now know farther.
Shakespeare,You have often
Shakespeare,"Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd"
Shakespeare,"And left me to a bootless inquisition,"
Shakespeare,Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'
Shakespeare,"The hour's now come,"
Shakespeare,"The very minute bids thee ope thine ear,"
Shakespeare,Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
Shakespeare,A time before we came unto this cell?
Shakespeare,"I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not"
Shakespeare,Out three years old.
Shakespeare,"Certainly, sir, I can."
Shakespeare,By what? by any other house or person?
Shakespeare,Of any thing the image tell me that
Shakespeare,Hath kept with thy remembrance.
Shakespeare,'Tis far off
Shakespeare,And rather like a dream than an assurance
Shakespeare,That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Shakespeare,Four or five women once that tended me?
Shakespeare,"Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it"
Shakespeare,That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
Shakespeare,In the dark backward and abysm of time?
Shakespeare,"If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,"
Shakespeare,How thou camest here thou mayst.
Shakespeare,But that I do not.
Shakespeare,"Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,"
Shakespeare,Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
Shakespeare,A prince of power.
Shakespeare,"Sir, are not you my father?"
Shakespeare,"Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and"
Shakespeare,"She said thou wast my daughter, and thy father"
Shakespeare,"Was Duke of Milan, and thou his only heir"
Shakespeare,And princess no worse issued.
Shakespeare,O the heavens!
Shakespeare,O the heavens!
Shakespeare,"What foul play had we, that we came from thence?"
Shakespeare,Or blessed was't we did?
Shakespeare,"Both, both, my girl:"
Shakespeare,"By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,"
Shakespeare,But blessedly holp hither.
Shakespeare,"O, my heart bleeds"
Shakespeare,"To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,"
Shakespeare,"Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther."
Shakespeare,"My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--"
Shakespeare,"I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should"
Shakespeare,Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
Shakespeare,Of all the world I loved and to him put
Shakespeare,"The manage of my state, as at that time"
Shakespeare,Through all the signories it was the first
Shakespeare,"And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed"
Shakespeare,"In dignity, and for the liberal arts"
Shakespeare,"Without a parallel, those being all my study,"
Shakespeare,The government I cast upon my brother
Shakespeare,"And to my state grew stranger, being transported"
Shakespeare,And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Shakespeare,Dost thou attend me?
Shakespeare,"Sir, most heedfully."
Shakespeare,"Being once perfected how to grant suits,"
Shakespeare,"How to deny them, who to advance and who"
Shakespeare,"To trash for over-topping, new created"
Shakespeare,"The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,"
Shakespeare,"Or else new form'd 'em, having both the key"
Shakespeare,"Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state"
Shakespeare,"To what tune pleased his ear, that now he was"
Shakespeare,"The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,"
Shakespeare,And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
Shakespeare,"O, good sir, I do."
Shakespeare,"I pray thee, mark me."
Shakespeare,"I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated"
Shakespeare,To closeness and the bettering of my mind
Shakespeare,"With that which, but by being so retired,"
Shakespeare,"O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother"
Shakespeare,"Awaked an evil nature, and my trust,"
Shakespeare,"Like a good parent, did beget of him"
Shakespeare,A falsehood in its contrary as great
Shakespeare,"As my trust was, which had indeed no limit,"
Shakespeare,"A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,"
Shakespeare,"Not only with what my revenue yielded,"
Shakespeare,"But what my power might else exact, like one"
Shakespeare,"Who having into truth, by telling of it,"
Shakespeare,"Made such a sinner of his memory,"
Shakespeare,"To credit his own lie, he did believe"
Shakespeare,"He was indeed the duke, out o' the substitution"
Shakespeare,"And executing the outward face of royalty,"
Shakespeare,With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
Shakespeare,Dost thou hear?
Shakespeare,"Your tale, sir, would cure deafness."
Shakespeare,To have no screen between this part he play'd
Shakespeare,"And him he play'd it for, he needs will be"
Shakespeare,"Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library"
Shakespeare,Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
Shakespeare,"He thinks me now incapable, confederates--"
Shakespeare,So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
Shakespeare,"To give him annual tribute, do him homage,"
Shakespeare,Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
Shakespeare,"The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--"
Shakespeare,To most ignoble stooping.
Shakespeare,"Mark his condition and the event, then tell me"
Shakespeare,If this might be a brother.
Shakespeare,I should sin
Shakespeare,To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Shakespeare,Good wombs have borne bad sons.
Shakespeare,Now the condition.
Shakespeare,"The King of Naples, being an enemy"
Shakespeare,"To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit,"
Shakespeare,"Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises"
Shakespeare,"Of homage and I know not how much tribute,"
Shakespeare,Should presently extirpate me and mine
Shakespeare,Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
Shakespeare,"With all the honours on my brother: whereon,"
Shakespeare,"A treacherous army levied, one midnight"
Shakespeare,Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
Shakespeare,"The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,"
Shakespeare,The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
Shakespeare,Me and thy crying self.
Shakespeare,"Alack, for pity!"
Shakespeare,"I, not remembering how I cried out then,"
Shakespeare,Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
Shakespeare,That wrings mine eyes to't.
Shakespeare,Hear a little further
Shakespeare,And then I'll bring thee to the present business
Shakespeare,"Which now's upon's, without the which this story"
Shakespeare,Were most impertinent.
Shakespeare,Wherefore did they not
Shakespeare,That hour destroy us?
Shakespeare,"Well demanded, wench:"
Shakespeare,"My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,"
Shakespeare,"So dear the love my people bore me, nor set"
Shakespeare,"A mark so bloody on the business, but"
Shakespeare,With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
Shakespeare,"In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,"
Shakespeare,"Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared"
Shakespeare,"A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,"
Shakespeare,"Nor tackle, sail, nor mast, the very rats"
Shakespeare,"Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,"
Shakespeare,"To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh"
Shakespeare,"To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,"
Shakespeare,Did us but loving wrong.
Shakespeare,"Alack, what trouble"
Shakespeare,Was I then to you!
Shakespeare,"O, a cherubim"
Shakespeare,Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
Shakespeare,"Infused with a fortitude from heaven,"
Shakespeare,"When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,"
Shakespeare,"Under my burthen groan'd, which raised in me"
Shakespeare,"An undergoing stomach, to bear up"
Shakespeare,Against what should ensue.
Shakespeare,How came we ashore?
Shakespeare,By Providence divine.
Shakespeare,Some food we had and some fresh water that
Shakespeare,"A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,"
Shakespeare,"Out of his charity, being then appointed"
Shakespeare,"Master of this design, did give us, with"
Shakespeare,"Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,"
Shakespeare,"Which since have steaded much, so, of his gentleness,"
Shakespeare,"Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me"
Shakespeare,From mine own library with volumes that
Shakespeare,I prize above my dukedom.
Shakespeare,Would I might
Shakespeare,But ever see that man!
Shakespeare,Now I arise:
Shakespeare,Resumes his mantle
Shakespeare,"Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow."
Shakespeare,"Here in this island we arrived, and here"
Shakespeare,"Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit"
Shakespeare,Than other princesses can that have more time
Shakespeare,For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
Shakespeare,"Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,"
Shakespeare,"For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason"
Shakespeare,For raising this sea-storm?
Shakespeare,Know thus far forth.
Shakespeare,"By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,"
Shakespeare,"Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies"
Shakespeare,"Brought to this shore, and by my prescience"
Shakespeare,I find my zenith doth depend upon
Shakespeare,"A most auspicious star, whose influence"
Shakespeare,"If now I court not but omit, my fortunes"
Shakespeare,Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
Shakespeare,"Thou art inclined to sleep, 'tis a good dulness,"
Shakespeare,And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
Shakespeare,MIRANDA sleeps
Shakespeare,"Come away, servant, come. I am ready now."
Shakespeare,"Approach, my Ariel, come."
Shakespeare,Enter ARIEL
Shakespeare,Enter ARIEL
Shakespeare,Enter ARIEL
Shakespeare,"All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come"
Shakespeare,"To answer thy best pleasure, be't to fly,"
Shakespeare,"To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride"
Shakespeare,"On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task"
Shakespeare,Ariel and all his quality.
Shakespeare,"Hast thou, spirit,"
Shakespeare,Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
Shakespeare,To every article.
Shakespeare,"I boarded the king's ship, now on the beak,"
Shakespeare,"Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,"
Shakespeare,"I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,"
Shakespeare,"And burn in many places, on the topmast,"
Shakespeare,"The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,"
Shakespeare,"Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors"
Shakespeare,"O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary"
Shakespeare,"And sight-outrunning were not, the fire and cracks"
Shakespeare,Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Shakespeare,"Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,"
Shakespeare,"Yea, his dread trident shake."
Shakespeare,My brave spirit!
Shakespeare,"Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil"
Shakespeare,Would not infect his reason?
Shakespeare,Not a soul
Shakespeare,But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
Shakespeare,Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Shakespeare,"Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,"
Shakespeare,"Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,"
Shakespeare,"With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--"
Shakespeare,"Was the first man that leap'd, cried, 'Hell is empty"
Shakespeare,And all the devils are here.'
Shakespeare,Why that's my spirit!
Shakespeare,But was not this nigh shore?
Shakespeare,"Close by, my master."
Shakespeare,"But are they, Ariel, safe?"
Shakespeare,"Not a hair perish'd,"
Shakespeare,"On their sustaining garments not a blemish,"
Shakespeare,"But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,"
Shakespeare,In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
Shakespeare,"The king's son have I landed by himself,"
Shakespeare,Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
Shakespeare,"In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,"
Shakespeare,His arms in this sad knot.
Shakespeare,Of the king's ship
Shakespeare,The mariners say how thou hast disposed
Shakespeare,And all the rest o' the fleet.
Shakespeare,Safely in harbour
Shakespeare,"Is the king's ship, in the deep nook, where once"
Shakespeare,Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
Shakespeare,"From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:"
Shakespeare,"The mariners all under hatches stow'd,"
Shakespeare,"Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,"
Shakespeare,"I have left asleep, and for the rest o' the fleet"
Shakespeare,"Which I dispersed, they all have met again"
Shakespeare,"And are upon the Mediterranean flote,"
Shakespeare,"Bound sadly home for Naples,"
Shakespeare,Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
Shakespeare,And his great person perish.
Shakespeare,"Ariel, thy charge"
Shakespeare,Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
Shakespeare,What is the time o' the day?
Shakespeare,Past the mid season.
Shakespeare,At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
Shakespeare,Must by us both be spent most preciously.
Shakespeare,"Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,"
Shakespeare,"Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,"
Shakespeare,Which is not yet perform'd me.
Shakespeare,How now? moody?
Shakespeare,What is't thou canst demand?
Shakespeare,My liberty.
Shakespeare,Before the time be out? no more!
Shakespeare,"Remember I have done thee worthy service,"
Shakespeare,"Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served"
Shakespeare,Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
Shakespeare,To bate me a full year.
Shakespeare,Dost thou forget
Shakespeare,From what a torment I did free thee?
Shakespeare,"Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze"
Shakespeare,"Of the salt deep,"
Shakespeare,"To run upon the sharp wind of the north,"
Shakespeare,To do me business in the veins o' the earth
Shakespeare,When it is baked with frost.
Shakespeare,"I do not, sir."
Shakespeare,"Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot"
Shakespeare,"The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy"
Shakespeare,Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?
Shakespeare,"Thou hast. Where was she born? speak, tell me."
Shakespeare,"Sir, in Argier."
Shakespeare,"O, was she so? I must"
Shakespeare,"Once in a month recount what thou hast been,"
Shakespeare,"Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,"
Shakespeare,For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
Shakespeare,"To enter human hearing, from Argier,"
Shakespeare,"Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did"
Shakespeare,They would not take her life. Is not this true?
Shakespeare,This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
Shakespeare,"And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,"
Shakespeare,"As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant,"
Shakespeare,"And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate"
Shakespeare,"To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,"
Shakespeare,"Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,"
Shakespeare,By help of her more potent ministers
Shakespeare,"And in her most unmitigable rage,"
Shakespeare,"Into a cloven pine, within which rift"
Shakespeare,Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
Shakespeare,"A dozen years, within which space she died"
Shakespeare,"And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans"
Shakespeare,As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
Shakespeare,"Save for the son that she did litter here,"
Shakespeare,A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
Shakespeare,A human shape.
Shakespeare,"Yes, Caliban her son."
Shakespeare,"Dull thing, I say so, he, that Caliban"
Shakespeare,Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
Shakespeare,"What torment I did find thee in, thy groans"
Shakespeare,Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Shakespeare,Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
Shakespeare,"To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax"
Shakespeare,"Could not again undo: it was mine art,"
Shakespeare,"When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape"
Shakespeare,The pine and let thee out.
Shakespeare,"I thank thee, master."
Shakespeare,"If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak"
Shakespeare,And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Shakespeare,Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
Shakespeare,"Pardon, master,"
Shakespeare,I will be correspondent to command
Shakespeare,And do my spiriting gently.
Shakespeare,"Do so, and after two days"
Shakespeare,I will discharge thee.
Shakespeare,That's my noble master!
Shakespeare,"What shall I do? say what, what shall I do?"
Shakespeare,Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
Shakespeare,"To no sight but thine and mine, invisible"
Shakespeare,To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
Shakespeare,"And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!"
Shakespeare,Exit ARIEL
Shakespeare,Exit ARIEL
Shakespeare,"Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well, Awake!"
Shakespeare,The strangeness of your story put
Shakespeare,Heaviness in me.
Shakespeare,"Shake it off. Come on,"
Shakespeare,"We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never"
Shakespeare,Yields us kind answer.
Shakespeare,"'Tis a villain, sir,"
Shakespeare,I do not love to look on.
Shakespeare,"But, as 'tis,"
Shakespeare,"We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,"
Shakespeare,Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
Shakespeare,"That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!"
Shakespeare,"Thou earth, thou! speak."
Shakespeare,[Within]  There's wood enough within.
Shakespeare,"Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:"
Shakespeare,"Come, thou tortoise! when?"
Shakespeare,Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph
Shakespeare,"Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,"
Shakespeare,Hark in thine ear.
Shakespeare,My lord it shall be done.
Shakespeare,"Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself"
Shakespeare,"Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!"
Shakespeare,Enter CALIBAN
Shakespeare,As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
Shakespeare,With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Shakespeare,Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
Shakespeare,And blister you all o'er!
Shakespeare,"For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,"
Shakespeare,"Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up, urchins"
Shakespeare,"Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,"
Shakespeare,"All exercise on thee, thou shalt be pinch'd"
Shakespeare,"As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging"
Shakespeare,Than bees that made 'em.
Shakespeare,I must eat my dinner.
Shakespeare,"This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,"
Shakespeare,"Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,"
Shakespeare,"Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me"
Shakespeare,"Water with berries in't, and teach me how"
Shakespeare,"To name the bigger light, and how the less,"
Shakespeare,That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
Shakespeare,"And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,"
Shakespeare,"The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:"
Shakespeare,Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Shakespeare,"Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!"
Shakespeare,"For I am all the subjects that you have,"
Shakespeare,Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
Shakespeare,"In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me"
Shakespeare,The rest o' the island.
Shakespeare,"Thou most lying slave,"
Shakespeare,"Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,"
Shakespeare,"Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee"
Shakespeare,"In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate"
Shakespeare,The honour of my child.
Shakespeare,"O ho, O ho! would't had been done!"
Shakespeare,"Thou didst prevent me, I had peopled else"
Shakespeare,This isle with Calibans.
Shakespeare,"Abhorred slave,"
Shakespeare,"Which any print of goodness wilt not take,"
Shakespeare,"Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,"
Shakespeare,"Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour"
Shakespeare,"One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,"
Shakespeare,"Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like"
Shakespeare,"A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes"
Shakespeare,"With words that made them known. But thy vile race,"
Shakespeare,"Though thou didst learn, had that in't which"
Shakespeare,good natures
Shakespeare,"Could not abide to be with, therefore wast thou"
Shakespeare,"Deservedly confined into this rock,"
Shakespeare,Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
Shakespeare,"You taught me language, and my profit on't"
Shakespeare,"Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you"
Shakespeare,For learning me your language!
Shakespeare,"Hag-seed, hence!"
Shakespeare,"Fetch us in fuel, and be quick, thou'rt best,"
Shakespeare,"To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?"
Shakespeare,If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
Shakespeare,"What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,"
Shakespeare,"Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar"
Shakespeare,That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
Shakespeare,"No, pray thee."
Shakespeare,"I must obey: his art is of such power,"
Shakespeare,"It would control my dam's god, Setebos,"
Shakespeare,and make a vassal of him.
Shakespeare,"So, slave, hence!"
Shakespeare,Exit CALIBAN
Shakespeare,"Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing, FERDINAND following"
Shakespeare,ARIEL'S song.
Shakespeare,"Come unto these yellow sands,"
Shakespeare,And then take hands:
Shakespeare,Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
Shakespeare,"The wild waves whist,"
Shakespeare,"Foot it featly here and there,"
Shakespeare,"And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear."
Shakespeare,"Hark, hark!"
Shakespeare,"Hark, hark!"
Shakespeare,"Burthen [dispersedly, within"
Shakespeare,The watch-dogs bark!
Shakespeare,Burthen Bow-wow
Shakespeare,"Hark, hark! I hear"
Shakespeare,The strain of strutting chanticleer
Shakespeare,"Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow."
Shakespeare,Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
Shakespeare,"It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon"
Shakespeare,"Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,"
Shakespeare,"Weeping again the king my father's wreck,"
Shakespeare,"This music crept by me upon the waters,"
Shakespeare,Allaying both their fury and my passion
Shakespeare,"With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,"
Shakespeare,Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
Shakespeare,"No, it begins again."
Shakespeare,ARIEL sings
Shakespeare,"Full fathom five thy father lies,"
Shakespeare,"Of his bones are coral made,"
Shakespeare,Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Shakespeare,Nothing of him that doth fade
Shakespeare,But doth suffer a sea-change
Shakespeare,Into something rich and strange.
Shakespeare,Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
Shakespeare,Burthen Ding-dong
Shakespeare,"Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell."
Shakespeare,The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
Shakespeare,"This is no mortal business, nor no sound"
Shakespeare,That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
Shakespeare,The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
Shakespeare,And say what thou seest yond.
Shakespeare,What is't? a spirit?
Shakespeare,"Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,"
Shakespeare,It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
Shakespeare,"No, wench, it eats and sleeps and hath such senses"
Shakespeare,"As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest"
Shakespeare,"Was in the wreck, and, but he's something stain'd"
Shakespeare,"With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him"
Shakespeare,A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
Shakespeare,And strays about to find 'em.
Shakespeare,I might call him
Shakespeare,"A thing divine, for nothing natural"
Shakespeare,I ever saw so noble.
Shakespeare,"[Aside] It goes on, I see,"
Shakespeare,"As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee"
Shakespeare,Within two days for this.
Shakespeare,"Most sure, the goddess"
Shakespeare,On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
Shakespeare,"May know if you remain upon this island,"
Shakespeare,And that you will some good instruction give
Shakespeare,"How I may bear me here: my prime request,"
Shakespeare,"Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!"
Shakespeare,If you be maid or no?
Shakespeare,"No wonder, sir,"
Shakespeare,But certainly a maid.
Shakespeare,My language! heavens!
Shakespeare,"I am the best of them that speak this speech,"
Shakespeare,Were I but where 'tis spoken.
Shakespeare,How? the best?
Shakespeare,"What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?"
Shakespeare,"A single thing, as I am now, that wonders"
Shakespeare,"To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me,"
Shakespeare,"And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,"
Shakespeare,"Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld"
Shakespeare,The king my father wreck'd.
Shakespeare,"Alack, for mercy!"
Shakespeare,"Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan"
Shakespeare,And his brave son being twain.
Shakespeare,[Aside]	The Duke of Milan
Shakespeare,"And his more braver daughter could control thee,"
Shakespeare,If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
Shakespeare,"They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,"
Shakespeare,I'll set thee free for this.
Shakespeare,To FERDINAND
Shakespeare,To FERDINAND
Shakespeare,To FERDINAND
Shakespeare,To FERDINAND
Shakespeare,"A word, good sir,"
Shakespeare,I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.
Shakespeare,Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Shakespeare,"Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first"
Shakespeare,That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
Shakespeare,To be inclined my way!
Shakespeare,"O, if a virgin,"
Shakespeare,"And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you"
Shakespeare,The queen of Naples.
Shakespeare,"Soft, sir! one word more."
Shakespeare,"They are both in either's powers, but this swift business"
Shakespeare,"I must uneasy make, lest too light winning"
Shakespeare,Make the prize light.
Shakespeare,"One word more, I charge thee"
Shakespeare,That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
Shakespeare,"The name thou owest not, and hast put thyself"
Shakespeare,"Upon this island as a spy, to win it"
Shakespeare,"From me, the lord on't."
Shakespeare,"No, as I am a man."
Shakespeare,There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
Shakespeare,"If the ill spirit have so fair a house,"
Shakespeare,Good things will strive to dwell with't.
Shakespeare,Follow me.
Shakespeare,Follow me.
Shakespeare,"Speak not you for him, he's a traitor. Come,"
Shakespeare,I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
Shakespeare,"Sea-water shalt thou drink, thy food shall be"
Shakespeare,"The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks"
Shakespeare,Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
Shakespeare,I will resist such entertainment till
Shakespeare,Mine enemy has more power.
Shakespeare,"Draws, and is charmed from moving"
Shakespeare,"O dear father,"
Shakespeare,"Make not too rash a trial of him, for"
Shakespeare,He's gentle and not fearful.
Shakespeare,"What? I say,"
Shakespeare,"My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor,"
Shakespeare,"Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience"
Shakespeare,"Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,"
Shakespeare,For I can here disarm thee with this stick
Shakespeare,And make thy weapon drop.
Shakespeare,"Beseech you, father."
Shakespeare,Hence! hang not on my garments.
Shakespeare,"Sir, have pity,"
Shakespeare,I'll be his surety.
Shakespeare,Silence! one word more
Shakespeare,"Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!"
Shakespeare,An advocate for an imposter! hush!
Shakespeare,"Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,"
Shakespeare,Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
Shakespeare,To the most of men this is a Caliban
Shakespeare,And they to him are angels.
Shakespeare,My affections
Shakespeare,"Are then most humble, I have no ambition"
Shakespeare,To see a goodlier man.
Shakespeare,"Come on, obey:"
Shakespeare,Thy nerves are in their infancy again
Shakespeare,And have no vigour in them.
Shakespeare,"So they are,"
Shakespeare,"My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up."
Shakespeare,"My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,"
Shakespeare,"The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,"
Shakespeare,"To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,"
Shakespeare,Might I but through my prison once a day
Shakespeare,Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
Shakespeare,"Let liberty make use of, space enough"
Shakespeare,Have I in such a prison.
Shakespeare,[Aside]                It works.
Shakespeare,Come on.
Shakespeare,"Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!"
Shakespeare,To ARIEL
Shakespeare,Hark what thou else shalt do me.
Shakespeare,"Be of comfort,"
Shakespeare,"My father's of a better nature, sir,"
Shakespeare,Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
Shakespeare,Which now came from him.
Shakespeare,Thou shalt be free
Shakespeare,As mountain winds: but then exactly do
Shakespeare,All points of my command.
Shakespeare,To the syllable.
Shakespeare,"Come, follow. Speak not for him."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Another part of the island.
Shakespeare,"Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others"
Shakespeare,"Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others"
Shakespeare,"Beseech you, sir, be merry, you have cause,"
Shakespeare,"So have we all, of joy, for our escape"
Shakespeare,Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Shakespeare,"Is common, every day some sailor's wife,"
Shakespeare,The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Shakespeare,"Have just our theme of woe, but for the miracle,"
Shakespeare,"I mean our preservation, few in millions"
Shakespeare,"Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh"
Shakespeare,Our sorrow with our comfort.
Shakespeare,He receives comfort like cold porridge.
Shakespeare,The visitor will not give him o'er so.
Shakespeare,"Look he's winding up the watch of his wit,"
Shakespeare,by and by it will strike.
Shakespeare,"Sir,--"
Shakespeare,One: tell.
Shakespeare,"When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,"
Shakespeare,Comes to the entertainer--
Shakespeare,A dollar.
Shakespeare,"Dolour comes to him, indeed: you"
Shakespeare,have spoken truer than you purposed.
Shakespeare,You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
Shakespeare,"Therefore, my lord,--"
Shakespeare,"Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!"
Shakespeare,"I prithee, spare."
Shakespeare,"Well, I have done: but yet,--"
Shakespeare,He will be talking.
Shakespeare,"Which, of he or Adrian, for a good"
Shakespeare,"wager, first begins to crow?"
Shakespeare,The old cock.
Shakespeare,The cockerel.
Shakespeare,Done. The wager?
Shakespeare,A laughter.
Shakespeare,A match!
Shakespeare,"Though this island seem to be desert,--"
Shakespeare,"Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid."
Shakespeare,"Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--"
Shakespeare,"Yet,--"
Shakespeare,"Yet,--"
Shakespeare,He could not miss't.
Shakespeare,"It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate"
Shakespeare,temperance.
Shakespeare,Temperance was a delicate wench.
Shakespeare,"Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly delivered."
Shakespeare,The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
Shakespeare,As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
Shakespeare,Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
Shakespeare,Here is everything advantageous to life.
Shakespeare,"True, save means to live."
Shakespeare,"Of that there's none, or little."
Shakespeare,How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
Shakespeare,The ground indeed is tawny.
Shakespeare,With an eye of green in't.
Shakespeare,He misses not much.
Shakespeare,"No, he doth but mistake the truth totally."
Shakespeare,"But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost"
Shakespeare,"beyond credit,--"
Shakespeare,As many vouched rarities are.
Shakespeare,"That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in"
Shakespeare,"the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and"
Shakespeare,"glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with"
Shakespeare,salt water.
Shakespeare,"If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not"
Shakespeare,say he lies?
Shakespeare,"Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report"
Shakespeare,Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
Shakespeare,"put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of"
Shakespeare,the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
Shakespeare,"'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return."
Shakespeare,Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
Shakespeare,their queen.
Shakespeare,Not since widow Dido's time.
Shakespeare,Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
Shakespeare,widow Dido!
Shakespeare,"What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,"
Shakespeare,how you take it!
Shakespeare,'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
Shakespeare,"she was of Carthage, not of Tunis."
Shakespeare,"This Tunis, sir, was Carthage."
Shakespeare,Carthage?
Shakespeare,"I assure you, Carthage."
Shakespeare,"His word is more than the miraculous harp, he hath"
Shakespeare,raised the wall and houses too.
Shakespeare,What impossible matter will he make easy next?
Shakespeare,I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
Shakespeare,and give it his son for an apple.
Shakespeare,"And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring"
Shakespeare,forth more islands.
Shakespeare,"Why, in good time."
Shakespeare,"Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now"
Shakespeare,as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
Shakespeare,"of your daughter, who is now queen."
Shakespeare,And the rarest that e'er came there.
Shakespeare,"Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido."
Shakespeare,"O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido."
Shakespeare,"Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I"
Shakespeare,"wore it? I mean, in a sort."
Shakespeare,That sort was well fished for.
Shakespeare,When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
Shakespeare,You cram these words into mine ears against
Shakespeare,The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Shakespeare,"Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,"
Shakespeare,"My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,"
Shakespeare,Who is so far from Italy removed
Shakespeare,I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Shakespeare,"Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish"
Shakespeare,Hath made his meal on thee?
Shakespeare,"Sir, he may live:"
Shakespeare,"I saw him beat the surges under him,"
Shakespeare,"And ride upon their backs, he trod the water,"
Shakespeare,"Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted"
Shakespeare,"The surge most swoln that met him, his bold head"
Shakespeare,"'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd"
Shakespeare,Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
Shakespeare,"To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,"
Shakespeare,As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
Shakespeare,He came alive to land.
Shakespeare,"No, no, he's gone."
Shakespeare,"Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,"
Shakespeare,"That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,"
Shakespeare,"But rather lose her to an African,"
Shakespeare,"Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,"
Shakespeare,Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
Shakespeare,You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
Shakespeare,"By all of us, and the fair soul herself"
Shakespeare,"Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at"
Shakespeare,Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
Shakespeare,"son,"
Shakespeare,"I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have"
Shakespeare,More widows in them of this business' making
Shakespeare,Than we bring men to comfort them:
Shakespeare,The fault's your own.
Shakespeare,So is the dear'st o' the loss.
Shakespeare,"My lord Sebastian,"
Shakespeare,The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
Shakespeare,"And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,"
Shakespeare,When you should bring the plaster.
Shakespeare,And most chirurgeonly.
Shakespeare,"It is foul weather in us all, good sir,"
Shakespeare,When you are cloudy.
Shakespeare,Foul weather?
Shakespeare,Very foul.
Shakespeare,"Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--"
Shakespeare,He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
Shakespeare,"Or docks, or mallows."
Shakespeare,"And were the king on't, what would I do?"
Shakespeare,'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
Shakespeare,I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
Shakespeare,"Execute all things, for no kind of traffic"
Shakespeare,"Would I admit, no name of magistrate,"
Shakespeare,"Letters should not be known, riches, poverty,"
Shakespeare,"And use of service, none, contract, succession,"
Shakespeare,"Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none,"
Shakespeare,"No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil,"
Shakespeare,"No occupation, all men idle, all,"
Shakespeare,"And women too, but innocent and pure,"
Shakespeare,"No sovereignty,--"
Shakespeare,Yet he would be king on't.
Shakespeare,The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
Shakespeare,beginning.
Shakespeare,All things in common nature should produce
Shakespeare,"Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,"
Shakespeare,"Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,"
Shakespeare,"Would I not have, but nature should bring forth,"
Shakespeare,"Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,"
Shakespeare,To feed my innocent people.
Shakespeare,No marrying 'mong his subjects?
Shakespeare,"None, man, all idle: whores and knaves."
Shakespeare,"I would with such perfection govern, sir,"
Shakespeare,To excel the golden age.
Shakespeare,God save his majesty!
Shakespeare,Long live Gonzalo!
Shakespeare,"And,--do you mark me, sir?"
Shakespeare,"Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me."
Shakespeare,"I do well believe your highness, and"
Shakespeare,"did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,"
Shakespeare,who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
Shakespeare,they always use to laugh at nothing.
Shakespeare,'Twas you we laughed at.
Shakespeare,Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
Shakespeare,to you: so you may continue and laugh at
Shakespeare,nothing still.
Shakespeare,What a blow was there given!
Shakespeare,An it had not fallen flat-long.
Shakespeare,"You are gentlemen of brave metal, you would lift"
Shakespeare,"the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue"
Shakespeare,in it five weeks without changing.
Shakespeare,"Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music"
Shakespeare,"We would so, and then go a bat-fowling."
Shakespeare,"Nay, good my lord, be not angry."
Shakespeare,"No, I warrant you, I will not adventure"
Shakespeare,my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
Shakespeare,"me asleep, for I am very heavy?"
Shakespeare,"Go sleep, and hear us."
Shakespeare,"All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO"
Shakespeare,"What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes"
Shakespeare,"Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find"
Shakespeare,They are inclined to do so.
Shakespeare,Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
Shakespeare,"It seldom visits sorrow, when it doth,"
Shakespeare,It is a comforter.
Shakespeare,"We two, my lord,"
Shakespeare,"Will guard your person while you take your rest,"
Shakespeare,And watch your safety.
Shakespeare,Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
Shakespeare,ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL
Shakespeare,What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
Shakespeare,It is the quality o' the climate.
Shakespeare,Why
Shakespeare,Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
Shakespeare,Myself disposed to sleep.
Shakespeare,"Nor I, my spirits are nimble."
Shakespeare,"They fell together all, as by consent,"
Shakespeare,"They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,"
Shakespeare,"Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--"
Shakespeare,"And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,"
Shakespeare,"What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and"
Shakespeare,My strong imagination sees a crown
Shakespeare,Dropping upon thy head.
Shakespeare,"What, art thou waking?"
Shakespeare,Do you not hear me speak?
Shakespeare,"I do, and surely"
Shakespeare,It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
Shakespeare,Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
Shakespeare,"This is a strange repose, to be asleep"
Shakespeare,"With eyes wide open, standing, speaking, moving,"
Shakespeare,And yet so fast asleep.
Shakespeare,"Noble Sebastian,"
Shakespeare,"Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather, wink'st"
Shakespeare,Whiles thou art waking.
Shakespeare,"Thou dost snore distinctly,"
Shakespeare,There's meaning in thy snores.
Shakespeare,I am more serious than my custom: you
Shakespeare,"Must be so too, if heed me, which to do"
Shakespeare,Trebles thee o'er.
Shakespeare,"Well, I am standing water."
Shakespeare,I'll teach you how to flow.
Shakespeare,Do so: to ebb
Shakespeare,Hereditary sloth instructs me.
Shakespeare,If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
Shakespeare,"Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,"
Shakespeare,"You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,"
Shakespeare,Most often do so near the bottom run
Shakespeare,By their own fear or sloth.
Shakespeare,"Prithee, say on:"
Shakespeare,The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
Shakespeare,"A matter from thee, and a birth indeed"
Shakespeare,Which throes thee much to yield.
Shakespeare,"Thus, sir:"
Shakespeare,"Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,"
Shakespeare,Who shall be of as little memory
Shakespeare,"When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--"
Shakespeare,"For he's a spirit of persuasion, only"
Shakespeare,"Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,"
Shakespeare,'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
Shakespeare,And he that sleeps here swims.
Shakespeare,I have no hope
Shakespeare,That he's undrown'd.
Shakespeare,"O, out of that 'no hope'"
Shakespeare,What great hope have you! no hope that way is
Shakespeare,Another way so high a hope that even
Shakespeare,"Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,"
Shakespeare,But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
Shakespeare,That Ferdinand is drown'd?
Shakespeare,He's gone.
Shakespeare,"Then, tell me,"
Shakespeare,Who's the next heir of Naples?
Shakespeare,Claribel.
Shakespeare,"She that is queen of Tunis, she that dwells"
Shakespeare,"Ten leagues beyond man's life, she that from Naples"
Shakespeare,"Can have no note, unless the sun were post--"
Shakespeare,The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
Shakespeare,"Be rough and razorable, she that--from whom?"
Shakespeare,"We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,"
Shakespeare,And by that destiny to perform an act
Shakespeare,"Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come"
Shakespeare,In yours and my discharge.
Shakespeare,What stuff is this! how say you?
Shakespeare,"'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis,"
Shakespeare,"So is she heir of Naples, 'twixt which regions"
Shakespeare,There is some space.
Shakespeare,A space whose every cubit
Shakespeare,"Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel"
Shakespeare,"Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,"
Shakespeare,"And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death"
Shakespeare,"That now hath seized them, why, they were no worse"
Shakespeare,Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
Shakespeare,"As well as he that sleeps, lords that can prate"
Shakespeare,As amply and unnecessarily
Shakespeare,"As this Gonzalo, I myself could make"
Shakespeare,"A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore"
Shakespeare,The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
Shakespeare,For your advancement! Do you understand me?
Shakespeare,Methinks I do.
Shakespeare,And how does your content
Shakespeare,Tender your own good fortune?
Shakespeare,You did supplant your brother Prospero.
Shakespeare,True:
Shakespeare,"And look how well my garments sit upon me,"
Shakespeare,Much feater than before: my brother's servants
Shakespeare,"Were then my fellows, now they are my men."
Shakespeare,"But, for your conscience?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, sir, where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,"
Shakespeare,'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
Shakespeare,"This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,"
Shakespeare,"That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they"
Shakespeare,"And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,"
Shakespeare,"No better than the earth he lies upon,"
Shakespeare,"If he were that which now he's like, that's dead,"
Shakespeare,"Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,"
Shakespeare,"Can lay to bed for ever, whiles you, doing thus,"
Shakespeare,To the perpetual wink for aye might put
Shakespeare,"This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who"
Shakespeare,"Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,"
Shakespeare,"They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk,"
Shakespeare,They'll tell the clock to any business that
Shakespeare,We say befits the hour.
Shakespeare,"Thy case, dear friend,"
Shakespeare,"Shall be my precedent, as thou got'st Milan,"
Shakespeare,I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
Shakespeare,"Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,"
Shakespeare,And I the king shall love thee.
Shakespeare,"Draw together,"
Shakespeare,"And when I rear my hand, do you the like,"
Shakespeare,To fall it on Gonzalo.
Shakespeare,"O, but one word."
Shakespeare,They talk apart
Shakespeare,"Re-enter ARIEL, invisible"
Shakespeare,My master through his art foresees the danger
Shakespeare,"That you, his friend, are in, and sends me forth--"
Shakespeare,For else his project dies--to keep them living.
Shakespeare,Sings in GONZALO's ear
Shakespeare,"While you here do snoring lie,"
Shakespeare,Open-eyed conspiracy
Shakespeare,His time doth take.
Shakespeare,"If of life you keep a care,"
Shakespeare,"Shake off slumber, and beware:"
Shakespeare,Then let us both be sudden.
Shakespeare,"Now, good angels"
Shakespeare,Preserve the king.
Shakespeare,They wake
Shakespeare,"Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?"
Shakespeare,Wherefore this ghastly looking?
Shakespeare,"Whiles we stood here securing your repose,"
Shakespeare,"Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing"
Shakespeare,"Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?"
Shakespeare,It struck mine ear most terribly.
Shakespeare,I heard nothing.
Shakespeare,"O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,"
Shakespeare,"To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar"
Shakespeare,Of a whole herd of lions.
Shakespeare,"Heard you this, Gonzalo?"
Shakespeare,"Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,"
Shakespeare,"And that a strange one too, which did awake me:"
Shakespeare,"I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,"
Shakespeare,"I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,"
Shakespeare,"That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,"
Shakespeare,"Or that we quit this place, let's draw our weapons."
Shakespeare,"Lead off this ground, and let's make further search"
Shakespeare,For my poor son.
Shakespeare,Heavens keep him from these beasts!
Shakespeare,"For he is, sure, i' the island."
Shakespeare,Lead away.
Shakespeare,Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
Shakespeare,"So, king, go safely on to seek thy son."
Shakespeare,SCENE II. Another part of the island.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. Another part of the island.
Shakespeare,Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard
Shakespeare,All the infections that the sun sucks up
Shakespeare,"From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him"
Shakespeare,By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
Shakespeare,"And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,"
Shakespeare,"Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,"
Shakespeare,"Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark"
Shakespeare,"Out of my way, unless he bid 'em, but"
Shakespeare,"For every trifle are they set upon me,"
Shakespeare,Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
Shakespeare,"And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which"
Shakespeare,Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
Shakespeare,"Their pricks at my footfall, sometime am I"
Shakespeare,All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
Shakespeare,Do hiss me into madness.
Shakespeare,Enter TRINCULO
Shakespeare,"Lo, now, lo!"
Shakespeare,"Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me"
Shakespeare,"For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat,"
Shakespeare,Perchance he will not mind me.
Shakespeare,"Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off"
Shakespeare,"any weather at all, and another storm brewing,"
Shakespeare,I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black
Shakespeare,"cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul"
Shakespeare,bombard that would shed his liquor. If it
Shakespeare,"should thunder as it did before, I know not"
Shakespeare,where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
Shakespeare,choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
Shakespeare,here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:
Shakespeare,"he smells like a fish, a very ancient and fish-"
Shakespeare,"like smell, a kind of not of the newest Poor-"
Shakespeare,"John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,"
Shakespeare,"as once I was, and had but this fish painted,"
Shakespeare,not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
Shakespeare,of silver: there would this monster make a
Shakespeare,"man, any strange beast there makes a man:"
Shakespeare,when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
Shakespeare,"beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead"
Shakespeare,Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
Shakespeare,arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose
Shakespeare,"my opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish,"
Shakespeare,"but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a"
Shakespeare,thunderbolt.
Shakespeare,"Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to"
Shakespeare,"creep under his gaberdine, there is no other"
Shakespeare,shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
Shakespeare,strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
Shakespeare,dregs of the storm be past.
Shakespeare,"Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand"
Shakespeare,"I shall no more to sea, to sea,"
Shakespeare,Here shall I die ashore--
Shakespeare,This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's
Shakespeare,"funeral: well, here's my comfort."
Shakespeare,"The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,"
Shakespeare,The gunner and his mate
Shakespeare,"Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,"
Shakespeare,"But none of us cared for Kate,"
Shakespeare,"For she had a tongue with a tang,"
Shakespeare,"Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!"
Shakespeare,"She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,"
Shakespeare,Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:
Shakespeare,"Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!"
Shakespeare,This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.
Shakespeare,Do not torment me: Oh!
Shakespeare,What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put
Shakespeare,"tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I"
Shakespeare,have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your
Shakespeare,"four legs, for it hath been said, As proper a man as"
Shakespeare,"ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground,"
Shakespeare,and it shall be said so again while Stephano
Shakespeare,breathes at's nostrils.
Shakespeare,"The spirit torments me, Oh!"
Shakespeare,"This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who"
Shakespeare,"hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil"
Shakespeare,should he learn our language? I will give him some
Shakespeare,"relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him"
Shakespeare,"and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a"
Shakespeare,present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.
Shakespeare,"Do not torment me, prithee, I'll bring my wood home faster."
Shakespeare,He's in his fit now and does not talk after the
Shakespeare,wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have
Shakespeare,never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his
Shakespeare,"fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will"
Shakespeare,"not take too much for him, he shall pay for him that"
Shakespeare,"hath him, and that soundly."
Shakespeare,"Thou dost me yet but little hurt, thou wilt anon, I"
Shakespeare,know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.
Shakespeare,"Come on your ways, open your mouth, here is that"
Shakespeare,"which will give language to you, cat: open your"
Shakespeare,"mouth, this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,"
Shakespeare,and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:
Shakespeare,open your chaps again.
Shakespeare,I should know that voice: it should be--but he is
Shakespeare,"drowned, and these are devils: O defend me!"
Shakespeare,Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!
Shakespeare,His forward voice now is to speak well of his
Shakespeare,"friend, his backward voice is to utter foul speeches"
Shakespeare,and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will
Shakespeare,"recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I"
Shakespeare,will pour some in thy other mouth.
Shakespeare,Stephano!
Shakespeare,"Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is"
Shakespeare,"a devil, and no monster: I will leave him, I have no"
Shakespeare,"Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and"
Shakespeare,speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy
Shakespeare,good friend Trinculo.
Shakespeare,"If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee"
Shakespeare,"by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,"
Shakespeare,these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How
Shakespeare,camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can
Shakespeare,he vent Trinculos?
Shakespeare,I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But
Shakespeare,"art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art"
Shakespeare,not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
Shakespeare,under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of
Shakespeare,"the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O"
Shakespeare,"Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!"
Shakespeare,"Prithee, do not turn me about, my stomach is not constant."
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  These be fine things, an if they be"
Shakespeare,not sprites.
Shakespeare,That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
Shakespeare,I will kneel to him.
Shakespeare,How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
Shakespeare,swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
Shakespeare,escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
Shakespeare,"heaved o'erboard, by this bottle, which I made of"
Shakespeare,the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
Shakespeare,cast ashore.
Shakespeare,"I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject,"
Shakespeare,for the liquor is not earthly.
Shakespeare,"Here, swear then how thou escapedst."
Shakespeare,"Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a"
Shakespeare,"duck, I'll be sworn."
Shakespeare,"Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a"
Shakespeare,"duck, thou art made like a goose."
Shakespeare,O Stephano. hast any more of this?
Shakespeare,"The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the"
Shakespeare,"sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!"
Shakespeare,how does thine ague?
Shakespeare,Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
Shakespeare,"Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'"
Shakespeare,the moon when time was.
Shakespeare,I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:
Shakespeare,My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.
Shakespeare,"Come, swear to that, kiss the book: I will furnish"
Shakespeare,it anon with new contents swear.
Shakespeare,"By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!"
Shakespeare,I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'
Shakespeare,the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
Shakespeare,"drawn, monster, in good sooth!"
Shakespeare,"I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island,"
Shakespeare,"And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god."
Shakespeare,"By this light, a most perfidious and drunken"
Shakespeare,"monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle."
Shakespeare,"I'll kiss thy foot, I'll swear myself thy subject."
Shakespeare,"Come on then, down, and swear."
Shakespeare,I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
Shakespeare,monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my
Shakespeare,"heart to beat him,--"
Shakespeare,"Come, kiss."
Shakespeare,But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!
Shakespeare,"I'll show thee the best springs, I'll pluck thee berries,"
Shakespeare,I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
Shakespeare,A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
Shakespeare,"I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,"
Shakespeare,Thou wondrous man.
Shakespeare,"A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a"
Shakespeare,Poor drunkard!
Shakespeare,"I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow,"
Shakespeare,"And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts,"
Shakespeare,Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
Shakespeare,"To snare the nimble marmoset, I'll bring thee"
Shakespeare,To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
Shakespeare,Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?
Shakespeare,"I prithee now, lead the way without any more"
Shakespeare,"talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company"
Shakespeare,"else being drowned, we will inherit here: here,"
Shakespeare,"bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by"
Shakespeare,and by again.
Shakespeare,[Sings drunkenly]
Shakespeare,"Farewell master, farewell, farewell!"
Shakespeare,A howling monster: a drunken monster!
Shakespeare,No more dams I'll make for fish
Shakespeare,Nor fetch in firing
Shakespeare,"At requiring,"
Shakespeare,"Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish"
Shakespeare,"'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban"
Shakespeare,Has a new master: get a new man.
Shakespeare,"Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,"
Shakespeare,"hey-day, freedom!"
Shakespeare,O brave monster! Lead the way.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S Cell.
Shakespeare,"Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log"
Shakespeare,"There be some sports are painful, and their labour"
Shakespeare,Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
Shakespeare,Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
Shakespeare,Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Shakespeare,"Would be as heavy to me as odious, but"
Shakespeare,The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
Shakespeare,"And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is"
Shakespeare,"Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,"
Shakespeare,And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
Shakespeare,"Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,"
Shakespeare,Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
Shakespeare,"Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness"
Shakespeare,Had never like executor. I forget:
Shakespeare,"But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,"
Shakespeare,"Most busy lest, when I do it."
Shakespeare,"Enter MIRANDA, and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen"
Shakespeare,"Alas, now, pray you,"
Shakespeare,Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
Shakespeare,Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
Shakespeare,"Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,"
Shakespeare,'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
Shakespeare,"Is hard at study, pray now, rest yourself,"
Shakespeare,He's safe for these three hours.
Shakespeare,"O most dear mistress,"
Shakespeare,The sun will set before I shall discharge
Shakespeare,What I must strive to do.
Shakespeare,"If you'll sit down,"
Shakespeare,"I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that,"
Shakespeare,I'll carry it to the pile.
Shakespeare,"No, precious creature,"
Shakespeare,"I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,"
Shakespeare,"Than you should such dishonour undergo,"
Shakespeare,While I sit lazy by.
Shakespeare,It would become me
Shakespeare,As well as it does you: and I should do it
Shakespeare,"With much more ease, for my good will is to it,"
Shakespeare,And yours it is against.
Shakespeare,"Poor worm, thou art infected!"
Shakespeare,This visitation shows it.
Shakespeare,You look wearily.
Shakespeare,"No, noble mistress,'tis fresh morning with me"
Shakespeare,When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
Shakespeare,Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
Shakespeare,"Miranda.--O my father,"
Shakespeare,I have broke your hest to say so!
Shakespeare,Admired Miranda!
Shakespeare,Indeed the top of admiration! worth
Shakespeare,What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
Shakespeare,I have eyed with best regard and many a time
Shakespeare,The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Shakespeare,Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
Shakespeare,"Have I liked several women, never any"
Shakespeare,"With so fun soul, but some defect in her"
Shakespeare,Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
Shakespeare,"And put it to the foil: but you, O you,"
Shakespeare,"So perfect and so peerless, are created"
Shakespeare,Of every creature's best!
Shakespeare,"One of my sex, no woman's face remember,"
Shakespeare,"Save, from my glass, mine own, nor have I seen"
Shakespeare,"More that I may call men than you, good friend,"
Shakespeare,"And my dear father: how features are abroad,"
Shakespeare,"I am skilless of, but, by my modesty,"
Shakespeare,"The jewel in my dower, I would not wish"
Shakespeare,"Any companion in the world but you,"
Shakespeare,"Nor can imagination form a shape,"
Shakespeare,"Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle"
Shakespeare,Something too wildly and my father's precepts
Shakespeare,I therein do forget.
Shakespeare,I am in my condition
Shakespeare,"A prince, Miranda, I do think, a king,"
Shakespeare,"I would, not so!--and would no more endure"
Shakespeare,This wooden slavery than to suffer
Shakespeare,The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
Shakespeare,"The very instant that I saw you, did"
Shakespeare,"My heart fly to your service, there resides,"
Shakespeare,"To make me slave to it, and for your sake"
Shakespeare,Am I this patient log--man.
Shakespeare,Do you love me?
Shakespeare,"O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound"
Shakespeare,And crown what I profess with kind event
Shakespeare,"If I speak true! if hollowly, invert"
Shakespeare,What best is boded me to mischief! I
Shakespeare,Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
Shakespeare,"Do love, prize, honour you."
Shakespeare,I am a fool
Shakespeare,To weep at what I am glad of.
Shakespeare,Fair encounter
Shakespeare,Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
Shakespeare,On that which breeds between 'em!
Shakespeare,Wherefore weep you?
Shakespeare,At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
Shakespeare,"What I desire to give, and much less take"
Shakespeare,"What I shall die to want. But this is trifling,"
Shakespeare,"And all the more it seeks to hide itself,"
Shakespeare,"The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!"
Shakespeare,"And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!"
Shakespeare,"I am your wife, if you will marry me,"
Shakespeare,"If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow"
Shakespeare,"You may deny me, but I'll be your servant,"
Shakespeare,Whether you will or no.
Shakespeare,"My mistress, dearest,"
Shakespeare,And I thus humble ever.
Shakespeare,"My husband, then?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, with a heart as willing"
Shakespeare,As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.
Shakespeare,"And mine, with my heart in't, and now farewell"
Shakespeare,Till half an hour hence.
Shakespeare,A thousand thousand!
Shakespeare,Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally
Shakespeare,"So glad of this as they I cannot be,"
Shakespeare,"Who are surprised withal, but my rejoicing"
Shakespeare,"At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,"
Shakespeare,For yet ere supper-time must I perform
Shakespeare,Much business appertaining.
Shakespeare,"Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO"
Shakespeare,"Tell not me, when the butt is out, we will drink"
Shakespeare,"water, not a drop before: therefore bear up, and"
Shakespeare,"board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me."
Shakespeare,Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They
Shakespeare,say there's but five upon this isle: we are three
Shakespeare,"of them, if th' other two be brained like us, the"
Shakespeare,state totters.
Shakespeare,"Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes"
Shakespeare,are almost set in thy head.
Shakespeare,Where should they be set else? he were a brave
Shakespeare,"monster indeed, if they were set in his tail."
Shakespeare,My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
Shakespeare,"for my part, the sea cannot drown me, I swam, ere I"
Shakespeare,"could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off"
Shakespeare,"and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,"
Shakespeare,"monster, or my standard."
Shakespeare,"Your lieutenant, if you list, he's no standard."
Shakespeare,"We'll not run, Monsieur Monster."
Shakespeare,"Nor go neither, but you'll lie like dogs and yet say"
Shakespeare,nothing neither.
Shakespeare,"Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a"
Shakespeare,good moon-calf.
Shakespeare,How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
Shakespeare,"I'll not serve him, he's not valiant."
Shakespeare,"Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to"
Shakespeare,"justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,"
Shakespeare,was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much
Shakespeare,"sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,"
Shakespeare,being but half a fish and half a monster?
Shakespeare,"Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?"
Shakespeare,'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!
Shakespeare,"Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee."
Shakespeare,"Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you"
Shakespeare,"prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's"
Shakespeare,my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.
Shakespeare,I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to
Shakespeare,hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
Shakespeare,"Marry, will I	kneel and repeat it, I will stand,"
Shakespeare,and so shall Trinculo.
Shakespeare,"Enter ARIEL, invisible"
Shakespeare,"As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a"
Shakespeare,"sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island."
Shakespeare,"Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my"
Shakespeare,valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.
Shakespeare,"Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by"
Shakespeare,"this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth."
Shakespeare,"Why, I said nothing."
Shakespeare,"Mum, then, and no more. Proceed."
Shakespeare,"I say, by sorcery he got this isle,"
Shakespeare,From me he got it. if thy greatness will
Shakespeare,"Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,"
Shakespeare,"But this thing dare not,--"
Shakespeare,That's most certain.
Shakespeare,Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.
Shakespeare,How now shall this be compassed?
Shakespeare,Canst thou bring me to the party?
Shakespeare,"Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,"
Shakespeare,Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.
Shakespeare,"Thou liest, thou canst not."
Shakespeare,What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
Shakespeare,"I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows"
Shakespeare,And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
Shakespeare,"He shall drink nought but brine, for I'll not show him"
Shakespeare,Where the quick freshes are.
Shakespeare,"Trinculo, run into no further danger:"
Shakespeare,"interrupt the monster one word further, and,"
Shakespeare,"by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors"
Shakespeare,and make a stock-fish of thee.
Shakespeare,"Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther"
Shakespeare,off.
Shakespeare,off.
Shakespeare,off.
Shakespeare,Didst thou not say he lied?
Shakespeare,Do I so? take thou that.
Shakespeare,Beats TRINCULO
Shakespeare,"As you like this, give me the lie another time."
Shakespeare,I did not give the lie. Out o' your
Shakespeare,wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
Shakespeare,this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on
Shakespeare,"your monster, and the devil take your fingers!"
Shakespeare,"Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther"
Shakespeare,Beat him enough: after a little time
Shakespeare,I'll beat him too.
Shakespeare,"Stand farther. Come, proceed."
Shakespeare,"Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,"
Shakespeare,"I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,"
Shakespeare,"Having first seized his books, or with a log"
Shakespeare,"Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,"
Shakespeare,Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
Shakespeare,"First to possess his books, for without them"
Shakespeare,"He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not"
Shakespeare,One spirit to command: they all do hate him
Shakespeare,As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
Shakespeare,"He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--"
Shakespeare,"Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal"
Shakespeare,And that most deeply to consider is
Shakespeare,"The beauty of his daughter, he himself"
Shakespeare,"Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,"
Shakespeare,"But only Sycorax my dam and she,"
Shakespeare,But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
Shakespeare,As great'st does least.
Shakespeare,Is it so brave a lass?
Shakespeare,"Ay, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant."
Shakespeare,And bring thee forth brave brood.
Shakespeare,"Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I"
Shakespeare,will be king and queen--save our graces!--and
Shakespeare,Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou
Shakespeare,"like the plot, Trinculo?"
Shakespeare,"Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee, but,"
Shakespeare,"while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head."
Shakespeare,Within this half hour will he be asleep:
Shakespeare,Wilt thou destroy him then?
Shakespeare,"Ay, on mine honour."
Shakespeare,This will I tell my master.
Shakespeare,"Thou makest me merry, I am full of pleasure:"
Shakespeare,Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
Shakespeare,You taught me but while-ere?
Shakespeare,"At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any"
Shakespeare,"reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing."
Shakespeare,Flout 'em and scout 'em
Shakespeare,And scout 'em and flout 'em
Shakespeare,Thought is free.
Shakespeare,That's not the tune.
Shakespeare,Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe
Shakespeare,What is this same?
Shakespeare,"This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture"
Shakespeare,of Nobody.
Shakespeare,"If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:"
Shakespeare,"if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list."
Shakespeare,"O, forgive me my sins!"
Shakespeare,He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!
Shakespeare,Art thou afeard?
Shakespeare,"No, monster, not I."
Shakespeare,"Be not afeard, the isle is full of noises,"
Shakespeare,"Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not."
Shakespeare,Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Shakespeare,"Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices"
Shakespeare,"That, if I then had waked after long sleep,"
Shakespeare,"Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,"
Shakespeare,The clouds methought would open and show riches
Shakespeare,"Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,"
Shakespeare,I cried to dream again.
Shakespeare,"This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall"
Shakespeare,have my music for nothing.
Shakespeare,When Prospero is destroyed.
Shakespeare,That shall be by and by: I remember the story.
Shakespeare,"The sound is going away, let's follow it, and"
Shakespeare,after do our work.
Shakespeare,"Lead, monster, we'll follow. I would I could see"
Shakespeare,"this tabourer, he lays it on."
Shakespeare,"Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano."
Shakespeare,SCENE III. Another part of the island.
Shakespeare,"By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir,"
Shakespeare,My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
Shakespeare,"Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,"
Shakespeare,I needs must rest me.
Shakespeare,"Old lord, I cannot blame thee,"
Shakespeare,"Who am myself attach'd with weariness,"
Shakespeare,"To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest."
Shakespeare,Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
Shakespeare,No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
Shakespeare,"Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks"
Shakespeare,"Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go."
Shakespeare,[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  I am right glad that he's so
Shakespeare,out of hope.
Shakespeare,"Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose"
Shakespeare,That you resolved to effect.
Shakespeare,[Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantage
Shakespeare,Will we take throughly.
Shakespeare,"[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  Let it be to-night,"
Shakespeare,"For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they"
Shakespeare,"Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance"
Shakespeare,As when they are fresh.
Shakespeare,"[Aside to ANTONIO]  I say, to-night: no more."
Shakespeare,Solemn and strange music
Shakespeare,"What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!"
Shakespeare,Marvellous sweet music!
Shakespeare,"Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several  strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet,  they dance about it with gentle actions of  salutation, and, inviting the King,  and c. to eat, they depart"
Shakespeare,"Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?"
Shakespeare,A living drollery. Now I will believe
Shakespeare,"That there are unicorns, that in Arabia"
Shakespeare,"There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix"
Shakespeare,At this hour reigning there.
Shakespeare,"I'll believe both,"
Shakespeare,"And what does else want credit, come to me,"
Shakespeare,And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
Shakespeare,"lie,"
Shakespeare,Though fools at home condemn 'em.
Shakespeare,If in Naples
Shakespeare,"I should report this now, would they believe me?"
Shakespeare,"If I should say, I saw such islanders--"
Shakespeare,"For, certes, these are people of the island--"
Shakespeare,"Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,"
Shakespeare,Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
Shakespeare,Our human generation you shall find
Shakespeare,"Many, nay, almost any."
Shakespeare,"[Aside]              Honest lord,"
Shakespeare,"Thou hast said well, for some of you there present"
Shakespeare,Are worse than devils.
Shakespeare,I cannot too much muse
Shakespeare,"Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,"
Shakespeare,"Although they want the use of tongue, a kind"
Shakespeare,Of excellent dumb discourse.
Shakespeare,[Aside]	Praise in departing.
Shakespeare,They vanish'd strangely.
Shakespeare,"No matter, since"
Shakespeare,"They have left their viands behind, for we have stomachs."
Shakespeare,Will't please you taste of what is here?
Shakespeare,"Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,"
Shakespeare,Who would believe that there were mountaineers
Shakespeare,"Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em"
Shakespeare,Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
Shakespeare,Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
Shakespeare,Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
Shakespeare,Good warrant of.
Shakespeare,"I will stand to and feed,"
Shakespeare,"Although my last: no matter, since I feel"
Shakespeare,"The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,"
Shakespeare,Stand to and do as we.
Shakespeare,"Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a  harpy, claps his wings upon the table, and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes"
Shakespeare,"You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,"
Shakespeare,That hath to instrument this lower world
Shakespeare,"And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea"
Shakespeare,"Hath caused to belch up you, and on this island"
Shakespeare,"Where man doth not inhabit, you 'mongst men"
Shakespeare,"Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad,"
Shakespeare,And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
Shakespeare,Their proper selves.
Shakespeare,"ALONSO, SEBASTIAN  and c. draw their swords"
Shakespeare,You fools! I and my fellows
Shakespeare,"Are ministers of Fate: the elements,"
Shakespeare,"Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well"
Shakespeare,"Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs"
Shakespeare,"Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish"
Shakespeare,One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
Shakespeare,"Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,"
Shakespeare,Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
Shakespeare,And will not be uplifted. But remember--
Shakespeare,For that's my business to you--that you three
Shakespeare,"From Milan did supplant good Prospero,"
Shakespeare,"Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,"
Shakespeare,Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
Shakespeare,"The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have"
Shakespeare,"Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,"
Shakespeare,"Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,"
Shakespeare,"They have bereft, and do pronounce by me:"
Shakespeare,"Lingering perdition, worse than any death"
Shakespeare,"Can be at once, shall step by step attend"
Shakespeare,"You and your ways, whose wraths to guard you from--"
Shakespeare,"Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls"
Shakespeare,Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
Shakespeare,And a clear life ensuing.
Shakespeare,"He vanishes in thunder, then, to soft music  enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table"
Shakespeare,Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
Shakespeare,"Perform'd, my Ariel, a grace it had, devouring:"
Shakespeare,Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
Shakespeare,"In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life"
Shakespeare,"And observation strange, my meaner ministers"
Shakespeare,Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
Shakespeare,And these mine enemies are all knit up
Shakespeare,"In their distractions, they now are in my power,"
Shakespeare,"And in these fits I leave them, while I visit"
Shakespeare,"Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,"
Shakespeare,And his and mine loved darling.
Shakespeare,"I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you"
Shakespeare,In this strange stare?
Shakespeare,"O, it is monstrous, monstrous:"
Shakespeare,"Methought the billows spoke and told me of it,"
Shakespeare,"The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,"
Shakespeare,"That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced"
Shakespeare,The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
Shakespeare,"Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and"
Shakespeare,I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
Shakespeare,And with him there lie mudded.
Shakespeare,"But one fiend at a time,"
Shakespeare,I'll fight their legions o'er.
Shakespeare,I'll be thy second.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO"
Shakespeare,"All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,"
Shakespeare,"Like poison given to work a great time after,"
Shakespeare,Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
Shakespeare,"That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly"
Shakespeare,And hinder them from what this ecstasy
Shakespeare,May now provoke them to.
Shakespeare,"Follow, I pray you."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
Shakespeare,"Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA"
Shakespeare,"If I have too austerely punish'd you,"
Shakespeare,"Your compensation makes amends, for I"
Shakespeare,"Have given you here a third of mine own life,"
Shakespeare,"Or that for which I live, who once again"
Shakespeare,I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations
Shakespeare,Were but my trials of thy love and thou
Shakespeare,"Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,"
Shakespeare,"I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,"
Shakespeare,"Do not smile at me that I boast her off,"
Shakespeare,For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
Shakespeare,And make it halt behind her.
Shakespeare,I do believe it
Shakespeare,Against an oracle.
Shakespeare,"Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition"
Shakespeare,Worthily purchased take my daughter: but
Shakespeare,If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
Shakespeare,All sanctimonious ceremonies may
Shakespeare,"With full and holy rite be minister'd,"
Shakespeare,No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
Shakespeare,"To make this contract grow: but barren hate,"
Shakespeare,Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
Shakespeare,The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
Shakespeare,"That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,"
Shakespeare,As Hymen's lamps shall light you.
Shakespeare,As I hope
Shakespeare,"For quiet days, fair issue and long life,"
Shakespeare,"With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,"
Shakespeare,"The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion."
Shakespeare,"Our worser genius can, shall never melt"
Shakespeare,"Mine honour into lust, to take away"
Shakespeare,The edge of that day's celebration
Shakespeare,"When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,"
Shakespeare,Or Night kept chain'd below.
Shakespeare,Fairly spoke.
Shakespeare,"Sit then and talk with her, she is thine own."
Shakespeare,"What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!"
Shakespeare,What would my potent master? here I am.
Shakespeare,Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
Shakespeare,"Did worthily perform, and I must use you"
Shakespeare,"In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,"
Shakespeare,"O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:"
Shakespeare,"Incite them to quick motion, for I must"
Shakespeare,Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
Shakespeare,"Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,"
Shakespeare,And they expect it from me.
Shakespeare,Presently?
Shakespeare,"Ay, with a twink."
Shakespeare,"Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'"
Shakespeare,"And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'"
Shakespeare,"Each one, tripping on his toe,"
Shakespeare,Will be here with mop and mow.
Shakespeare,"Do you love me, master? no?"
Shakespeare,Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
Shakespeare,Till thou dost hear me call.
Shakespeare,"Well, I conceive."
Shakespeare,"Look thou be true, do not give dalliance"
Shakespeare,Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
Shakespeare,"To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,"
Shakespeare,"Or else, good night your vow!"
Shakespeare,"I warrant you sir,"
Shakespeare,The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
Shakespeare,Abates the ardour of my liver.
Shakespeare,"Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,"
Shakespeare,Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!
Shakespeare,No tongue! all eyes! be silent.
Shakespeare,Soft music
Shakespeare,Enter IRIS
Shakespeare,"Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas"
Shakespeare,"Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease,"
Shakespeare,"Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,"
Shakespeare,"And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep,"
Shakespeare,"Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,"
Shakespeare,"Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,"
Shakespeare,"To make cold nymphs chaste crowns, and thy broom -groves,"
Shakespeare,"Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,"
Shakespeare,"Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard,"
Shakespeare,"And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,"
Shakespeare,"Where thou thyself dost air,--the queen o' the sky,"
Shakespeare,"Whose watery arch and messenger am I,"
Shakespeare,"Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,"
Shakespeare,"Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,"
Shakespeare,To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:
Shakespeare,"Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain."
Shakespeare,Enter CERES
Shakespeare,"Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er"
Shakespeare,"Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter,"
Shakespeare,Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
Shakespeare,"Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,"
Shakespeare,And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
Shakespeare,"My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,"
Shakespeare,"Rich scarf to my proud earth, why hath thy queen"
Shakespeare,"Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?"
Shakespeare,"A contract of true love to celebrate,"
Shakespeare,And some donation freely to estate
Shakespeare,On the blest lovers.
Shakespeare,"Tell me, heavenly bow,"
Shakespeare,"If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,"
Shakespeare,Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
Shakespeare,"The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,"
Shakespeare,Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
Shakespeare,I have forsworn.
Shakespeare,Of her society
Shakespeare,Be not afraid: I met her deity
Shakespeare,Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
Shakespeare,Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
Shakespeare,"Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,"
Shakespeare,"Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid"
Shakespeare,"Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain,"
Shakespeare,"Mars's hot minion is returned again,"
Shakespeare,"Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,"
Shakespeare,Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
Shakespeare,And be a boy right out.
Shakespeare,"High'st queen of state,"
Shakespeare,"Great Juno, comes, I know her by her gait."
Shakespeare,Enter JUNO
Shakespeare,How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
Shakespeare,"To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be"
Shakespeare,And honour'd in their issue.
Shakespeare,They sing:
Shakespeare,"Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,"
Shakespeare,"Long continuance, and increasing,"
Shakespeare,Hourly joys be still upon you!
Shakespeare,Juno sings her blessings upon you.
Shakespeare,"Earth's increase, foison plenty,"
Shakespeare,"Barns and garners never empty,"
Shakespeare,"Vines and clustering bunches growing,"
Shakespeare,"Plants with goodly burthen bowing,"
Shakespeare,Spring come to you at the farthest
Shakespeare,In the very end of harvest!
Shakespeare,"Scarcity and want shall shun you,"
Shakespeare,Ceres' blessing so is on you.
Shakespeare,"This is a most majestic vision, and"
Shakespeare,Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold
Shakespeare,To think these spirits?
Shakespeare,"Spirits, which by mine art"
Shakespeare,I have from their confines call'd to enact
Shakespeare,My present fancies.
Shakespeare,"Let me live here ever,"
Shakespeare,So rare a wonder'd father and a wife
Shakespeare,Makes this place Paradise.
Shakespeare,"Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment"
Shakespeare,"Sweet, now, silence!"
Shakespeare,"Juno and Ceres whisper seriously,"
Shakespeare,"There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,"
Shakespeare,Or else our spell is marr'd.
Shakespeare,"You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,"
Shakespeare,"With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,"
Shakespeare,Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
Shakespeare,"Answer your summons, Juno does command:"
Shakespeare,"Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate"
Shakespeare,"A contract of true love, be not too late."
Shakespeare,Enter certain Nymphs
Shakespeare,"You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,"
Shakespeare,Come hither from the furrow and be merry:
Shakespeare,"Make holiday, your rye-straw hats put on"
Shakespeare,And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
Shakespeare,In country footing.
Shakespeare,"Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they  join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance,  towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts  suddenly, and speaks, after which, to a  strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish"
Shakespeare,[Aside]  I had forgot that foul conspiracy
Shakespeare,Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
Shakespeare,Against my life: the minute of their plot
Shakespeare,Is almost come.
Shakespeare,To the Spirits
Shakespeare,"Well done! avoid, no more!"
Shakespeare,This is strange: your father's in some passion
Shakespeare,That works him strongly.
Shakespeare,Never till this day
Shakespeare,Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.
Shakespeare,"You do look, my son, in a moved sort,"
Shakespeare,"As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir."
Shakespeare,"Our revels now are ended. These our actors,"
Shakespeare,"As I foretold you, were all spirits and"
Shakespeare,"Are melted into air, into thin air:"
Shakespeare,"And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,"
Shakespeare,"The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,"
Shakespeare,"The solemn temples, the great globe itself,"
Shakespeare,"Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve"
Shakespeare,"And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,"
Shakespeare,Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
Shakespeare,"As dreams are made on, and our little life"
Shakespeare,"Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd,"
Shakespeare,"Bear with my weakness, my, brain is troubled:"
Shakespeare,Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
Shakespeare,"If you be pleased, retire into my cell"
Shakespeare,"And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,"
Shakespeare,To still my beating mind.
Shakespeare,We wish your peace.
Shakespeare,"Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come."
Shakespeare,Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?
Shakespeare,"Spirit,"
Shakespeare,We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
Shakespeare,"Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,"
Shakespeare,"I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd"
Shakespeare,Lest I might anger thee.
Shakespeare,"Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?"
Shakespeare,"I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking,"
Shakespeare,So fun of valour that they smote the air
Shakespeare,"For breathing in their faces, beat the ground"
Shakespeare,"For kissing of their feet, yet always bending"
Shakespeare,"Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour,"
Shakespeare,"At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd"
Shakespeare,"their ears,"
Shakespeare,"Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses"
Shakespeare,As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
Shakespeare,That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
Shakespeare,"Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,"
Shakespeare,Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them
Shakespeare,"I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,"
Shakespeare,"There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake"
Shakespeare,O'erstunk their feet.
Shakespeare,"This was well done, my bird."
Shakespeare,Thy shape invisible retain thou still:
Shakespeare,"The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,"
Shakespeare,For stale to catch these thieves.
Shakespeare,"I go, I go."
Shakespeare,"A devil, a born devil, on whose nature"
Shakespeare,"Nurture can never stick, on whom my pains,"
Shakespeare,"Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost,"
Shakespeare,"And as with age his body uglier grows,"
Shakespeare,"So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,"
Shakespeare,Even to roaring.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel,  and c"
Shakespeare,"Come, hang them on this line."
Shakespeare,"PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet"
Shakespeare,"Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not"
Shakespeare,Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.
Shakespeare,"Monster, your fairy, which you say is"
Shakespeare,"a harmless fairy, has done little better than"
Shakespeare,played the Jack with us.
Shakespeare,"Monster, I do smell all horse-piss, at"
Shakespeare,which my nose is in great indignation.
Shakespeare,"So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take"
Shakespeare,"a displeasure against you, look you,--"
Shakespeare,Thou wert but a lost monster.
Shakespeare,"Good my lord, give me thy favour still."
Shakespeare,"Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to"
Shakespeare,Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
Shakespeare,All's hush'd as midnight yet.
Shakespeare,"Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--"
Shakespeare,"There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,"
Shakespeare,"monster, but an infinite loss."
Shakespeare,That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your
Shakespeare,"harmless fairy, monster."
Shakespeare,"I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears"
Shakespeare,for my labour.
Shakespeare,"Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,"
Shakespeare,"This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter."
Shakespeare,Do that good mischief which may make this island
Shakespeare,"Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,"
Shakespeare,For aye thy foot-licker.
Shakespeare,Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.
Shakespeare,O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look
Shakespeare,what a wardrobe here is for thee!
Shakespeare,"Let it alone, thou fool, it is but trash."
Shakespeare,"O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery."
Shakespeare,O king Stephano!
Shakespeare,"Put off that gown, Trinculo, by this hand, I'll have"
Shakespeare,that gown.
Shakespeare,Thy grace shall have it.
Shakespeare,The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean
Shakespeare,To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
Shakespeare,"And do the murder first: if he awake,"
Shakespeare,"From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,"
Shakespeare,Make us strange stuff.
Shakespeare,"Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,"
Shakespeare,is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under
Shakespeare,"the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your"
Shakespeare,hair and prove a bald jerkin.
Shakespeare,"Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace."
Shakespeare,"I thank thee for that jest, here's a garment for't:"
Shakespeare,wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this
Shakespeare,country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent
Shakespeare,"pass of pate, there's another garment for't."
Shakespeare,"Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and"
Shakespeare,away with the rest.
Shakespeare,"I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,"
Shakespeare,"And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes"
Shakespeare,With foreheads villanous low.
Shakespeare,"Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this"
Shakespeare,"away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you"
Shakespeare,"out of my kingdom: go to, carry this."
Shakespeare,And this.
Shakespeare,"Ay, and this."
Shakespeare,"A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits,  in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on"
Shakespeare,"Hey, Mountain, hey!"
Shakespeare,"Silver I there it goes, Silver!"
Shakespeare,"Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!"
Shakespeare,"CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are driven out"
Shakespeare,Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
Shakespeare,"With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews"
Shakespeare,"With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them"
Shakespeare,Than pard or cat o' mountain.
Shakespeare,"Hark, they roar!"
Shakespeare,Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
Shakespeare,Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:
Shakespeare,"Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou"
Shakespeare,Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little
Shakespeare,"Follow, and do me service."
Shakespeare,"Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL"
Shakespeare,Now does my project gather to a head:
Shakespeare,"My charms crack not, my spirits obey, and time"
Shakespeare,Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?
Shakespeare,"On the sixth hour, at which time, my lord,"
Shakespeare,You said our work should cease.
Shakespeare,"I did say so,"
Shakespeare,"When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,"
Shakespeare,How fares the king and's followers?
Shakespeare,Confined together
Shakespeare,"In the same fashion as you gave in charge,"
Shakespeare,"Just as you left them, all prisoners, sir,"
Shakespeare,"In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell,"
Shakespeare,"They cannot budge till your release. The king,"
Shakespeare,"His brother and yours, abide all three distracted"
Shakespeare,"And the remainder mourning over them,"
Shakespeare,"Brimful of sorrow and dismay, but chiefly"
Shakespeare,"Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo,'"
Shakespeare,"His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops"
Shakespeare,From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
Shakespeare,"That if you now beheld them, your affections"
Shakespeare,Would become tender.
Shakespeare,"Dost thou think so, spirit?"
Shakespeare,"Mine would, sir, were I human."
Shakespeare,And mine shall.
Shakespeare,"Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling"
Shakespeare,"Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,"
Shakespeare,"One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,"
Shakespeare,"Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?"
Shakespeare,"Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,"
Shakespeare,Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury
Shakespeare,Do I take part: the rarer action is
Shakespeare,"In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,"
Shakespeare,The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
Shakespeare,"Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:"
Shakespeare,"My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,"
Shakespeare,And they shall be themselves.
Shakespeare,"I'll fetch them, sir."
Shakespeare,"Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,"
Shakespeare,And ye that on the sands with printless foot
Shakespeare,Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
Shakespeare,"When he comes back, you demi-puppets that"
Shakespeare,"By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,"
Shakespeare,"Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime"
Shakespeare,"Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice"
Shakespeare,"To hear the solemn curfew, by whose aid,"
Shakespeare,"Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd"
Shakespeare,"The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,"
Shakespeare,And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
Shakespeare,Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
Shakespeare,Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
Shakespeare,"With his own bolt, the strong-based promontory"
Shakespeare,Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
Shakespeare,The pine and cedar: graves at my command
Shakespeare,"Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth"
Shakespeare,By my so potent art. But this rough magic
Shakespeare,"I here abjure, and, when I have required"
Shakespeare,"Some heavenly music, which even now I do,"
Shakespeare,To work mine end upon their senses that
Shakespeare,"This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,"
Shakespeare,"Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,"
Shakespeare,And deeper than did ever plummet sound
Shakespeare,I'll drown my book.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a  frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO,  SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all  enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,  and there stand charmed, which PROSPERO observing, speaks:"
Shakespeare,A solemn air and the best comforter
Shakespeare,"To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,"
Shakespeare,"Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,"
Shakespeare,For you are spell-stopp'd.
Shakespeare,"Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,"
Shakespeare,"Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,"
Shakespeare,"Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,"
Shakespeare,"And as the morning steals upon the night,"
Shakespeare,"Melting the darkness, so their rising senses"
Shakespeare,Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
Shakespeare,"Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,"
Shakespeare,"My true preserver, and a loyal sir"
Shakespeare,To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces
Shakespeare,Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
Shakespeare,"Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:"
Shakespeare,Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
Shakespeare,"Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,"
Shakespeare,"You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,"
Shakespeare,"Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian,"
Shakespeare,"Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,"
Shakespeare,"Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,"
Shakespeare,Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
Shakespeare,"Begins to swell, and the approaching tide"
Shakespeare,Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
Shakespeare,That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
Shakespeare,"That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,"
Shakespeare,Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
Shakespeare,"I will discase me, and myself present"
Shakespeare,"As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit,"
Shakespeare,Thou shalt ere long be free.
Shakespeare,ARIEL sings and helps to attire him
Shakespeare,Where the bee sucks. there suck I:
Shakespeare,"In a cowslip's bell I lie,"
Shakespeare,There I couch when owls do cry.
Shakespeare,On the bat's back I do fly
Shakespeare,After summer merrily.
Shakespeare,"Merrily, merrily shall I live now"
Shakespeare,Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
Shakespeare,"Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:"
Shakespeare,"But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so."
Shakespeare,"To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:"
Shakespeare,There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
Shakespeare,"Under the hatches, the master and the boatswain"
Shakespeare,"Being awake, enforce them to this place,"
Shakespeare,"And presently, I prithee."
Shakespeare,"I drink the air before me, and return"
Shakespeare,Or ere your pulse twice beat.
Shakespeare,"All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement"
Shakespeare,Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
Shakespeare,Out of this fearful country!
Shakespeare,"Behold, sir king,"
Shakespeare,"The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:"
Shakespeare,For more assurance that a living prince
Shakespeare,"Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body,"
Shakespeare,And to thee and thy company I bid
Shakespeare,A hearty welcome.
Shakespeare,"Whether thou best he or no,"
Shakespeare,"Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,"
Shakespeare,"As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse"
Shakespeare,"Beats as of flesh and blood, and, since I saw thee,"
Shakespeare,"The affliction of my mind amends, with which,"
Shakespeare,"I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,"
Shakespeare,"An if this be at all, a most strange story."
Shakespeare,Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
Shakespeare,Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
Shakespeare,Be living and be here?
Shakespeare,"First, noble friend,"
Shakespeare,"Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot"
Shakespeare,Be measured or confined.
Shakespeare,Whether this be
Shakespeare,"Or be not, I'll not swear."
Shakespeare,You do yet taste
Shakespeare,"Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you"
Shakespeare,"Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!"
Shakespeare,Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
Shakespeare,"But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,"
Shakespeare,I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
Shakespeare,And justify you traitors: at this time
Shakespeare,I will tell no tales.
Shakespeare,[Aside]  The devil speaks in him.
Shakespeare,"For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother"
Shakespeare,"Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive"
Shakespeare,"Thy rankest fault, all of them, and require"
Shakespeare,"My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,"
Shakespeare,Thou must restore.
Shakespeare,"If thou be'st Prospero,"
Shakespeare,"Give us particulars of thy preservation,"
Shakespeare,"How thou hast met us here, who three hours since"
Shakespeare,"Were wreck'd upon this shore, where I have lost--"
Shakespeare,How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
Shakespeare,My dear son Ferdinand.
Shakespeare,"I am woe for't, sir."
Shakespeare,"Irreparable is the loss, and patience"
Shakespeare,Says it is past her cure.
Shakespeare,I rather think
Shakespeare,"You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace"
Shakespeare,For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
Shakespeare,And rest myself content.
Shakespeare,You the like loss!
Shakespeare,"As great to me as late, and, supportable"
Shakespeare,"To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker"
Shakespeare,"Than you may call to comfort you, for I"
Shakespeare,Have lost my daughter.
Shakespeare,A daughter?
Shakespeare,"O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,"
Shakespeare,"The king and queen there! that they were, I wish"
Shakespeare,Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
Shakespeare,Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?
Shakespeare,In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
Shakespeare,At this encounter do so much admire
Shakespeare,That they devour their reason and scarce think
Shakespeare,"Their eyes do offices of truth, their words"
Shakespeare,"Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have"
Shakespeare,"Been justled from your senses, know for certain"
Shakespeare,That I am Prospero and that very duke
Shakespeare,"Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely"
Shakespeare,"Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,"
Shakespeare,"To be the lord on't. No more yet of this,"
Shakespeare,"For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,"
Shakespeare,Not a relation for a breakfast nor
Shakespeare,"Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir,"
Shakespeare,This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
Shakespeare,"And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in."
Shakespeare,"My dukedom since you have given me again,"
Shakespeare,"I will requite you with as good a thing,"
Shakespeare,"At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye"
Shakespeare,As much as me my dukedom.
Shakespeare,Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess
Shakespeare,"Sweet lord, you play me false."
Shakespeare,"No, my dear'st love,"
Shakespeare,I would not for the world.
Shakespeare,"Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,"
Shakespeare,"And I would call it, fair play."
Shakespeare,If this prove
Shakespeare,"A vision of the Island, one dear son"
Shakespeare,Shall I twice lose.
Shakespeare,A most high miracle!
Shakespeare,"Though the seas threaten, they are merciful,"
Shakespeare,I have cursed them without cause.
Shakespeare,Now all the blessings
Shakespeare,Of a glad father compass thee about!
Shakespeare,"Arise, and say how thou camest here."
Shakespeare,"O, wonder!"
Shakespeare,How many goodly creatures are there here!
Shakespeare,"How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,"
Shakespeare,That has such people in't!
Shakespeare,'Tis new to thee.
Shakespeare,What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
Shakespeare,Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
Shakespeare,"Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,"
Shakespeare,And brought us thus together?
Shakespeare,"Sir, she is mortal,"
Shakespeare,But by immortal Providence she's mine:
Shakespeare,I chose her when I could not ask my father
Shakespeare,"For his advice, nor thought I had one. She"
Shakespeare,"Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,"
Shakespeare,"Of whom so often I have heard renown,"
Shakespeare,"But never saw before, of whom I have"
Shakespeare,"Received a second life, and second father"
Shakespeare,This lady makes him to me.
Shakespeare,I am hers:
Shakespeare,"But, O, how oddly will it sound that I"
Shakespeare,Must ask my child forgiveness!
Shakespeare,"There, sir, stop:"
Shakespeare,Let us not burthen our remembrance with
Shakespeare,A heaviness that's gone.
Shakespeare,"I have inly wept,"
Shakespeare,"Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,"
Shakespeare,And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
Shakespeare,For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
Shakespeare,Which brought us hither.
Shakespeare,"I say, Amen, Gonzalo!"
Shakespeare,"Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue"
Shakespeare,"Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice"
Shakespeare,"Beyond a common joy, and set it down"
Shakespeare,With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
Shakespeare,"Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,"
Shakespeare,"And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife"
Shakespeare,"Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom"
Shakespeare,In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
Shakespeare,When no man was his own.
Shakespeare,[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your hands:
Shakespeare,Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
Shakespeare,That doth not wish you joy!
Shakespeare,Be it so! Amen!
Shakespeare,"Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following"
Shakespeare,"O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:"
Shakespeare,"I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,"
Shakespeare,"This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,"
Shakespeare,"That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?"
Shakespeare,Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
Shakespeare,"The best news is, that we have safely found"
Shakespeare,"Our king and company, the next, our ship--"
Shakespeare,"Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--"
Shakespeare,Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
Shakespeare,We first put out to sea.
Shakespeare,"[Aside to PROSPERO]  Sir, all this service"
Shakespeare,Have I done since I went.
Shakespeare,[Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!
Shakespeare,"These are not natural events, they strengthen"
Shakespeare,"From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?"
Shakespeare,"If I did think, sir, I were well awake,"
Shakespeare,"I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,"
Shakespeare,"And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches,"
Shakespeare,Where but even now with strange and several noises
Shakespeare,"Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,"
Shakespeare,"And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,"
Shakespeare,"We were awaked, straightway, at liberty,"
Shakespeare,"Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld"
Shakespeare,"Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master"
Shakespeare,"Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,"
Shakespeare,"Even in a dream, were we divided from them"
Shakespeare,And were brought moping hither.
Shakespeare,[Aside to PROSPERO]          Was't well done?
Shakespeare,"[Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free."
Shakespeare,This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
Shakespeare,And there is in this business more than nature
Shakespeare,Was ever conduct of: some oracle
Shakespeare,Must rectify our knowledge.
Shakespeare,"Sir, my liege,"
Shakespeare,"Sir, my liege,"
Shakespeare,Do not infest your mind with beating on
Shakespeare,"The strangeness of this business, at pick'd leisure"
Shakespeare,"Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,"
Shakespeare,"Which to you shall seem probable, of every"
Shakespeare,"These happen'd accidents, till when, be cheerful"
Shakespeare,And think of each thing well.
Shakespeare,Aside to ARIEL
Shakespeare,Aside to ARIEL
Shakespeare,"Come hither, spirit:"
Shakespeare,"Set Caliban and his companions free,"
Shakespeare,Untie the spell.
Shakespeare,How fares my gracious sir?
Shakespeare,There are yet missing of your company
Shakespeare,Some few odd lads that you remember not.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel"
Shakespeare,"Every man shift for all the rest, and"
Shakespeare,"let no man take care for himself, for all is"
Shakespeare,"but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!"
Shakespeare,"If these be true spies which I wear in my head,"
Shakespeare,here's a goodly sight.
Shakespeare,"O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!"
Shakespeare,How fine my master is! I am afraid
Shakespeare,He will chastise me.
Shakespeare,"What things are these, my lord Antonio?"
Shakespeare,Will money buy 'em?
Shakespeare,"Very like, one of them"
Shakespeare,"Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable."
Shakespeare,"Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,"
Shakespeare,"Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,"
Shakespeare,"His mother was a witch, and one so strong"
Shakespeare,"That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,"
Shakespeare,And deal in her command without her power.
Shakespeare,"These three have robb'd me, and this demi-devil--"
Shakespeare,For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
Shakespeare,To take my life. Two of these fellows you
Shakespeare,"Must know and own, this thing of darkness!"
Shakespeare,Acknowledge mine.
Shakespeare,I shall be pinch'd to death.
Shakespeare,"Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?"
Shakespeare,He is drunk now: where had he wine?
Shakespeare,And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
Shakespeare,Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
Shakespeare,How camest thou in this pickle?
Shakespeare,I have been in such a pickle since I
Shakespeare,"saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of"
Shakespeare,my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.
Shakespeare,"Why, how now, Stephano!"
Shakespeare,"O, touch me not, I am not Stephano, but a cramp."
Shakespeare,"You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?"
Shakespeare,I should have been a sore one then.
Shakespeare,This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.
Shakespeare,Pointing to Caliban
Shakespeare,He is as disproportion'd in his manners
Shakespeare,"As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell,"
Shakespeare,"Take with you your companions, as you look"
Shakespeare,"To have my pardon, trim it handsomely."
Shakespeare,"Ay, that I will, and I'll be wise hereafter"
Shakespeare,And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
Shakespeare,"Was I, to take this drunkard for a god"
Shakespeare,And worship this dull fool!
Shakespeare,"Go to, away!"
Shakespeare,"Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it."
Shakespeare,"Or stole it, rather."
Shakespeare,"Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO"
Shakespeare,"Sir, I invite your highness and your train"
Shakespeare,"To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest"
Shakespeare,"For this one night, which, part of it, I'll waste"
Shakespeare,"With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it"
Shakespeare,"Go quick away, the story of my life"
Shakespeare,And the particular accidents gone by
Shakespeare,Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
Shakespeare,"I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,"
Shakespeare,Where I have hope to see the nuptial
Shakespeare,"Of these our dear-beloved solemnized,"
Shakespeare,"And thence retire me to my Milan, where"
Shakespeare,Every third thought shall be my grave.
Shakespeare,I long
Shakespeare,"To hear the story of your life, which must"
Shakespeare,Take the ear strangely.
Shakespeare,"I'll deliver all,"
Shakespeare,"And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales"
Shakespeare,And sail so expeditious that shall catch
Shakespeare,Your royal fleet far off.
Shakespeare,"My Ariel, chick,"
Shakespeare,That is thy charge: then to the elements
Shakespeare,"Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near."
Shakespeare,SPOKEN BY PROSPERO
Shakespeare,"Now my charms are all o'erthrown,"
Shakespeare,"And what strength I have's mine own,"
Shakespeare,"Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,"
Shakespeare,"I must be here confined by you,"
Shakespeare,"Or sent to Naples. Let me not,"
Shakespeare,Since I have my dukedom got
Shakespeare,"And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell"
Shakespeare,"In this bare island by your spell,"
Shakespeare,But release me from my bands
Shakespeare,With the help of your good hands:
Shakespeare,Gentle breath of yours my sails
Shakespeare,"Must fill, or else my project fails,"
Shakespeare,Which was to please. Now I want
Shakespeare,"Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,"
Shakespeare,"And my ending is despair,"
Shakespeare,"Unless I be relieved by prayer,"
Shakespeare,Which pierces so that it assaults
Shakespeare,Mercy itself and frees all faults.
Shakespeare,"As you from crimes would pardon'd be,"
Shakespeare,Let your indulgence set me free.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Athens. A hall in Timon's house.
Shakespeare,"Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and others, at several doors"
Shakespeare,"Good day, sir."
Shakespeare,I am glad you're well.
Shakespeare,I have not seen you long: how goes the world?
Shakespeare,"It wears, sir, as it grows."
Shakespeare,"Ay, that's well known:"
Shakespeare,"But what particular rarity? what strange,"
Shakespeare,"Which manifold record not matches? See,"
Shakespeare,Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power
Shakespeare,Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.
Shakespeare,"I know them both, th' other's a jeweller."
Shakespeare,"O, 'tis a worthy lord."
Shakespeare,"Nay, that's most fix'd."
Shakespeare,"A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,"
Shakespeare,To an untirable and continuate goodness:
Shakespeare,He passes.
Shakespeare,Jeweller:	I have a jewel here--
Shakespeare,"O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?"
Shakespeare,"Jeweller:	If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--"
Shakespeare,[Reciting to himself]  'When we for recompense have
Shakespeare,"praised the vile,"
Shakespeare,It stains the glory in that happy verse
Shakespeare,Which aptly sings the good.'
Shakespeare,'Tis a good form.
Shakespeare,Looking at the jewel
Shakespeare,"And rich: here is a water, look ye."
Shakespeare,"You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication"
Shakespeare,To the great lord.
Shakespeare,A thing slipp'd idly from me.
Shakespeare,"Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes"
Shakespeare,From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint
Shakespeare,"Shows not till it be struck, our gentle flame"
Shakespeare,Provokes itself and like the current flies
Shakespeare,Each bound it chafes. What have you there?
Shakespeare,"A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?"
Shakespeare,"Upon the heels of my presentment, sir."
Shakespeare,Let's see your piece.
Shakespeare,'Tis a good piece.
Shakespeare,So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.
Shakespeare,Indifferent.
Shakespeare,Admirable: how this grace
Shakespeare,Speaks his own standing! what a mental power
Shakespeare,This eye shoots forth! how big imagination
Shakespeare,Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture
Shakespeare,One might interpret.
Shakespeare,It is a pretty mocking of the life.
Shakespeare,"Here is a touch, is't good?"
Shakespeare,"I will say of it,"
Shakespeare,It tutors nature: artificial strife
Shakespeare,"Lives in these touches, livelier than life."
Shakespeare,"Enter certain Senators, and pass over"
Shakespeare,How this lord is follow'd!
Shakespeare,The senators of Athens: happy man!
Shakespeare,"Look, more!"
Shakespeare,"You see this confluence, this great flood"
Shakespeare,of visitors.
Shakespeare,"I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,"
Shakespeare,Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
Shakespeare,With amplest entertainment: my free drift
Shakespeare,"Halts not particularly, but moves itself"
Shakespeare,In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice
Shakespeare,"Infects one comma in the course I hold,"
Shakespeare,"But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,"
Shakespeare,Leaving no tract behind.
Shakespeare,How shall I understand you?
Shakespeare,I will unbolt to you.
Shakespeare,"You see how all conditions, how all minds,"
Shakespeare,As well of glib and slippery creatures as
Shakespeare,"Of grave and austere quality, tender down"
Shakespeare,Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune
Shakespeare,Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
Shakespeare,Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
Shakespeare,"All sorts of hearts, yea, from the glass-faced flatterer"
Shakespeare,"To Apemantus, that few things loves better"
Shakespeare,Than to abhor himself: even he drops down
Shakespeare,"The knee before him, and returns in peace"
Shakespeare,Most rich in Timon's nod.
Shakespeare,I saw them speak together.
Shakespeare,"Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill"
Shakespeare,Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount
Shakespeare,"Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,"
Shakespeare,That labour on the bosom of this sphere
Shakespeare,"To propagate their states: amongst them all,"
Shakespeare,"Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,"
Shakespeare,"One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,"
Shakespeare,"Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her,"
Shakespeare,Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
Shakespeare,Translates his rivals.
Shakespeare,'Tis conceived to scope.
Shakespeare,"This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,"
Shakespeare,"With one man beckon'd from the rest below,"
Shakespeare,Bowing his head against the sleepy mount
Shakespeare,"To climb his happiness, would be well express'd"
Shakespeare,In our condition.
Shakespeare,"Nay, sir, but hear me on."
Shakespeare,"All those which were his fellows but of late,"
Shakespeare,"Some better than his value, on the moment"
Shakespeare,"Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,"
Shakespeare,"Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,"
Shakespeare,"Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him"
Shakespeare,Drink the free air.
Shakespeare,"Ay, marry, what of these?"
Shakespeare,When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
Shakespeare,"Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants"
Shakespeare,Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
Shakespeare,"Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,"
Shakespeare,Not one accompanying his declining foot.
Shakespeare,'Tis common:
Shakespeare,A thousand moral paintings I can show
Shakespeare,That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
Shakespeare,More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
Shakespeare,To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
Shakespeare,The foot above the head.
Shakespeare,"Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself  courteously to every suitor, a Messenger from  VENTIDIUS talking with him, LUCILIUS and other servants following"
Shakespeare,"Imprison'd is he, say you?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,"
Shakespeare,"His means most short, his creditors most strait:"
Shakespeare,Your honourable letter he desires
Shakespeare,"To those have shut him up, which failing,"
Shakespeare,Periods his comfort.
Shakespeare,"Noble Ventidius! Well,"
Shakespeare,I am not of that feather to shake off
Shakespeare,My friend when he must need me. I do know him
Shakespeare,A gentleman that well deserves a help:
Shakespeare,"Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,"
Shakespeare,and free him.
Shakespeare,Your lordship ever binds him.
Shakespeare,"Commend me to him: I will send his ransom,"
Shakespeare,"And being enfranchised, bid him come to me."
Shakespeare,"'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,"
Shakespeare,But to support him after. Fare you well.
Shakespeare,All happiness to your honour!
Shakespeare,Enter an old Athenian
Shakespeare,"Lord Timon, hear me speak."
Shakespeare,"Freely, good father."
Shakespeare,Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.
Shakespeare,I have so: what of him?
Shakespeare,"Most noble Timon, call the man before thee."
Shakespeare,"Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!"
Shakespeare,"Here, at your lordship's service."
Shakespeare,"This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,"
Shakespeare,By night frequents my house. I am a man
Shakespeare,"That from my first have been inclined to thrift,"
Shakespeare,And my estate deserves an heir more raised
Shakespeare,Than one which holds a trencher.
Shakespeare,"Well, what further?"
Shakespeare,"One only daughter have I, no kin else,"
Shakespeare,On whom I may confer what I have got:
Shakespeare,"The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,"
Shakespeare,And I have bred her at my dearest cost
Shakespeare,In qualities of the best. This man of thine
Shakespeare,"Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,"
Shakespeare,"Join with me to forbid him her resort,"
Shakespeare,Myself have spoke in vain.
Shakespeare,The man is honest.
Shakespeare,"Therefore he will be, Timon:"
Shakespeare,"His honesty rewards him in itself,"
Shakespeare,It must not bear my daughter.
Shakespeare,Does she love him?
Shakespeare,She is young and apt:
Shakespeare,Our own precedent passions do instruct us
Shakespeare,What levity's in youth.
Shakespeare,[To LUCILIUS]           Love you the maid?
Shakespeare,"Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it."
Shakespeare,"If in her marriage my consent be missing,"
Shakespeare,"I call the gods to witness, I will choose"
Shakespeare,"Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,"
Shakespeare,And dispossess her all.
Shakespeare,"How shall she be endow'd,"
Shakespeare,if she be mated with an equal husband?
Shakespeare,"Three talents on the present, in future, all."
Shakespeare,This gentleman of mine hath served me long:
Shakespeare,"To build his fortune I will strain a little,"
Shakespeare,For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:
Shakespeare,"What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,"
Shakespeare,And make him weigh with her.
Shakespeare,"Most noble lord,"
Shakespeare,"Pawn me to this your honour, she is his."
Shakespeare,"My hand to thee, mine honour on my promise."
Shakespeare,Humbly I thank your lordship: never may
Shakespeare,"The state or fortune fall into my keeping,"
Shakespeare,Which is not owed to you!
Shakespeare,Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian
Shakespeare,"Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!"
Shakespeare,"I thank you, you shall hear from me anon:"
Shakespeare,"Go not away. What have you there, my friend?"
Shakespeare,"A piece of painting, which I do beseech"
Shakespeare,Your lordship to accept.
Shakespeare,Painting is welcome.
Shakespeare,"The painting is almost the natural man,"
Shakespeare,"or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,"
Shakespeare,He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are
Shakespeare,"Even such as they give out. I like your work,"
Shakespeare,And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
Shakespeare,Till you hear further from me.
Shakespeare,The gods preserve ye!
Shakespeare,"Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand,"
Shakespeare,"We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel"
Shakespeare,Hath suffer'd under praise.
Shakespeare,"What, my lord! dispraise?"
Shakespeare,A more satiety of commendations.
Shakespeare,"If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,"
Shakespeare,It would unclew me quite.
Shakespeare,"My lord, 'tis rated"
Shakespeare,"As those which sell would give: but you well know,"
Shakespeare,Things of like value differing in the owners
Shakespeare,"Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,"
Shakespeare,You mend the jewel by the wearing it.
Shakespeare,Well mock'd.
Shakespeare,"No, my good lord, he speaks the common tongue,"
Shakespeare,Which all men speak with him.
Shakespeare,"Look, who comes here: will you be chid?"
Shakespeare,Enter APEMANTUS
Shakespeare,Enter APEMANTUS
Shakespeare,"Jeweller: We'll bear, with your lordship."
Shakespeare,He'll spare none.
Shakespeare,"Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!"
Shakespeare,"Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow,"
Shakespeare,"When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest."
Shakespeare,Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.
Shakespeare,Are they not Athenians?
Shakespeare,Then I repent not.
Shakespeare,"Jeweller: You know me, Apemantus?"
Shakespeare,Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.
Shakespeare,"Thou art proud, Apemantus."
Shakespeare,Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
Shakespeare,Whither art going?
Shakespeare,To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
Shakespeare,That's a deed thou'lt die for.
Shakespeare,"Right, if doing nothing be death by the law."
Shakespeare,"How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?"
Shakespeare,"The best, for the innocence."
Shakespeare,Wrought he not well that painted it?
Shakespeare,"He wrought better that made the painter, and yet"
Shakespeare,he's but a filthy piece of work.
Shakespeare,You're a dog.
Shakespeare,"Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?"
Shakespeare,"Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?"
Shakespeare,"No, I eat not lords."
Shakespeare,"An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies."
Shakespeare,"O, they eat lords, so they come by great bellies."
Shakespeare,That's a lascivious apprehension.
Shakespeare,So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.
Shakespeare,"How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?"
Shakespeare,"Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a"
Shakespeare,man a doit.
Shakespeare,What dost thou think 'tis worth?
Shakespeare,"Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!"
Shakespeare,"How now, philosopher!"
Shakespeare,Art not one?
Shakespeare,Then I lie not.
Shakespeare,Art not a poet?
Shakespeare,"Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou"
Shakespeare,hast feigned him a worthy fellow.
Shakespeare,"That's not feigned, he is so."
Shakespeare,"Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy"
Shakespeare,labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'
Shakespeare,"the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!"
Shakespeare,"What wouldst do then, Apemantus?"
Shakespeare,"E'en as Apemantus does now, hate a lord with my heart."
Shakespeare,"What, thyself?"
Shakespeare,Wherefore?
Shakespeare,Wherefore?
Shakespeare,That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
Shakespeare,Art not thou a merchant?
Shakespeare,"Ay, Apemantus."
Shakespeare,"Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!"
Shakespeare,"If traffic do it, the gods do it."
Shakespeare,"Traffic's thy god, and thy god confound thee!"
Shakespeare,Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger
Shakespeare,"'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,"
Shakespeare,All of companionship.
Shakespeare,"Pray, entertain them, give them guide to us."
Shakespeare,You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
Shakespeare,"Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,"
Shakespeare,Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.
Shakespeare,"Enter ALCIBIADES, with the rest"
Shakespeare,"Most welcome, sir!"
Shakespeare,"So, so, there!"
Shakespeare,Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
Shakespeare,That there should be small love 'mongst these
Shakespeare,"sweet knaves,"
Shakespeare,And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
Shakespeare,Into baboon and monkey.
Shakespeare,"Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed"
Shakespeare,Most hungerly on your sight.
Shakespeare,"Right welcome, sir!"
Shakespeare,"Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time"
Shakespeare,"In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in."
Shakespeare,Exeunt all except APEMANTUS
Shakespeare,Enter two Lords
Shakespeare,"What time o' day is't, Apemantus?"
Shakespeare,Time to be honest.
Shakespeare,That time serves still.
Shakespeare,"The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it."
Shakespeare,Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?
Shakespeare,"Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools."
Shakespeare,"Fare thee well, fare thee well."
Shakespeare,Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
Shakespeare,"Why, Apemantus?"
Shakespeare,"Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to"
Shakespeare,give thee none.
Shakespeare,Hang thyself!
Shakespeare,"No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy"
Shakespeare,requests to thy friend.
Shakespeare,"Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!"
Shakespeare,"I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass."
Shakespeare,"He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,"
Shakespeare,And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes
Shakespeare,The very heart of kindness.
Shakespeare,"He pours it out, Plutus, the god of gold,"
Shakespeare,"Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays"
Shakespeare,"Sevenfold above itself, no gift to him,"
Shakespeare,But breeds the giver a return exceeding
Shakespeare,All use of quittance.
Shakespeare,The noblest mind he carries
Shakespeare,That ever govern'd man.
Shakespeare,Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
Shakespeare,I'll keep you company.
Shakespeare,I'll keep you company.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.
Shakespeare,"Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet  served in, FLAVIUS and others attending, then enter  TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators, and VENTIDIUS.  Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS, discontentedly, like himself"
Shakespeare,"Most honour'd Timon,"
Shakespeare,"It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,"
Shakespeare,And call him to long peace.
Shakespeare,"He is gone happy, and has left me rich:"
Shakespeare,"Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound"
Shakespeare,"To your free heart, I do return those talents,"
Shakespeare,"Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help"
Shakespeare,I derived liberty.
Shakespeare,"O, by no means,"
Shakespeare,"Honest Ventidius, you mistake my love:"
Shakespeare,"I gave it freely ever, and there's none"
Shakespeare,"Can truly say he gives, if he receives:"
Shakespeare,"If our betters play at that game, we must not dare"
Shakespeare,"To imitate them, faults that are rich are fair."
Shakespeare,A noble spirit!
Shakespeare,"Nay, my lords,"
Shakespeare,They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON
Shakespeare,Ceremony was but devised at first
Shakespeare,"To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,"
Shakespeare,"Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown,"
Shakespeare,"But where there is true friendship, there needs none."
Shakespeare,"Pray, sit, more welcome are ye to my fortunes"
Shakespeare,Than my fortunes to me.
Shakespeare,They sit
Shakespeare,They sit
Shakespeare,"My lord, we always have confess'd it."
Shakespeare,"Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?"
Shakespeare,"O, Apemantus, you are welcome."
Shakespeare,You shall not make me welcome:
Shakespeare,I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
Shakespeare,"Fie, thou'rt a churl, ye've got a humour there"
Shakespeare,Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.
Shakespeare,"They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est,' but yond"
Shakespeare,"man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by"
Shakespeare,"himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is"
Shakespeare,"he fit for't, indeed."
Shakespeare,"Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to"
Shakespeare,"observe, I give thee warning on't."
Shakespeare,"I take no heed of thee, thou'rt an Athenian,"
Shakespeare,"therefore welcome: I myself would have no power,"
Shakespeare,"prithee, let my meat make thee silent."
Shakespeare,"I scorn thy meat, 'twould choke me, for I should"
Shakespeare,"ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of"
Shakespeare,"men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me"
Shakespeare,"to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood,"
Shakespeare,"and all the madness is, he cheers them up too."
Shakespeare,I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
Shakespeare,"Methinks they should invite them without knives,"
Shakespeare,"Good for their meat, and safer for their lives."
Shakespeare,"There's much example for't, the fellow that sits"
Shakespeare,"next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the"
Shakespeare,"breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest"
Shakespeare,man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a
Shakespeare,"huge man, I should fear to drink at meals,"
Shakespeare,Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:
Shakespeare,Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
Shakespeare,"My lord, in heart, and let the health go round."
Shakespeare,"Let it flow this way, my good lord."
Shakespeare,Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides
Shakespeare,well. Those healths will make thee and thy state
Shakespeare,"look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to"
Shakespeare,"be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:"
Shakespeare,"This and my food are equals, there's no odds:"
Shakespeare,Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
Shakespeare,Apemantus' grace.
Shakespeare,"Immortal gods, I crave no pelf,"
Shakespeare,I pray for no man but myself:
Shakespeare,"Grant I may never prove so fond,"
Shakespeare,"To trust man on his oath or bond,"
Shakespeare,"Or a harlot, for her weeping,"
Shakespeare,"Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:"
Shakespeare,"Or a keeper with my freedom,"
Shakespeare,"Or my friends, if I should need 'em."
Shakespeare,Amen. So fall to't:
Shakespeare,"Rich men sin, and I eat root."
Shakespeare,Eats and drinks
Shakespeare,"Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!"
Shakespeare,"Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now."
Shakespeare,"My heart is ever at your service, my lord."
Shakespeare,You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a
Shakespeare,dinner of friends.
Shakespeare,"So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meat"
Shakespeare,like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.
Shakespeare,"Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,"
Shakespeare,that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!
Shakespeare,"Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you"
Shakespeare,"would once use our hearts, whereby we might express"
Shakespeare,"some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves"
Shakespeare,for ever perfect.
Shakespeare,"O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods"
Shakespeare,themselves have provided that I shall have much help
Shakespeare,from you: how had you been my friends else? why
Shakespeare,"have you that charitable title from thousands, did"
Shakespeare,not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
Shakespeare,more of you to myself than you can with modesty
Shakespeare,"speak in your own behalf, and thus far I confirm"
Shakespeare,"you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any"
Shakespeare,"friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they"
Shakespeare,"were the most needless creatures living, should we"
Shakespeare,"ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble"
Shakespeare,sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
Shakespeare,"sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished"
Shakespeare,"myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We"
Shakespeare,are born to do benefits: and what better or
Shakespeare,properer can we can our own than the riches of our
Shakespeare,"friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have"
Shakespeare,"so many, like brothers, commanding one another's"
Shakespeare,"fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!"
Shakespeare,"Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to"
Shakespeare,"forget their faults, I drink to you."
Shakespeare,"Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon."
Shakespeare,Joy had the like conception in our eyes
Shakespeare,And at that instant like a babe sprung up.
Shakespeare,"Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard."
Shakespeare,"I promise you, my lord, you moved me much."
Shakespeare,Much!
Shakespeare,"Tucket, within"
Shakespeare,What means that trump?
Shakespeare,How now?
Shakespeare,"Please you, my lord, there are certain"
Shakespeare,ladies most desirous of admittance.
Shakespeare,Ladies! what are their wills?
Shakespeare,"There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which"
Shakespeare,"bears that office, to signify their pleasures."
Shakespeare,"I pray, let them be admitted."
Shakespeare,Enter Cupid
Shakespeare,"Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all"
Shakespeare,That of his bounties taste! The five best senses
Shakespeare,"Acknowledge thee their patron, and come freely"
Shakespeare,"To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,"
Shakespeare,"Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise,"
Shakespeare,They only now come but to feast thine eyes.
Shakespeare,"They're welcome all, let 'em have kind admittance:"
Shakespeare,"Music, make their welcome!"
Shakespeare,Exit Cupid
Shakespeare,"You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved."
Shakespeare,"Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies  as Amazons, with lutes in their hands, dancing and playing"
Shakespeare,"Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!"
Shakespeare,They dance! they are mad women.
Shakespeare,Like madness is the glory of this life.
Shakespeare,As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.
Shakespeare,"We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves,"
Shakespeare,"And spend our flatteries, to drink those men"
Shakespeare,"Upon whose age we void it up again,"
Shakespeare,With poisonous spite and envy.
Shakespeare,Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
Shakespeare,"Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves"
Shakespeare,Of their friends' gift?
Shakespeare,I should fear those that dance before me now
Shakespeare,"Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done,"
Shakespeare,Men shut their doors against a setting sun.
Shakespeare,"The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of  TIMON, and to show their loves, each singles out an  Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty strain or two to the hautboys, and cease"
Shakespeare,"You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,"
Shakespeare,"Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,"
Shakespeare,"Which was not half so beautiful and kind,"
Shakespeare,"You have added worth unto 't and lustre,"
Shakespeare,"And entertain'd me with mine own device,"
Shakespeare,I am to thank you for 't.
Shakespeare,"My lord, you take us even at the best."
Shakespeare,"'Faith, for the worst is filthy, and would not hold"
Shakespeare,"taking, I doubt me."
Shakespeare,"Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:"
Shakespeare,Please you to dispose yourselves.
Shakespeare,"Most thankfully, my lord."
Shakespeare,"Most thankfully, my lord."
Shakespeare,Exeunt Cupid and Ladies
Shakespeare,Flavius.
Shakespeare,The little casket bring me hither.
Shakespeare,"Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!"
Shakespeare,"There is no crossing him in 's humour,"
Shakespeare,"Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,"
Shakespeare,"When all's spent, he 'ld be cross'd then, an he could."
Shakespeare,"'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,"
Shakespeare,That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.
Shakespeare,Where be our men?
Shakespeare,"Here, my lord, in readiness."
Shakespeare,Our horses!
Shakespeare,"Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casket"
Shakespeare,"O my friends,"
Shakespeare,"I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,"
Shakespeare,"I must entreat you, honour me so much"
Shakespeare,"As to advance this jewel, accept it and wear it,"
Shakespeare,Kind my lord.
Shakespeare,"I am so far already in your gifts,--"
Shakespeare,So are we all.
Shakespeare,"My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate"
Shakespeare,"Newly alighted, and come to visit you."
Shakespeare,They are fairly welcome.
Shakespeare,"I beseech your honour,"
Shakespeare,"Vouchsafe me a word, it does concern you near."
Shakespeare,"Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee:"
Shakespeare,"I prithee, let's be provided to show them"
Shakespeare,[Aside]  I scarce know how.
Shakespeare,Enter a Second Servant
Shakespeare,"May it please your honour, Lord Lucius,"
Shakespeare,"Out of his free love, hath presented to you"
Shakespeare,"Four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver."
Shakespeare,"I shall accept them fairly, let the presents"
Shakespeare,Be worthily entertain'd.
Shakespeare,Enter a third Servant
Shakespeare,"Please you, my lord, that honourable"
Shakespeare,"gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company"
Shakespeare,"to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour"
Shakespeare,two brace of greyhounds.
Shakespeare,"I'll hunt with him, and let them be received,"
Shakespeare,Not without fair reward.
Shakespeare,[Aside]                What will this come to?
Shakespeare,"He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,"
Shakespeare,And all out of an empty coffer:
Shakespeare,"Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,"
Shakespeare,"To show him what a beggar his heart is,"
Shakespeare,Being of no power to make his wishes good:
Shakespeare,His promises fly so beyond his state
Shakespeare,"That what he speaks is all in debt, he owes"
Shakespeare,For every word: he is so kind that he now
Shakespeare,"Pays interest for 't, his land's put to their books."
Shakespeare,"Well, would I were gently put out of office"
Shakespeare,Before I were forced out!
Shakespeare,Happier is he that has no friend to feed
Shakespeare,Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.
Shakespeare,I bleed inwardly for my lord.
Shakespeare,You do yourselves
Shakespeare,"Much wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:"
Shakespeare,"Here, my lord, a trifle of our love."
Shakespeare,With more than common thanks I will receive it.
Shakespeare,"O, he's the very soul of bounty!"
Shakespeare,"And now I remember, my lord, you gave"
Shakespeare,Good words the other day of a bay courser
Shakespeare,"I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it."
Shakespeare,"O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that."
Shakespeare,"You may take my word, my lord, I know, no man"
Shakespeare,Can justly praise but what he does affect:
Shakespeare,"I weigh my friend's affection with mine own,"
Shakespeare,I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.
Shakespeare,"O, none so welcome."
Shakespeare,I take all and your several visitations
Shakespeare,"So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give,"
Shakespeare,"Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,"
Shakespeare,"And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,"
Shakespeare,"Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich,"
Shakespeare,It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living
Shakespeare,"Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast"
Shakespeare,Lie in a pitch'd field.
Shakespeare,"Ay, defiled land, my lord."
Shakespeare,We are so virtuously bound--
Shakespeare,And so
Shakespeare,Am I to you.
Shakespeare,So infinitely endear'd--
Shakespeare,"All to you. Lights, more lights!"
Shakespeare,"The best of happiness,"
Shakespeare,"Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!"
Shakespeare,Ready for his friends.
Shakespeare,Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON
Shakespeare,What a coil's here!
Shakespeare,Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
Shakespeare,I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
Shakespeare,That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:
Shakespeare,"Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,"
Shakespeare,Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.
Shakespeare,"Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be"
Shakespeare,good to thee.
Shakespeare,"No, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,"
Shakespeare,"there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then"
Shakespeare,"thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,"
Shakespeare,"Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in"
Shakespeare,"paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and"
Shakespeare,vain-glories?
Shakespeare,"Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am"
Shakespeare,"sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell, and come"
Shakespeare,with better music.
Shakespeare,So:
Shakespeare,"Thou wilt not hear me now, thou shalt not then:"
Shakespeare,I'll lock thy heaven from thee.
Shakespeare,"O, that men's ears should be"
Shakespeare,"To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!"
Shakespeare,SCENE I. A Senator's house.
Shakespeare,"Enter Senator, with papers in his hand"
Shakespeare,"And late, five thousand: to Varro and to Isidore"
Shakespeare,"He owes nine thousand, besides my former sum,"
Shakespeare,Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion
Shakespeare,"Of raging waste? It cannot hold, it will not."
Shakespeare,"If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,"
Shakespeare,"And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold."
Shakespeare,"If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty more"
Shakespeare,"Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,"
Shakespeare,"Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight,"
Shakespeare,"And able horses. No porter at his gate,"
Shakespeare,But rather one that smiles and still invites
Shakespeare,All that pass by. It cannot hold: no reason
Shakespeare,"Can found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!"
Shakespeare,"Caphis, I say!"
Shakespeare,Enter CAPHIS
Shakespeare,"Here, sir, what is your pleasure?"
Shakespeare,"Get on your cloak, and haste you to Lord Timon,"
Shakespeare,"Importune him for my moneys, be not ceased"
Shakespeare,"With slight denial, nor then silenced when--"
Shakespeare,'Commend me to your master'--and the cap
Shakespeare,"Plays in the right hand, thus: but tell him,"
Shakespeare,"My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn"
Shakespeare,"Out of mine own, his days and times are past"
Shakespeare,And my reliances on his fracted dates
Shakespeare,"Have smit my credit: I love and honour him,"
Shakespeare,"But must not break my back to heal his finger,"
Shakespeare,"Immediate are my needs, and my relief"
Shakespeare,"Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,"
Shakespeare,But find supply immediate. Get you gone:
Shakespeare,"Put on a most importunate aspect,"
Shakespeare,"A visage of demand, for, I do fear,"
Shakespeare,"When every feather sticks in his own wing,"
Shakespeare,"Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,"
Shakespeare,Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.
Shakespeare,"I go, sir."
Shakespeare,"'I go, sir!'--Take the bonds along with you,"
Shakespeare,And have the dates in contempt.
Shakespeare,Go.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. The same. A hall in Timon's house.
Shakespeare,"Enter FLAVIUS, with many bills in his hand"
Shakespeare,"No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,"
Shakespeare,"That he will neither know how to maintain it,"
Shakespeare,Nor cease his flow of riot: takes no account
Shakespeare,"How things go from him, nor resumes no care"
Shakespeare,Of what is to continue: never mind
Shakespeare,"Was to be so unwise, to be so kind."
Shakespeare,"What shall be done? he will not hear, till feel:"
Shakespeare,"I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting."
Shakespeare,"Fie, fie, fie, fie!"
Shakespeare,"Enter CAPHIS, and the Servants of Isidore and Varro"
Shakespeare,"Good even, Varro: what,"
Shakespeare,You come for money?
Shakespeare,Varro's Servant	Is't not your business too?
Shakespeare,"It is: and yours too, Isidore?"
Shakespeare,Isidore's Servant	It is so.
Shakespeare,Would we were all discharged!
Shakespeare,Varro's Servant	I fear it.
Shakespeare,Here comes the lord.
Shakespeare,"Enter TIMON, ALCIBIADES, and Lords,  and c"
Shakespeare,"So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again,"
Shakespeare,My Alcibiades. With me? what is your will?
Shakespeare,"My lord, here is a note of certain dues."
Shakespeare,Dues! Whence are you?
Shakespeare,"Of Athens here, my lord."
Shakespeare,Go to my steward.
Shakespeare,"Please it your lordship, he hath put me off"
Shakespeare,To the succession of new days this month:
Shakespeare,My master is awaked by great occasion
Shakespeare,"To call upon his own, and humbly prays you"
Shakespeare,That with your other noble parts you'll suit
Shakespeare,In giving him his right.
Shakespeare,"Mine honest friend,"
Shakespeare,"I prithee, but repair to me next morning."
Shakespeare,"Contain thyself, good friend."
Shakespeare,"Varro's Servant	One Varro's servant, my good lord,--"
Shakespeare,"Isidore's Servant	From Isidore,"
Shakespeare,He humbly prays your speedy payment.
Shakespeare,"If you did know, my lord, my master's wants--"
Shakespeare,"Varro's Servant	'Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks And past."
Shakespeare,"Isidore's Servant	         Your steward puts me off, my lord,"
Shakespeare,And I am sent expressly to your lordship.
Shakespeare,Give me breath.
Shakespeare,"I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on,"
Shakespeare,I'll wait upon you instantly.
Shakespeare,Exeunt ALCIBIADES and Lords
Shakespeare,To FLAVIUS
Shakespeare,To FLAVIUS
Shakespeare,To FLAVIUS
Shakespeare,"Come hither: pray you,"
Shakespeare,"How goes the world, that I am thus encounter'd"
Shakespeare,"With clamourous demands of date-broke bonds,"
Shakespeare,"And the detention of long-since-due debts,"
Shakespeare,Against my honour?
Shakespeare,"Please you, gentlemen,"
Shakespeare,The time is unagreeable to this business:
Shakespeare,"Your importunacy cease till after dinner,"
Shakespeare,That I may make his lordship understand
Shakespeare,Wherefore you are not paid.
Shakespeare,"Do so, my friends. See them well entertain'd."
Shakespeare,Enter APEMANTUS and Fool
Shakespeare,"Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus:"
Shakespeare,let's ha' some sport with 'em.
Shakespeare,"Varro's Servant	Hang him, he'll abuse us."
Shakespeare,"Isidore's Servant	A plague upon him, dog!"
Shakespeare,"Varro's Servant	How dost, fool?"
Shakespeare,Dost dialogue with thy shadow?
Shakespeare,Varro's Servant	I speak not to thee.
Shakespeare,"No,'tis to thyself."
Shakespeare,Come away.
Shakespeare,Isidore's Servant	There's the fool hangs on your back already.
Shakespeare,"No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet."
Shakespeare,Where's the fool now?
Shakespeare,"He last asked the question. Poor rogues, and"
Shakespeare,usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!
Shakespeare,"What are we, Apemantus?"
Shakespeare,Asses.
Shakespeare,"That you ask me what you are, and do not know"
Shakespeare,"yourselves. Speak to 'em, fool."
Shakespeare,"How do you, gentlemen?"
Shakespeare,"Gramercies, good fool: how does your mistress?"
Shakespeare,She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens
Shakespeare,as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!
Shakespeare,Good! gramercy.
Shakespeare,"Look you, here comes my mistress' page."
Shakespeare,"[To the Fool]  Why, how now, captain! what do you"
Shakespeare,"in this wise company? How dost thou, Apemantus?"
Shakespeare,"Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer"
Shakespeare,thee profitably.
Shakespeare,"Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of"
Shakespeare,these letters: I know not which is which.
Shakespeare,Canst not read?
Shakespeare,"There will little learning die then, that day thou"
Shakespeare,"art hanged. This is to Lord Timon, this to"
Shakespeare,"Alcibiades. Go, thou wast born a bastard, and thou't"
Shakespeare,die a bawd.
Shakespeare,"Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish a"
Shakespeare,"dog's death. Answer not, I am gone."
Shakespeare,"E'en so thou outrunnest grace. Fool, I will go with"
Shakespeare,you to Lord Timon's.
Shakespeare,Will you leave me there?
Shakespeare,If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?
Shakespeare,"Ay, would they served us!"
Shakespeare,"So would I,--as good a trick as ever hangman served thief."
Shakespeare,Are you three usurers' men?
Shakespeare,"Ay, fool."
Shakespeare,I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my
Shakespeare,"mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come"
Shakespeare,"to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and"
Shakespeare,"go away merry, but they enter my mistress' house"
Shakespeare,"merrily, and go away sadly: the reason of this?"
Shakespeare,Varro's Servant	I could render one.
Shakespeare,"Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster"
Shakespeare,"and a knave, which not-withstanding, thou shalt be"
Shakespeare,no less esteemed.
Shakespeare,"Varro's Servant	What is a whoremaster, fool?"
Shakespeare,"A fool in good clothes, and something like thee."
Shakespeare,"'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord,"
Shakespeare,"sometime like a lawyer, sometime like a philosopher,"
Shakespeare,with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is
Shakespeare,"very often like a knight, and, generally, in all"
Shakespeare,shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore
Shakespeare,"to thirteen, this spirit walks in."
Shakespeare,Varro's Servant	Thou art not altogether a fool.
Shakespeare,Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as
Shakespeare,"I have, so much wit thou lackest."
Shakespeare,That answer might have become Apemantus.
Shakespeare,"Aside, aside, here comes Lord Timon."
Shakespeare,Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS
Shakespeare,Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS
Shakespeare,"Come with me, fool, come."
Shakespeare,"I do not always follow lover, elder brother and"
Shakespeare,"woman, sometime the philosopher."
Shakespeare,Exeunt APEMANTUS and Fool
Shakespeare,"Pray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon."
Shakespeare,You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time
Shakespeare,"Had you not fully laid my state before me,"
Shakespeare,"That I might so have rated my expense,"
Shakespeare,As I had leave of means?
Shakespeare,"You would not hear me,"
Shakespeare,At many leisures I proposed.
Shakespeare,Go to:
Shakespeare,Perchance some single vantages you took.
Shakespeare,When my indispos ition put you back:
Shakespeare,"And that unaptness made your minister,"
Shakespeare,Thus to excuse yourself.
Shakespeare,"At many times I brought in my accounts,"
Shakespeare,"Laid them before you, you would throw them off,"
Shakespeare,"And say, you found them in mine honesty."
Shakespeare,"When, for some trifling present, you have bid me"
Shakespeare,"Return so much, I have shook my head and wept,"
Shakespeare,"Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you"
Shakespeare,To hold your hand more close: I did endure
Shakespeare,"Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have"
Shakespeare,Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
Shakespeare,"And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,"
Shakespeare,"Though you hear now, too late--yet now's a time--"
Shakespeare,The greatest of your having lacks a half
Shakespeare,To pay your present debts.
Shakespeare,Let all my land be sold.
Shakespeare,"'Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone,"
Shakespeare,And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
Shakespeare,Of present dues: the future comes apace:
Shakespeare,What shall defend the interim? and at length
Shakespeare,How goes our reckoning?
Shakespeare,To Lacedaemon did my land extend.
Shakespeare,"O my good lord, the world is but a word:"
Shakespeare,"Were it all yours to give it in a breath,"
Shakespeare,How quickly were it gone!
Shakespeare,You tell me true.
Shakespeare,"If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,"
Shakespeare,Call me before the exactest auditors
Shakespeare,"And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,"
Shakespeare,When all our offices have been oppress'd
Shakespeare,"With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept"
Shakespeare,"With drunken spilth of wine, when every room"
Shakespeare,"Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,"
Shakespeare,"I have retired me to a wasteful cock,"
Shakespeare,And set mine eyes at flow.
Shakespeare,"Prithee, no more."
Shakespeare,"Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!"
Shakespeare,How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
Shakespeare,This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?
Shakespeare,"What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is"
Shakespeare,Lord Timon's?
Shakespeare,"Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!"
Shakespeare,"Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,"
Shakespeare,The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:
Shakespeare,"Feast-won, fast-lost, one cloud of winter showers,"
Shakespeare,These flies are couch'd.
Shakespeare,"Come, sermon me no further:"
Shakespeare,"No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart,"
Shakespeare,"Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given."
Shakespeare,"Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,"
Shakespeare,"To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart,"
Shakespeare,"If I would broach the vessels of my love,"
Shakespeare,"And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,"
Shakespeare,Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
Shakespeare,As I can bid thee speak.
Shakespeare,Assurance bless your thoughts!
Shakespeare,"And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd,"
Shakespeare,"That I account them blessings, for by these"
Shakespeare,Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you
Shakespeare,"Mistake my fortunes, I am wealthy in my friends."
Shakespeare,Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!
Shakespeare,"Enter FLAMINIUS, SERVILIUS, and other Servants"
Shakespeare,My lord? my lord?
Shakespeare,"I will dispatch you severally, you to Lord Lucius,"
Shakespeare,to Lord Lucullus you: I hunted with his honour
Shakespeare,"to-day: you, to Sempronius: commend me to their"
Shakespeare,"loves, and, I am proud, say, that my occasions have"
Shakespeare,found time to use 'em toward a supply of money: let
Shakespeare,the request be fifty talents.
Shakespeare,"As you have said, my lord."
Shakespeare,[Aside]  Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!
Shakespeare,"Go you, sir, to the senators--"
Shakespeare,"Of whom, even to the state's best health, I have"
Shakespeare,Deserved this hearing--bid 'em send o' the instant
Shakespeare,A thousand talents to me.
Shakespeare,I have been bold--
Shakespeare,For that I knew it the most general way--
Shakespeare,"To them to use your signet and your name,"
Shakespeare,"But they do shake their heads, and I am here"
Shakespeare,No richer in return.
Shakespeare,Is't true? can't be?
Shakespeare,"They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,"
Shakespeare,"That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot"
Shakespeare,"Do what they would, are sorry--you are honourable,--"
Shakespeare,But yet they could have wish'd--they know not--
Shakespeare,Something hath been amiss--a noble nature
Shakespeare,"May catch a wrench--would all were well--'tis pity,--"
Shakespeare,"And so, intending other serious matters,"
Shakespeare,"After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,"
Shakespeare,With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
Shakespeare,They froze me into silence.
Shakespeare,"You gods, reward them!"
Shakespeare,"Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows"
Shakespeare,Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:
Shakespeare,"Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows,"
Shakespeare,"'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind,"
Shakespeare,"And nature, as it grows again toward earth,"
Shakespeare,"Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy."
Shakespeare,To a Servant
Shakespeare,Go to Ventidius.
Shakespeare,"Prithee, be not sad,"
Shakespeare,"Thou art true and honest, ingeniously I speak."
Shakespeare,No blame belongs to thee.
Shakespeare,To Servant
Shakespeare,To Servant
Shakespeare,Ventidius lately
Shakespeare,"Buried his father, by whose death he's stepp'd"
Shakespeare,"Into a great estate: when he was poor,"
Shakespeare,"Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,"
Shakespeare,"I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me,"
Shakespeare,Bid him suppose some good necessity
Shakespeare,"Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd"
Shakespeare,With those five talents.
Shakespeare,"That had, give't these fellows"
Shakespeare,"To whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak, or think,"
Shakespeare,That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.
Shakespeare,I would I could not think it: that thought is
Shakespeare,"bounty's foe,"
Shakespeare,"Being free itself, it thinks all others so."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. A room in Lucullus' house.
Shakespeare,FLAMINIUS waiting. Enter a Servant to him
Shakespeare,"I have told my lord of you, he is coming down to you."
Shakespeare,Enter LUCULLUS
Shakespeare,Here's my lord.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  One of Lord Timon's men? a gift, I"
Shakespeare,"warrant. Why, this hits right, I dreamt of a silver"
Shakespeare,"basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius, honest"
Shakespeare,"Flaminius, you are very respectively welcome, sir."
Shakespeare,Fill me some wine.
Shakespeare,Exit Servants
Shakespeare,"And how does that honourable, complete, free-hearted"
Shakespeare,"gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord"
Shakespeare,and master?
Shakespeare,His health is well sir.
Shakespeare,"I am right glad that his health is well, sir: and"
Shakespeare,"what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?"
Shakespeare,"'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which, in my"
Shakespeare,"lord's behalf, I come to entreat your honour to"
Shakespeare,"supply, who, having great and instant occasion to"
Shakespeare,"use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to"
Shakespeare,"furnish him, nothing doubting your present"
Shakespeare,assistance therein.
Shakespeare,"La, la, la, la! 'nothing doubting,' says he? Alas,"
Shakespeare,"good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not"
Shakespeare,keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha'
Shakespeare,"dined with him, and told him on't, and come again to"
Shakespeare,"supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less,"
Shakespeare,"and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning"
Shakespeare,"by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty"
Shakespeare,"is his: I ha' told him on't, but I could ne'er get"
Shakespeare,him from't.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter Servant, with wine"
Shakespeare,"Please your lordship, here is the wine."
Shakespeare,"Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee."
Shakespeare,Your lordship speaks your pleasure.
Shakespeare,I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt
Shakespeare,spirit--give thee thy due--and one that knows what
Shakespeare,"belongs to reason, and canst use the time well, if"
Shakespeare,the time use thee well: good parts in thee.
Shakespeare,"Get you gone, sirrah."
Shakespeare,"Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a"
Shakespeare,"bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise, and thou"
Shakespeare,"knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,"
Shakespeare,"that this is no time to lend money, especially upon"
Shakespeare,"bare friendship, without security. Here's three"
Shakespeare,"solidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say"
Shakespeare,thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.
Shakespeare,"Is't possible the world should so much differ,"
Shakespeare,"And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,"
Shakespeare,To him that worships thee!
Shakespeare,Throwing the money back
Shakespeare,"Ha! now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master."
Shakespeare,May these add to the number that may scald thee!
Shakespeare,"Let moulten coin be thy damnation,"
Shakespeare,"Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!"
Shakespeare,"Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,"
Shakespeare,"It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,"
Shakespeare,"I feel master's passion! this slave,"
Shakespeare,"Unto his honour, has my lord's meat in him:"
Shakespeare,"Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,"
Shakespeare,When he is turn'd to poison?
Shakespeare,"O, may diseases only work upon't!"
Shakespeare,"And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature"
Shakespeare,"Which my lord paid for, be of any power"
Shakespeare,"To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!"
Shakespeare,"Enter LUCILIUS, with three Strangers"
Shakespeare,"Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and"
Shakespeare,an honourable gentleman.
Shakespeare,"We know him for no less, though we are but strangers"
Shakespeare,"to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and"
Shakespeare,which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's
Shakespeare,"happy hours are done and past, and his estate"
Shakespeare,shrinks from him.
Shakespeare,"Fie, no, do not believe it, he cannot want for money."
Shakespeare,"But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,"
Shakespeare,one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow
Shakespeare,"so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and"
Shakespeare,"showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied."
Shakespeare,"I tell you, denied, my lord."
Shakespeare,"What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,"
Shakespeare,I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!
Shakespeare,there was very little honour showed in't. For my own
Shakespeare,"part, I must needs confess, I have received some"
Shakespeare,"small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels"
Shakespeare,"and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his,"
Shakespeare,"yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should"
Shakespeare,ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.
Shakespeare,Enter SERVILIUS
Shakespeare,Enter SERVILIUS
Shakespeare,"See, by good hap, yonder's my lord,"
Shakespeare,"I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,--"
Shakespeare,To LUCIUS
Shakespeare,To LUCIUS
Shakespeare,"Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:"
Shakespeare,"commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very"
Shakespeare,exquisite friend.
Shakespeare,"May it please your honour, my lord hath sent--"
Shakespeare,Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to
Shakespeare,"that lord, he's ever sending: how shall I thank"
Shakespeare,"him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?"
Shakespeare,"Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord,"
Shakespeare,requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
Shakespeare,with so many talents.
Shakespeare,"I know his lordship is but merry with me,"
Shakespeare,He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.
Shakespeare,"But in the mean time he wants less, my lord."
Shakespeare,"If his occasion were not virtuous,"
Shakespeare,I should not urge it half so faithfully.
Shakespeare,"Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?"
Shakespeare,"Upon my soul,'tis true, sir."
Shakespeare,What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself
Shakespeare,"against such a good time, when I might ha' shown"
Shakespeare,"myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I"
Shakespeare,"should purchase the day before for a little part,"
Shakespeare,"and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,"
Shakespeare,"before the gods, I am not able to do,--the more"
Shakespeare,"beast, I say:--I was sending to use Lord Timon"
Shakespeare,"myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would"
Shakespeare,"not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now."
Shakespeare,"Commend me bountifully to his good lordship, and I"
Shakespeare,"hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,"
Shakespeare,because I have no power to be kind: and tell him
Shakespeare,"this from me, I count it one of my greatest"
Shakespeare,"afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an"
Shakespeare,"honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you"
Shakespeare,"befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?"
Shakespeare,"Yes, sir, I shall."
Shakespeare,"I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius."
Shakespeare,Exit SERVILIUS
Shakespeare,"True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed,"
Shakespeare,And he that's once denied will hardly speed.
Shakespeare,"Do you observe this, Hostilius?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, too well."
Shakespeare,"Why, this is the world's soul, and just of the"
Shakespeare,same piece
Shakespeare,Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
Shakespeare,"His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in"
Shakespeare,"My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,"
Shakespeare,"And kept his credit with his purse,"
Shakespeare,"Supported his estate, nay, Timon's money"
Shakespeare,"Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,"
Shakespeare,"But Timon's silver treads upon his lip,"
Shakespeare,"And yet--O, see the monstrousness of man"
Shakespeare,When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--
Shakespeare,"He does deny him, in respect of his,"
Shakespeare,What charitable men afford to beggars.
Shakespeare,Religion groans at it.
Shakespeare,"I never tasted Timon in my life,"
Shakespeare,"Nor came any of his bounties over me,"
Shakespeare,"To mark me for his friend, yet, I protest,"
Shakespeare,"For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue"
Shakespeare,"And honourable carriage,"
Shakespeare,"Had his necessity made use of me,"
Shakespeare,"I would have put my wealth into donation,"
Shakespeare,"And the best half should have return'd to him,"
Shakespeare,"So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,"
Shakespeare,"Men must learn now with pity to dispense,"
Shakespeare,For policy sits above conscience.
Shakespeare,SCENE III. A room in Sempronius' house.
Shakespeare,"Enter SEMPRONIUS, and a Servant of TIMON's"
Shakespeare,"Must he needs trouble me in 't,--hum!--'bove"
Shakespeare,all others?
Shakespeare,"He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus,"
Shakespeare,"And now Ventidius is wealthy too,"
Shakespeare,Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these
Shakespeare,Owe their estates unto him.
Shakespeare,"They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for"
Shakespeare,They have au denied him.
Shakespeare,How! have they denied him?
Shakespeare,Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
Shakespeare,And does he send to me? Three? hum!
Shakespeare,It shows but little love or judgment in him:
Shakespeare,"Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like"
Shakespeare,"physicians,"
Shakespeare,"Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?"
Shakespeare,"Has much disgraced me in't, I'm angry at him,"
Shakespeare,"That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,"
Shakespeare,"But his occasion might have woo'd me first,"
Shakespeare,"For, in my conscience, I was the first man"
Shakespeare,That e'er received gift from him:
Shakespeare,"And does he think so backwardly of me now,"
Shakespeare,That I'll requite its last? No:
Shakespeare,So it may prove an argument of laughter
Shakespeare,"To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool."
Shakespeare,"I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,"
Shakespeare,"Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake,"
Shakespeare,"I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,"
Shakespeare,"And with their faint reply this answer join,"
Shakespeare,Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.
Shakespeare,Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The
Shakespeare,devil knew not what he did when he made man
Shakespeare,"politic, he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot"
Shakespeare,"think but, in the end, the villainies of man will"
Shakespeare,set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to
Shakespeare,"appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,"
Shakespeare,like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
Shakespeare,whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his
Shakespeare,politic love.
Shakespeare,"This was my lord's best hope, now all are fled,"
Shakespeare,"Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,"
Shakespeare,"Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards"
Shakespeare,Many a bounteous year must be employ'd
Shakespeare,Now to guard sure their master.
Shakespeare,"And this is all a liberal course allows,"
Shakespeare,Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.
Shakespeare,SCENE IV. The same. A hall in Timon's house.
Shakespeare,"Enter two Servants of Varro, and the Servant of  LUCIUS, meeting TITUS, HORTENSIUS, and other Servants of TIMON's creditors, waiting his coming out"
Shakespeare,Varro's
Shakespeare,Varro's
Shakespeare,Varro's
Shakespeare,Varro's
Shakespeare,Varro's
Shakespeare,Varro's
Shakespeare,Varro's
Shakespeare,Varro's
Shakespeare,"Well met, good morrow, Titus and Hortensius."
Shakespeare,The like to you kind Varro.
Shakespeare,"What, do we meet together?"
Shakespeare,"Lucilius' Servant	Ay, and I think"
Shakespeare,"One business does command us all, for mine Is money."
Shakespeare,So is theirs and ours.
Shakespeare,Enter PHILOTUS
Shakespeare,Lucilius' Servant	And Sir Philotus too!
Shakespeare,Good day at once.
Shakespeare,"Lucilius' Servant	                  Welcome, good brother."
Shakespeare,What do you think the hour?
Shakespeare,Labouring for nine.
Shakespeare,Lucilius' Servant	So much?
Shakespeare,Is not my lord seen yet?
Shakespeare,Lucilius' Servant	Not yet.
Shakespeare,"I wonder on't, he was wont to shine at seven."
Shakespeare,"Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:"
Shakespeare,You must consider that a prodigal course
Shakespeare,"Is like the sun's, but not, like his, recoverable."
Shakespeare,"I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse,"
Shakespeare,"That is one may reach deep enough, and yet"
Shakespeare,Find little.
Shakespeare,I am of your fear for that.
Shakespeare,I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
Shakespeare,Your lord sends now for money.
Shakespeare,"Most true, he does."
Shakespeare,"And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,"
Shakespeare,For which I wait for money.
Shakespeare,It is against my heart.
Shakespeare,"Lucilius' Servant	Mark, how strange it shows,"
Shakespeare,Timon in this should pay more than he owes:
Shakespeare,"And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,"
Shakespeare,And send for money for 'em.
Shakespeare,"I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:"
Shakespeare,"I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,"
Shakespeare,And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.
Shakespeare,"Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?"
Shakespeare,Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand mine.
Shakespeare,"'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,"
Shakespeare,"Your master's confidence was above mine,"
Shakespeare,"Else, surely, his had equall'd."
Shakespeare,Enter FLAMINIUS.
Shakespeare,One of Lord Timon's men.
Shakespeare,"Lucilius' Servant	Flaminius! Sir, a word: pray, is my lord ready to"
Shakespeare,come forth?
Shakespeare,"No, indeed, he is not."
Shakespeare,"We attend his lordship, pray, signify so much."
Shakespeare,"I need not tell him that, he knows you are too diligent."
Shakespeare,"Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak, muffled"
Shakespeare,Lucilius' Servant	Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?
Shakespeare,"He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him."
Shakespeare,"Do you hear, sir?"
Shakespeare,"By your leave, sir,--"
Shakespeare,"What do ye ask of me, my friend?"
Shakespeare,"We wait for certain money here, sir."
Shakespeare,"If money were as certain as your waiting,"
Shakespeare,'Twere sure enough.
Shakespeare,"Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,"
Shakespeare,When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?
Shakespeare,Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
Shakespeare,And take down the interest into their
Shakespeare,gluttonous maws.
Shakespeare,"You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up,"
Shakespeare,Let me pass quietly:
Shakespeare,"Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end,"
Shakespeare,"I have no more to reckon, he to spend."
Shakespeare,"Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but this answer will not serve."
Shakespeare,"If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you,"
Shakespeare,For you serve knaves.
Shakespeare,How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?
Shakespeare,"No matter what, he's poor, and that's revenge"
Shakespeare,enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no
Shakespeare,house to put his head in? such may rail against
Shakespeare,great buildings.
Shakespeare,"O, here's Servilius, now we shall know some answer."
Shakespeare,"If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some"
Shakespeare,"other hour, I should derive much from't, for,"
Shakespeare,"take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to"
Shakespeare,"discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him,"
Shakespeare,"he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber."
Shakespeare,Lucilius' Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not sick:
Shakespeare,"And, if it be so far beyond his health,"
Shakespeare,"Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,"
Shakespeare,And make a clear way to the gods.
Shakespeare,Good gods!
Shakespeare,"We cannot take this for answer, sir."
Shakespeare,"[Within]  Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!"
Shakespeare,"Enter TIMON, in a rage, FLAMINIUS following"
Shakespeare,"What, are my doors opposed against my passage?"
Shakespeare,"Have I been ever free, and must my house"
Shakespeare,"Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?"
Shakespeare,"The place which I have feasted, does it now,"
Shakespeare,"Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?"
Shakespeare,"Lucilius' Servant	Put in now, Titus."
Shakespeare,"My lord, here is my bill."
Shakespeare,Lucilius' Servant	Here's mine.
Shakespeare,"And mine, my lord."
Shakespeare,Both
Shakespeare,"Varro's Servants	And ours, my lord."
Shakespeare,All our bills.
Shakespeare,Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.
Shakespeare,"Lucilius' Servant	Alas, my lord,-"
Shakespeare,Cut my heart in sums.
Shakespeare,"Mine, fifty talents."
Shakespeare,Tell out my blood.
Shakespeare,"Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand crowns, my lord."
Shakespeare,Five thousand drops pays that.
Shakespeare,What yours?--and yours?
Shakespeare,"Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!"
Shakespeare,"'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps"
Shakespeare,at their money: these debts may well be called
Shakespeare,"desperate ones, for a madman owes 'em."
Shakespeare,"They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves."
Shakespeare,Creditors? devils!
Shakespeare,"My dear lord,--"
Shakespeare,What if it should be so?
Shakespeare,I'll have it so. My steward!
Shakespeare,"So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again,"
Shakespeare,"Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius:"
Shakespeare,"All, sirrah, all:"
Shakespeare,I'll once more feast the rascals.
Shakespeare,"You only speak from your distracted soul,"
Shakespeare,"There is not so much left, to furnish out"
Shakespeare,A moderate table.
Shakespeare,"Be't not in thy care, go,"
Shakespeare,"I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tide"
Shakespeare,"Of knaves once more, my cook and I'll provide."
Shakespeare,SCENE V. The same. The senate-house. The Senate sitting.
Shakespeare,"My lord, you have my voice to it, the fault's"
Shakespeare,"Bloody, 'tis necessary he should die:"
Shakespeare,Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.
Shakespeare,"Most true, the law shall bruise him."
Shakespeare,"Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants"
Shakespeare,"Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!"
Shakespeare,"Now, captain?"
Shakespeare,"I am an humble suitor to your virtues,"
Shakespeare,"For pity is the virtue of the law,"
Shakespeare,And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
Shakespeare,It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
Shakespeare,"Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,"
Shakespeare,"Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth"
Shakespeare,"To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't."
Shakespeare,"He is a man, setting his fate aside,"
Shakespeare,Of comely virtues:
Shakespeare,Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--
Shakespeare,An honour in him which buys out his fault--
Shakespeare,"But with a noble fury and fair spirit,"
Shakespeare,"Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,"
Shakespeare,He did oppose his foe:
Shakespeare,And with such sober and unnoted passion
Shakespeare,"He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,"
Shakespeare,As if he had but proved an argument.
Shakespeare,"You undergo too strict a paradox,"
Shakespeare,Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:
Shakespeare,Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
Shakespeare,To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
Shakespeare,"Upon the head of valour, which indeed"
Shakespeare,Is valour misbegot and came into the world
Shakespeare,When sects and factions were newly born:
Shakespeare,He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
Shakespeare,"The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs"
Shakespeare,"His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,"
Shakespeare,"carelessly,"
Shakespeare,"And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,"
Shakespeare,To bring it into danger.
Shakespeare,"If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,"
Shakespeare,What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!
Shakespeare,You cannot make gross sins look clear:
Shakespeare,"To revenge is no valour, but to bear."
Shakespeare,"My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,"
Shakespeare,If I speak like a captain.
Shakespeare,"Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,"
Shakespeare,"And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,"
Shakespeare,"And let the foes quietly cut their throats,"
Shakespeare,Without repugnancy? If there be
Shakespeare,"Such valour in the bearing, what make we"
Shakespeare,"Abroad? why then, women are more valiant"
Shakespeare,"That stay at home, if bearing carry it,"
Shakespeare,"And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon"
Shakespeare,"Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,"
Shakespeare,"If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,"
Shakespeare,"As you are great, be pitifully good:"
Shakespeare,Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
Shakespeare,"To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust,"
Shakespeare,"But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just."
Shakespeare,"To be in anger is impiety,"
Shakespeare,But who is man that is not angry?
Shakespeare,Weigh but the crime with this.
Shakespeare,You breathe in vain.
Shakespeare,In vain! his service done
Shakespeare,At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
Shakespeare,Were a sufficient briber for his life.
Shakespeare,"I say, my lords, he has done fair service,"
Shakespeare,And slain in fight many of your enemies:
Shakespeare,How full of valour did he bear himself
Shakespeare,"In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!"
Shakespeare,"He has made too much plenty with 'em,"
Shakespeare,He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often
Shakespeare,"Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:"
Shakespeare,"If there were no foes, that were enough"
Shakespeare,To overcome him: in that beastly fury
Shakespeare,"He has been known to commit outrages,"
Shakespeare,"And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,"
Shakespeare,His days are foul and his drink dangerous.
Shakespeare,He dies.
Shakespeare,Hard fate! he might have died in war.
Shakespeare,"My lords, if not for any parts in him--"
Shakespeare,Though his right arm might purchase his own time
Shakespeare,"And be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,"
Shakespeare,"Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:"
Shakespeare,"And, for I know your reverend ages love"
Shakespeare,"Security, I'll pawn my victories, all"
Shakespeare,"My honours to you, upon his good returns."
Shakespeare,"If by this crime he owes the law his life,"
Shakespeare,"Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore"
Shakespeare,"For law is strict, and war is nothing more."
Shakespeare,"We are for law: he dies, urge it no more,"
Shakespeare,"On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,"
Shakespeare,He forfeits his own blood that spills another.
Shakespeare,"Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,"
Shakespeare,"I do beseech you, know me."
Shakespeare,Call me to your remembrances.
Shakespeare,What!
Shakespeare,"I cannot think but your age has forgot me,"
Shakespeare,"It could not else be, I should prove so base,"
Shakespeare,"To sue, and be denied such common grace:"
Shakespeare,My wounds ache at you.
Shakespeare,Do you dare our anger?
Shakespeare,"'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect,"
Shakespeare,We banish thee for ever.
Shakespeare,Banish me!
Shakespeare,"Banish your dotage, banish usury,"
Shakespeare,That makes the senate ugly.
Shakespeare,"If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,"
Shakespeare,"Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell"
Shakespeare,"our spirit,"
Shakespeare,He shall be executed presently.
Shakespeare,Exeunt Senators
Shakespeare,"Now the gods keep you old enough, that you may live"
Shakespeare,"Only in bone, that none may look on you!"
Shakespeare,"I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,"
Shakespeare,While they have told their money and let out
Shakespeare,"Their coin upon large interest, I myself"
Shakespeare,Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
Shakespeare,Is this the balsam that the usuring senate
Shakespeare,Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!
Shakespeare,"It comes not ill, I hate not to be banish'd,"
Shakespeare,"It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,"
Shakespeare,That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up
Shakespeare,"My discontented troops, and lay for hearts."
Shakespeare,"'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds,"
Shakespeare,Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.
Shakespeare,SCENE VI. The same. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.
Shakespeare,"Music. Tables set out: Servants attending.  Enter divers Lords, Senators and others, at several doors"
Shakespeare,"The good time of day to you, sir."
Shakespeare,I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord
Shakespeare,did but try us this other day.
Shakespeare,"Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we"
Shakespeare,encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as
Shakespeare,he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.
Shakespeare,"It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting."
Shakespeare,I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest
Shakespeare,"inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me"
Shakespeare,"to put off, but he hath conjured me beyond them, and"
Shakespeare,I must needs appear.
Shakespeare,In like manner was I in debt to my importunate
Shakespeare,"business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am"
Shakespeare,"sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my"
Shakespeare,provision was out.
Shakespeare,"I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all"
Shakespeare,things go.
Shakespeare,Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of
Shakespeare,A thousand pieces.
Shakespeare,A thousand pieces!
Shakespeare,What of you?
Shakespeare,"He sent to me, sir,--Here he comes."
Shakespeare,Enter TIMON and Attendants
Shakespeare,"With all my heart, gentlemen both, and how fare you?"
Shakespeare,"Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship."
Shakespeare,The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  Nor more willingly leaves winter, such"
Shakespeare,"summer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not"
Shakespeare,recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the
Shakespeare,"music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the"
Shakespeare,"trumpet's sound, we shall to 't presently."
Shakespeare,I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship
Shakespeare,that I returned you an empty messenger.
Shakespeare,"O, sir, let it not trouble you."
Shakespeare,"Ah, my good friend, what cheer?"
Shakespeare,"My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,"
Shakespeare,"that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,"
Shakespeare,I was so unfortunate a beggar.
Shakespeare,"Think not on 't, sir."
Shakespeare,"If you had sent but two hours before,--"
Shakespeare,Let it not cumber your better remembrance.
Shakespeare,The banquet brought in
Shakespeare,"Come, bring in all together."
Shakespeare,All covered dishes!
Shakespeare,"Royal cheer, I warrant you."
Shakespeare,"Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield"
Shakespeare,How do you? What's the news?
Shakespeare,Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?
Shakespeare,Alcibiades banished!
Shakespeare,"'Tis so, be sure of it."
Shakespeare,How! how!
Shakespeare,"I pray you, upon what?"
Shakespeare,"My worthy friends, will you draw near?"
Shakespeare,I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.
Shakespeare,This is the old man still.
Shakespeare,Will 't hold? will 't hold?
Shakespeare,It does: but time will--and so--
Shakespeare,I do conceive.
Shakespeare,"Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to"
Shakespeare,the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all
Shakespeare,"places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let"
Shakespeare,the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:
Shakespeare,"sit, sit. The gods require our thanks."
Shakespeare,"You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with"
Shakespeare,"thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves"
Shakespeare,"praised: but reserve still to give, lest your"
Shakespeare,"deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that"
Shakespeare,"one need not lend to another, for, were your"
Shakespeare,"godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the"
Shakespeare,gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man
Shakespeare,that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without
Shakespeare,a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at
Shakespeare,"the table, let a dozen of them be--as they are. The"
Shakespeare,"rest of your fees, O gods--the senators of Athens,"
Shakespeare,together with the common lag of people--what is
Shakespeare,"amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for"
Shakespeare,"destruction. For these my present friends, as they"
Shakespeare,"are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to"
Shakespeare,nothing are they welcome.
Shakespeare,"Uncover, dogs, and lap."
Shakespeare,The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of warm water
Shakespeare,What does his lordship mean?
Shakespeare,"May you a better feast never behold,"
Shakespeare,You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water
Shakespeare,"Is your perfection. This is Timon's last,"
Shakespeare,"Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,"
Shakespeare,"Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces"
Shakespeare,Your reeking villany.
Shakespeare,Throwing the water in their faces
Shakespeare,"Live loathed and long,"
Shakespeare,"Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,"
Shakespeare,"Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,"
Shakespeare,"You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,"
Shakespeare,"Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!"
Shakespeare,Of man and beast the infinite malady
Shakespeare,"Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?"
Shakespeare,"Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou,--"
Shakespeare,"Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none."
Shakespeare,"Throws the dishes at them, and drives them out"
Shakespeare,"What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,"
Shakespeare,Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.
Shakespeare,"Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated be"
Shakespeare,Of Timon man and all humanity!
Shakespeare,"Re-enter the Lords, Senators,  and c"
Shakespeare,Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?
Shakespeare,Push! did you see my cap?
Shakespeare,I have lost my gown.
Shakespeare,"He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him."
Shakespeare,"He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has"
Shakespeare,beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?
Shakespeare,Did you see my cap?
Shakespeare,Here 'tis.
Shakespeare,Here lies my gown.
Shakespeare,Let's make no stay.
Shakespeare,Lord Timon's mad.
Shakespeare,I feel 't upon my bones.
Shakespeare,"One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Without the walls of Athens.
Shakespeare,Enter TIMON
Shakespeare,"Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,"
Shakespeare,"That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,"
Shakespeare,"And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!"
Shakespeare,"Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,"
Shakespeare,"Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,"
Shakespeare,And minister in their steads! to general filths
Shakespeare,"Convert o' the instant, green virginity,"
Shakespeare,"Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast,"
Shakespeare,"Rather than render back, out with your knives,"
Shakespeare,"And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!"
Shakespeare,"Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,"
Shakespeare,"And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed,"
Shakespeare,"Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,"
Shakespeare,"pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,"
Shakespeare,"With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,"
Shakespeare,"Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,"
Shakespeare,"Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,"
Shakespeare,"Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,"
Shakespeare,"Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,"
Shakespeare,"Decline to your confounding contraries,"
Shakespeare,"And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,"
Shakespeare,Your potent and infectious fevers heap
Shakespeare,"On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,"
Shakespeare,"Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt"
Shakespeare,As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty
Shakespeare,"Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,"
Shakespeare,"That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,"
Shakespeare,"And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,"
Shakespeare,"Sow all the Athenian bosoms, and their crop"
Shakespeare,"Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,"
Shakespeare,"at their society, as their friendship, may"
Shakespeare,"merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,"
Shakespeare,"But nakedness, thou detestable town!"
Shakespeare,"Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!"
Shakespeare,"Timon will to the woods, where he shall find"
Shakespeare,The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
Shakespeare,"The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--"
Shakespeare,The Athenians both within and out that wall!
Shakespeare,"And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow"
Shakespeare,"To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen."
Shakespeare,SCENE II. Athens. A room in Timon's house.
Shakespeare,"Enter FLAVIUS, with two or three Servants"
Shakespeare,"Hear you, master steward, where's our master?"
Shakespeare,Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?
Shakespeare,"Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?"
Shakespeare,"Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,"
Shakespeare,I am as poor as you.
Shakespeare,Such a house broke!
Shakespeare,So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not
Shakespeare,"One friend to take his fortune by the arm,"
Shakespeare,And go along with him!
Shakespeare,As we do turn our backs
Shakespeare,"From our companion thrown into his grave,"
Shakespeare,So his familiars to his buried fortunes
Shakespeare,"Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,"
Shakespeare,"Like empty purses pick'd, and his poor self,"
Shakespeare,"A dedicated beggar to the air,"
Shakespeare,"With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,"
Shakespeare,"Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows."
Shakespeare,Enter other Servants
Shakespeare,All broken implements of a ruin'd house.
Shakespeare,"Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery,"
Shakespeare,"That see I by our faces, we are fellows still,"
Shakespeare,"Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark,"
Shakespeare,"And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,"
Shakespeare,Hearing the surges threat: we must all part
Shakespeare,Into this sea of air.
Shakespeare,"Good fellows all,"
Shakespeare,The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.
Shakespeare,"Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,"
Shakespeare,"Let's yet be fellows, let's shake our heads, and say,"
Shakespeare,"As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,"
Shakespeare,"'We have seen better days.' Let each take some,"
Shakespeare,"Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:"
Shakespeare,"Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor."
Shakespeare,"Servants embrace, and part several ways"
Shakespeare,"O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!"
Shakespeare,"Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,"
Shakespeare,Since riches point to misery and contempt?
Shakespeare,Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live
Shakespeare,But in a dream of friendship?
Shakespeare,To have his pomp and all what state compounds
Shakespeare,"But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?"
Shakespeare,"Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,"
Shakespeare,"Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,"
Shakespeare,"When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!"
Shakespeare,"Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?"
Shakespeare,"For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men."
Shakespeare,"My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,"
Shakespeare,"Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes"
Shakespeare,"Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!"
Shakespeare,He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
Shakespeare,"Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to"
Shakespeare,"Supply his life, or that which can command it."
Shakespeare,I'll follow and inquire him out:
Shakespeare,"I'll ever serve his mind with my best will,"
Shakespeare,"Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still."
Shakespeare,"SCENE III. Woods and cave, near the seashore."
Shakespeare,"Enter TIMON, from the cave"
Shakespeare,"O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth"
Shakespeare,"Rotten humidity, below thy sister's orb"
Shakespeare,"Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,"
Shakespeare,"Whose procreation, residence, and birth,"
Shakespeare,"Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes,"
Shakespeare,"The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,"
Shakespeare,"To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,"
Shakespeare,But by contempt of nature.
Shakespeare,"Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord,"
Shakespeare,"The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,"
Shakespeare,The beggar native honour.
Shakespeare,"It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,"
Shakespeare,"The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,"
Shakespeare,"In purity of manhood stand upright,"
Shakespeare,"And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,"
Shakespeare,"So are they all, for every grise of fortune"
Shakespeare,Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate
Shakespeare,"Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique,"
Shakespeare,"There's nothing level in our cursed natures,"
Shakespeare,"But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd"
Shakespeare,"All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!"
Shakespeare,"His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:"
Shakespeare,"Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!"
Shakespeare,Digging
Shakespeare,Digging
Shakespeare,"Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate"
Shakespeare,With thy most operant poison! What is here?
Shakespeare,"Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,"
Shakespeare,"I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!"
Shakespeare,"Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,"
Shakespeare,"Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant."
Shakespeare,"Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this"
Shakespeare,"Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,"
Shakespeare,Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:
Shakespeare,This yellow slave
Shakespeare,"Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,"
Shakespeare,"Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves"
Shakespeare,"And give them title, knee and approbation"
Shakespeare,With senators on the bench: this is it
Shakespeare,"That makes the wappen'd widow wed again,"
Shakespeare,"She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores"
Shakespeare,"Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices"
Shakespeare,"To the April day again. Come, damned earth,"
Shakespeare,"Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds"
Shakespeare,"Among the route of nations, I will make thee"
Shakespeare,Do thy right nature.
Shakespeare,March afar off
Shakespeare,"Ha! a drum ? Thou'rt quick,"
Shakespeare,"But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,"
Shakespeare,When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.
Shakespeare,"Nay, stay thou out for earnest."
Shakespeare,Keeping some gold
Shakespeare,"Enter ALCIBIADES, with drum and fife, in warlike manner, PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA"
Shakespeare,What art thou there? speak.
Shakespeare,"A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,"
Shakespeare,For showing me again the eyes of man!
Shakespeare,"What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,"
Shakespeare,That art thyself a man?
Shakespeare,"I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind."
Shakespeare,"For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,"
Shakespeare,That I might love thee something.
Shakespeare,"I know thee well,"
Shakespeare,But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.
Shakespeare,"I know thee too, and more than that I know thee,"
Shakespeare,"I not desire to know. Follow thy drum,"
Shakespeare,"With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:"
Shakespeare,"Religious canons, civil laws are cruel,"
Shakespeare,Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine
Shakespeare,"Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,"
Shakespeare,For all her cherubim look.
Shakespeare,Thy lips rot off!
Shakespeare,"I will not kiss thee, then the rot returns"
Shakespeare,To thine own lips again.
Shakespeare,How came the noble Timon to this change?
Shakespeare,"As the moon does, by wanting light to give:"
Shakespeare,"But then renew I could not, like the moon,"
Shakespeare,There were no suns to borrow of.
Shakespeare,"Noble Timon,"
Shakespeare,What friendship may I do thee?
Shakespeare,"None, but to"
Shakespeare,Maintain my opinion.
Shakespeare,"What is it, Timon?"
Shakespeare,"Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thou"
Shakespeare,"wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art"
Shakespeare,"a man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, for"
Shakespeare,thou art a man!
Shakespeare,I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.
Shakespeare,"Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity."
Shakespeare,"I see them now, then was a blessed time."
Shakespeare,"As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots."
Shakespeare,"Is this the Athenian minion, whom the world"
Shakespeare,Voiced so regardfully?
Shakespeare,Art thou Timandra?
Shakespeare,"Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee,"
Shakespeare,"Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust."
Shakespeare,Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves
Shakespeare,"For tubs and baths, bring down rose-cheeked youth"
Shakespeare,To the tub-fast and the diet.
Shakespeare,"Hang thee, monster!"
Shakespeare,"Pardon him, sweet Timandra, for his wits"
Shakespeare,Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.
Shakespeare,"I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,"
Shakespeare,The want whereof doth daily make revolt
Shakespeare,"In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,"
Shakespeare,"How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,"
Shakespeare,"Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,"
Shakespeare,"But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--"
Shakespeare,"I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone."
Shakespeare,"I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon."
Shakespeare,How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
Shakespeare,I had rather be alone.
Shakespeare,"Why, fare thee well:"
Shakespeare,Here is some gold for thee.
Shakespeare,"Keep it, I cannot eat it."
Shakespeare,"When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,--"
Shakespeare,Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?
Shakespeare,"Ay, Timon, and have cause."
Shakespeare,"The gods confound them all in thy conquest,"
Shakespeare,"And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!"
Shakespeare,"Why me, Timon?"
Shakespeare,"That, by killing of villains,"
Shakespeare,Thou wast born to conquer my country.
Shakespeare,"Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on,"
Shakespeare,"Be as a planetary plague, when Jove"
Shakespeare,Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison
Shakespeare,In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:
Shakespeare,"Pity not honour'd age for his white beard,"
Shakespeare,"He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron,"
Shakespeare,"It is her habit only that is honest,"
Shakespeare,Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek
Shakespeare,"Make soft thy trenchant sword, for those milk-paps,"
Shakespeare,"That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,"
Shakespeare,"Are not within the leaf of pity writ,"
Shakespeare,"But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,"
Shakespeare,"Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy,"
Shakespeare,"Think it a bastard, whom the oracle"
Shakespeare,"Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,"
Shakespeare,"And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects,"
Shakespeare,"Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes,"
Shakespeare,"Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,"
Shakespeare,"Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,"
Shakespeare,Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:
Shakespeare,"Make large confusion, and, thy fury spent,"
Shakespeare,"Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone."
Shakespeare,Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou
Shakespeare,"givest me,"
Shakespeare,Not all thy counsel.
Shakespeare,"Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse"
Shakespeare,upon thee!
Shakespeare,"Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?"
Shakespeare,"Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,"
Shakespeare,"And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,"
Shakespeare,"Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,"
Shakespeare,"Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swear"
Shakespeare,Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
Shakespeare,"The immortal gods that hear you,--spare your oaths,"
Shakespeare,"I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still,"
Shakespeare,"And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,"
Shakespeare,"Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up,"
Shakespeare,"Let your close fire predominate his smoke,"
Shakespeare,"And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,"
Shakespeare,Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs
Shakespeare,"With burthens of the dead,--some that were hang'd,"
Shakespeare,"No matter:--wear them, betray with them: whore still,"
Shakespeare,"Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,"
Shakespeare,A pox of wrinkles!
Shakespeare,"Well, more gold: what then?"
Shakespeare,"Believe't, that we'll do any thing for gold."
Shakespeare,Consumptions sow
Shakespeare,"In hollow bones of man, strike their sharp shins,"
Shakespeare,"And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,"
Shakespeare,"That he may never more false title plead,"
Shakespeare,"Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,"
Shakespeare,"That scolds against the quality of flesh,"
Shakespeare,"And not believes himself: down with the nose,"
Shakespeare,"Down with it flat, take the bridge quite away"
Shakespeare,"Of him that, his particular to foresee,"
Shakespeare,Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate
Shakespeare,"ruffians bald,"
Shakespeare,And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
Shakespeare,"Derive some pain from you: plague all,"
Shakespeare,That your activity may defeat and quell
Shakespeare,The source of all erection. There's more gold:
Shakespeare,"Do you damn others, and let this damn you,"
Shakespeare,And ditches grave you all!
Shakespeare,"More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon."
Shakespeare,"More whore, more mischief first, I have given you earnest."
Shakespeare,"Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon:"
Shakespeare,"If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again."
Shakespeare,"If I hope well, I'll never see thee more."
Shakespeare,I never did thee harm.
Shakespeare,"Yes, thou spokest well of me."
Shakespeare,Call'st thou that harm?
Shakespeare,"Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take"
Shakespeare,Thy beagles with thee.
Shakespeare,We but offend him. Strike!
Shakespeare,"Drum beats. Exeunt ALCIBIADES, PHRYNIA, and TIMANDRA"
Shakespeare,"That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,"
Shakespeare,"Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,"
Shakespeare,"Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast,"
Shakespeare,"Teems, and feeds all, whose self-same mettle,"
Shakespeare,"Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,"
Shakespeare,"Engenders the black toad and adder blue,"
Shakespeare,"The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,"
Shakespeare,With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven
Shakespeare,"Whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine,"
Shakespeare,"Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,"
Shakespeare,"From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!"
Shakespeare,"Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,"
Shakespeare,Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!
Shakespeare,"Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears,"
Shakespeare,"Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face"
Shakespeare,Hath to the marbled mansion all above
Shakespeare,"Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--"
Shakespeare,"Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas,"
Shakespeare,"Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughts"
Shakespeare,"And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,"
Shakespeare,That from it all consideration slips!
Shakespeare,"More man? plague, plague!"
Shakespeare,I was directed hither: men report
Shakespeare,"Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them."
Shakespeare,"'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,"
Shakespeare,Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!
Shakespeare,"This is in thee a nature but infected,"
Shakespeare,A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
Shakespeare,From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
Shakespeare,This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?
Shakespeare,"Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft,"
Shakespeare,"Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot"
Shakespeare,"That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,"
Shakespeare,By putting on the cunning of a carper.
Shakespeare,"Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive"
Shakespeare,"By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,"
Shakespeare,"And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,"
Shakespeare,"Blow off thy cap, praise his most vicious strain,"
Shakespeare,"And call it excellent: thou wast told thus,"
Shakespeare,Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
Shakespeare,To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just
Shakespeare,"That thou turn rascal, hadst thou wealth again,"
Shakespeare,Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.
Shakespeare,"Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself."
Shakespeare,"Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself,"
Shakespeare,"A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st"
Shakespeare,"That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,"
Shakespeare,"Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,"
Shakespeare,"That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,"
Shakespeare,And skip where thou point'st out? will the
Shakespeare,"cold brook,"
Shakespeare,"Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,"
Shakespeare,To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures
Shakespeare,Whose naked natures live in an the spite
Shakespeare,"Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,"
Shakespeare,"To the conflicting elements exposed,"
Shakespeare,"Answer mere nature, bid them flatter thee,"
Shakespeare,"O, thou shalt find--"
Shakespeare,A fool of thee: depart.
Shakespeare,I love thee better now than e'er I did.
Shakespeare,I hate thee worse.
Shakespeare,Thou flatter'st misery.
Shakespeare,"I flatter not, but say thou art a caitiff."
Shakespeare,Why dost thou seek me out?
Shakespeare,To vex thee.
Shakespeare,Always a villain's office or a fool's.
Shakespeare,Dost please thyself in't?
Shakespeare,What! a knave too?
Shakespeare,If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
Shakespeare,"To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou"
Shakespeare,"Dost it enforcedly, thou'ldst courtier be again,"
Shakespeare,Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
Shakespeare,"Outlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before:"
Shakespeare,"The one is filling still, never complete,"
Shakespeare,"The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,"
Shakespeare,"Hath a distracted and most wretched being,"
Shakespeare,"Worse than the worst, content."
Shakespeare,"Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable."
Shakespeare,Not by his breath that is more miserable.
Shakespeare,"Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm"
Shakespeare,"With favour never clasp'd, but bred a dog."
Shakespeare,"Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded"
Shakespeare,The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
Shakespeare,To such as may the passive drugs of it
Shakespeare,"Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself"
Shakespeare,"In general riot, melted down thy youth"
Shakespeare,"In different beds of lust, and never learn'd"
Shakespeare,"The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd"
Shakespeare,"The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,"
Shakespeare,"Who had the world as my confectionary,"
Shakespeare,"The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men"
Shakespeare,"At duty, more than I could frame employment,"
Shakespeare,That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
Shakespeare,"Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush"
Shakespeare,"Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare"
Shakespeare,"For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,"
Shakespeare,"That never knew but better, is some burden:"
Shakespeare,"Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time"
Shakespeare,Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
Shakespeare,They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?
Shakespeare,"If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,"
Shakespeare,"Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff"
Shakespeare,To some she beggar and compounded thee
Shakespeare,"Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!"
Shakespeare,"If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,"
Shakespeare,Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.
Shakespeare,Art thou proud yet?
Shakespeare,"Ay, that I am not thee."
Shakespeare,"I, that I was"
Shakespeare,No prodigal.
Shakespeare,"I, that I am one now:"
Shakespeare,"Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,"
Shakespeare,I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.
Shakespeare,That the whole life of Athens were in this!
Shakespeare,Thus would I eat it.
Shakespeare,Eating a root
Shakespeare,"Here, I will mend thy feast."
Shakespeare,Offering him a root
Shakespeare,"First mend my company, take away thyself."
Shakespeare,"So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine."
Shakespeare,"'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd,"
Shakespeare,"if not, I would it were."
Shakespeare,What wouldst thou have to Athens?
Shakespeare,"Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,"
Shakespeare,"Tell them there I have gold, look, so I have."
Shakespeare,Here is no use for gold.
Shakespeare,"The best and truest,"
Shakespeare,"For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm."
Shakespeare,"Where liest o' nights, Timon?"
Shakespeare,Under that's above me.
Shakespeare,"Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?"
Shakespeare,"Where my stomach finds meat, or, rather, where I eat"
Shakespeare,Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!
Shakespeare,Where wouldst thou send it?
Shakespeare,To sauce thy dishes.
Shakespeare,"The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the"
Shakespeare,extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt
Shakespeare,"and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much"
Shakespeare,"curiosity, in thy rags thou knowest none, but art"
Shakespeare,despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for
Shakespeare,"thee, eat it."
Shakespeare,On what I hate I feed not.
Shakespeare,Dost hate a medlar?
Shakespeare,"Ay, though it look like thee."
Shakespeare,"An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst"
Shakespeare,have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou
Shakespeare,ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?
Shakespeare,"Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thou"
Shakespeare,ever know beloved?
Shakespeare,Myself.
Shakespeare,"I understand thee, thou hadst some means to keep a"
Shakespeare,dog.
Shakespeare,What things in the world canst thou nearest compare
Shakespeare,to thy flatterers?
Shakespeare,"Women nearest, but men, men are the things"
Shakespeare,"themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,"
Shakespeare,"Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?"
Shakespeare,"Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men."
Shakespeare,Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of
Shakespeare,"men, and remain a beast with the beasts?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, Timon."
Shakespeare,"A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'"
Shakespeare,"attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would"
Shakespeare,"beguile thee, if thou wert the lamb, the fox would"
Shakespeare,"eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would"
Shakespeare,"suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by"
Shakespeare,"the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would"
Shakespeare,"torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a"
Shakespeare,"breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy"
Shakespeare,"greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst"
Shakespeare,hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the
Shakespeare,"unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and"
Shakespeare,make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert
Shakespeare,"thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse:"
Shakespeare,"wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the"
Shakespeare,"leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to"
Shakespeare,the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
Shakespeare,thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy
Shakespeare,"defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that"
Shakespeare,were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art
Shakespeare,"thou already, that seest not thy loss in"
Shakespeare,transformation!
Shakespeare,"If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou"
Shakespeare,mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of
Shakespeare,Athens is become a forest of beasts.
Shakespeare,"How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?"
Shakespeare,Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of
Shakespeare,company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it
Shakespeare,"and give way: when I know not what else to do, I'll"
Shakespeare,see thee again.
Shakespeare,"When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be"
Shakespeare,welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.
Shakespeare,Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.
Shakespeare,Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
Shakespeare,A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
Shakespeare,All villains that do stand by thee are pure.
Shakespeare,There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.
Shakespeare,If I name thee.
Shakespeare,"I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands."
Shakespeare,I would my tongue could rot them off!
Shakespeare,"Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!"
Shakespeare,"Choler does kill me that thou art alive,"
Shakespeare,I swound to see thee.
Shakespeare,Would thou wouldst burst!
Shakespeare,Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose
Shakespeare,A stone by thee.
Shakespeare,Throws a stone at him
Shakespeare,Beast!
Shakespeare,Slave!
Shakespeare,Toad!
Shakespeare,"Rogue, rogue, rogue!"
Shakespeare,"I am sick of this false world, and will love nought"
Shakespeare,But even the mere necessities upon 't.
Shakespeare,"Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave,"
Shakespeare,Lie where the light foam the sea may beat
Shakespeare,"Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,"
Shakespeare,That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
Shakespeare,To the gold
Shakespeare,"O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce"
Shakespeare,'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
Shakespeare,Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
Shakespeare,"Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,"
Shakespeare,Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
Shakespeare,"That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,"
Shakespeare,"That solder'st close impossibilities,"
Shakespeare,And makest them kiss! that speak'st with
Shakespeare,"every tongue,"
Shakespeare,To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!
Shakespeare,"Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue"
Shakespeare,"Set them into confounding odds, that beasts"
Shakespeare,May have the world in empire!
Shakespeare,Would 'twere so!
Shakespeare,But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:
Shakespeare,Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.
Shakespeare,Throng'd to!
Shakespeare,"Thy back, I prithee."
Shakespeare,"Live, and love thy misery."
Shakespeare,"Long live so, and so die."
Shakespeare,Exit APEMANTUS
Shakespeare,I am quit.
Shakespeare,"Moe things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them."
Shakespeare,Enter Banditti
Shakespeare,Where should he have this gold? It is some poor
Shakespeare,"fragment, some slender sort of his remainder: the"
Shakespeare,"mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his"
Shakespeare,"friends, drove him into this melancholy."
Shakespeare,It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
Shakespeare,Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not
Shakespeare,"for't, he will supply us easily, if he covetously"
Shakespeare,"reserve it, how shall's get it?"
Shakespeare,"True, for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid."
Shakespeare,Is not this he?
Shakespeare,'Tis his description.
Shakespeare,"He, I know him."
Shakespeare,"Save thee, Timon."
Shakespeare,"Now, thieves?"
Shakespeare,"Soldiers, not thieves."
Shakespeare,"Both too, and women's sons."
Shakespeare,"We are not thieves, but men that much do want."
Shakespeare,"Your greatest want is, you want much of meat."
Shakespeare,"Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots,"
Shakespeare,"Within this mile break forth a hundred springs,"
Shakespeare,"The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips,"
Shakespeare,"The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush"
Shakespeare,Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
Shakespeare,"We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,"
Shakespeare,As beasts and birds and fishes.
Shakespeare,"Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes,"
Shakespeare,You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
Shakespeare,"That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not"
Shakespeare,In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft
Shakespeare,"In limited professions. Rascal thieves,"
Shakespeare,"Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,"
Shakespeare,"Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,"
Shakespeare,"And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician,"
Shakespeare,"His antidotes are poison, and he slays"
Shakespeare,"Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together,"
Shakespeare,"Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,"
Shakespeare,Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.
Shakespeare,"The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction"
Shakespeare,"Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,"
Shakespeare,And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
Shakespeare,"The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves"
Shakespeare,"The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,"
Shakespeare,That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
Shakespeare,From general excrement: each thing's a thief:
Shakespeare,"The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power"
Shakespeare,"Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,"
Shakespeare,Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
Shakespeare,"All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,"
Shakespeare,"Break open shops, nothing can you steal,"
Shakespeare,But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
Shakespeare,"I give you, and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen."
Shakespeare,"Has almost charmed me from my profession, by"
Shakespeare,persuading me to it.
Shakespeare,'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises
Shakespeare,"us, not to have us thrive in our mystery."
Shakespeare,"I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade."
Shakespeare,Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no time
Shakespeare,so miserable but a man may be true.
Shakespeare,Exeunt Banditti
Shakespeare,Enter FLAVIUS
Shakespeare,Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
Shakespeare,Full of decay and failing? O monument
Shakespeare,And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!
Shakespeare,What an alteration of honour
Shakespeare,Has desperate want made!
Shakespeare,What viler thing upon the earth than friends
Shakespeare,Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
Shakespeare,"How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,"
Shakespeare,When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
Shakespeare,"Grant I may ever love, and rather woo"
Shakespeare,Those that would mischief me than those that do!
Shakespeare,Has caught me in his eye: I will present
Shakespeare,"My honest grief unto him, and, as my lord,"
Shakespeare,Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!
Shakespeare,Away! what art thou?
Shakespeare,"Have you forgot me, sir?"
Shakespeare,"Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men,"
Shakespeare,"Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee."
Shakespeare,An honest poor servant of yours.
Shakespeare,Then I know thee not:
Shakespeare,"I never had honest man about me, I, all"
Shakespeare,"I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains."
Shakespeare,"The gods are witness,"
Shakespeare,Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
Shakespeare,For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.
Shakespeare,"What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I"
Shakespeare,"love thee,"
Shakespeare,"Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st"
Shakespeare,"Flinty mankind, whose eyes do never give"
Shakespeare,But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
Shakespeare,"Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!"
Shakespeare,"I beg of you to know me, good my lord,"
Shakespeare,To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
Shakespeare,To entertain me as your steward still.
Shakespeare,Had I a steward
Shakespeare,"So true, so just, and now so comfortable?"
Shakespeare,It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
Shakespeare,"Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man"
Shakespeare,Was born of woman.
Shakespeare,"Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,"
Shakespeare,You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
Shakespeare,"One honest man--mistake me not--but one,"
Shakespeare,"No more, I pray,--and he's a steward."
Shakespeare,How fain would I have hated all mankind!
Shakespeare,"And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,"
Shakespeare,I fell with curses.
Shakespeare,"Methinks thou art more honest now than wise,"
Shakespeare,"For, by oppressing and betraying me,"
Shakespeare,Thou mightst have sooner got another service:
Shakespeare,"For many so arrive at second masters,"
Shakespeare,Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--
Shakespeare,"For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--"
Shakespeare,"Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,"
Shakespeare,"If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,"
Shakespeare,Expecting in return twenty for one?
Shakespeare,"No, my most worthy master, in whose breast"
Shakespeare,"Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:"
Shakespeare,You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:
Shakespeare,Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
Shakespeare,"That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,"
Shakespeare,"Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,"
Shakespeare,"Care of your food and living, and, believe it,"
Shakespeare,"My most honour'd lord,"
Shakespeare,"For any benefit that points to me,"
Shakespeare,"Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange"
Shakespeare,"For this one wish, that you had power and wealth"
Shakespeare,"To requite me, by making rich yourself."
Shakespeare,"Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,"
Shakespeare,"Here, take: the gods out of my misery"
Shakespeare,"Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy,"
Shakespeare,"But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men,"
Shakespeare,"Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,"
Shakespeare,"But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,"
Shakespeare,"Ere thou relieve the beggar, give to dogs"
Shakespeare,"What thou deny'st to men, let prisons swallow 'em,"
Shakespeare,"Debts wither 'em to nothing, be men like"
Shakespeare,"blasted woods,"
Shakespeare,And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
Shakespeare,And so farewell and thrive.
Shakespeare,"O, let me stay,"
Shakespeare,"And comfort you, my master."
Shakespeare,"If thou hatest curses,"
Shakespeare,"Stay not, fly, whilst thou art blest and free:"
Shakespeare,"Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee."
Shakespeare,Exit FLAVIUS. TIMON retires to his cave
Shakespeare,SCENE I. The woods. Before Timon's cave.
Shakespeare,"Enter Poet and Painter, TIMON watching them from his cave"
Shakespeare,"As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where"
Shakespeare,he abides.
Shakespeare,What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold
Shakespeare,"for true, that he's so full of gold?"
Shakespeare,"Certain: Alcibiades reports it, Phrynia and"
Shakespeare,Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor
Shakespeare,straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said
Shakespeare,he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.
Shakespeare,Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.
Shakespeare,Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens
Shakespeare,"again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore"
Shakespeare,"'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this"
Shakespeare,supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in
Shakespeare,"us, and is very likely to load our purposes with"
Shakespeare,"what they travail for, if it be a just true report"
Shakespeare,that goes of his having.
Shakespeare,What have you now to present unto him?
Shakespeare,Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will
Shakespeare,promise him an excellent piece.
Shakespeare,"I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent"
Shakespeare,that's coming toward him.
Shakespeare,Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the
Shakespeare,time: it opens the eyes of expectation:
Shakespeare,"performance is ever the duller for his act, and,"
Shakespeare,"but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the"
Shakespeare,deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is
Shakespeare,most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind
Shakespeare,of will or testament which argues a great sickness
Shakespeare,in his judgment that makes it.
Shakespeare,"TIMON comes from his cave, behind"
Shakespeare,[Aside]  Excellent workman! thou canst not paint a
Shakespeare,man so bad as is thyself.
Shakespeare,I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for
Shakespeare,"him: it must be a personating of himself, a satire"
Shakespeare,"against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery"
Shakespeare,of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.
Shakespeare,[Aside]  Must thou needs stand for a villain in
Shakespeare,thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in
Shakespeare,"other men? Do so, I have gold for thee."
Shakespeare,"Nay, let's seek him:"
Shakespeare,"Then do we sin against our own estate,"
Shakespeare,"When we may profit meet, and come too late."
Shakespeare,"When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,"
Shakespeare,Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.
Shakespeare,[Aside]  I'll meet you at the turn. What a
Shakespeare,"god's gold,"
Shakespeare,That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
Shakespeare,Than where swine feed!
Shakespeare,"'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,"
Shakespeare,Settlest admired reverence in a slave:
Shakespeare,To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye
Shakespeare,Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey!
Shakespeare,Fit I meet them.
Shakespeare,"Hail, worthy Timon!"
Shakespeare,Our late noble master!
Shakespeare,Have I once lived to see two honest men?
Shakespeare,"Having often of your open bounty tasted,"
Shakespeare,"Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off,"
Shakespeare,Whose thankless natures--O abhorred spirits!--
Shakespeare,Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:
Shakespeare,"What! to you,"
Shakespeare,Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence
Shakespeare,To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover
Shakespeare,The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
Shakespeare,With any size of words.
Shakespeare,"Let it go naked, men may see't the better:"
Shakespeare,"You that are honest, by being what you are,"
Shakespeare,Make them best seen and known.
Shakespeare,He and myself
Shakespeare,"Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,"
Shakespeare,And sweetly felt it.
Shakespeare,"Ay, you are honest men."
Shakespeare,We are hither come to offer you our service.
Shakespeare,"Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?"
Shakespeare,"Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no."
Shakespeare,"What we can do, we'll do, to do you service."
Shakespeare,"Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold,"
Shakespeare,"I am sure you have: speak truth, ye're honest men."
Shakespeare,"So it is said, my noble lord, but therefore"
Shakespeare,Came not my friend nor I.
Shakespeare,Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit
Shakespeare,"Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best,"
Shakespeare,Thou counterfeit'st most lively.
Shakespeare,"So, so, my lord."
Shakespeare,"E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,"
Shakespeare,"Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth"
Shakespeare,That thou art even natural in thine art.
Shakespeare,"But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,"
Shakespeare,I must needs say you have a little fault:
Shakespeare,"Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I"
Shakespeare,You take much pains to mend.
Shakespeare,Beseech your honour
Shakespeare,To make it known to us.
Shakespeare,You'll take it ill.
Shakespeare,"Will you, indeed?"
Shakespeare,"Doubt it not, worthy lord."
Shakespeare,"There's never a one of you but trusts a knave,"
Shakespeare,That mightily deceives you.
Shakespeare,"Do we, my lord?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,"
Shakespeare,"Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,"
Shakespeare,Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured
Shakespeare,That he's a made-up villain.
Shakespeare,"I know none such, my lord."
Shakespeare,"Look you, I love you well, I'll give you gold,"
Shakespeare,Rid me these villains from your companies:
Shakespeare,"Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,"
Shakespeare,"Confound them by some course, and come to me,"
Shakespeare,I'll give you gold enough.
Shakespeare,"Name them, my lord, let's know them."
Shakespeare,"You that way and you this, but two in company,"
Shakespeare,"Each man apart, all single and alone,"
Shakespeare,Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.
Shakespeare,"If where thou art two villains shall not be,"
Shakespeare,Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside
Shakespeare,"But where one villain is, then him abandon."
Shakespeare,"Hence, pack! there's gold, you came for gold, ye slaves:"
Shakespeare,To Painter
Shakespeare,"You have work'd for me, there's payment for you: hence!"
Shakespeare,To Poet
Shakespeare,"You are an alchemist, make gold of that."
Shakespeare,"Out, rascal dogs!"
Shakespeare,"Beats them out, and then retires to his cave"
Shakespeare,Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators
Shakespeare,"It is in vain that you would speak with Timon,"
Shakespeare,For he is set so only to himself
Shakespeare,That nothing but himself which looks like man
Shakespeare,Is friendly with him.
Shakespeare,Bring us to his cave:
Shakespeare,It is our part and promise to the Athenians
Shakespeare,To speak with Timon.
Shakespeare,At all times alike
Shakespeare,Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs
Shakespeare,"That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,"
Shakespeare,"Offering the fortunes of his former days,"
Shakespeare,"The former man may make him. Bring us to him,"
Shakespeare,And chance it as it may.
Shakespeare,Here is his cave.
Shakespeare,Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!
Shakespeare,"Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,"
Shakespeare,"By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:"
Shakespeare,"Speak to them, noble Timon."
Shakespeare,TIMON comes from his cave
Shakespeare,"Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and"
Shakespeare,be hang'd:
Shakespeare,"For each true word, a blister! and each false"
Shakespeare,"Be as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,"
Shakespeare,Consuming it with speaking!
Shakespeare,"Worthy Timon,--"
Shakespeare,"Of none but such as you, and you of Timon."
Shakespeare,"The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon."
Shakespeare,"I thank them, and would send them back the plague,"
Shakespeare,Could I but catch it for them.
Shakespeare,"O, forget"
Shakespeare,What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
Shakespeare,The senators with one consent of love
Shakespeare,"Entreat thee back to Athens, who have thought"
Shakespeare,"On special dignities, which vacant lie"
Shakespeare,For thy best use and wearing.
Shakespeare,They confess
Shakespeare,"Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross:"
Shakespeare,"Which now the public body, which doth seldom"
Shakespeare,"Play the recanter, feeling in itself"
Shakespeare,"A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal"
Shakespeare,"Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon,"
Shakespeare,"And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,"
Shakespeare,Together with a recompense more fruitful
Shakespeare,"Than their offence can weigh down by the dram,"
Shakespeare,"Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth"
Shakespeare,As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
Shakespeare,"And write in thee the figures of their love,"
Shakespeare,Ever to read them thine.
Shakespeare,"You witch me in it,"
Shakespeare,Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
Shakespeare,"Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,"
Shakespeare,"And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators."
Shakespeare,"Therefore, so please thee to return with us"
Shakespeare,"And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take"
Shakespeare,"The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,"
Shakespeare,Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name
Shakespeare,Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back
Shakespeare,"Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,"
Shakespeare,"Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up"
Shakespeare,His country's peace.
Shakespeare,And shakes his threatening sword
Shakespeare,Against the walls of Athens.
Shakespeare,"Therefore, Timon,--"
Shakespeare,"Well, sir, I will, therefore, I will, sir, thus:"
Shakespeare,"If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,"
Shakespeare,"Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,"
Shakespeare,"That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,"
Shakespeare,"And take our goodly aged men by the beards,"
Shakespeare,Giving our holy virgins to the stain
Shakespeare,"Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,"
Shakespeare,"Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,"
Shakespeare,"In pity of our aged and our youth,"
Shakespeare,"I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,"
Shakespeare,"And let him take't at worst, for their knives care not,"
Shakespeare,"While you have throats to answer: for myself,"
Shakespeare,There's not a whittle in the unruly camp
Shakespeare,But I do prize it at my love before
Shakespeare,The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
Shakespeare,"To the protection of the prosperous gods,"
Shakespeare,As thieves to keepers.
Shakespeare,"Stay not, all's in vain."
Shakespeare,"Why, I was writing of my epitaph,"
Shakespeare,it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness
Shakespeare,"Of health and living now begins to mend,"
Shakespeare,"And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still,"
Shakespeare,"Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,"
Shakespeare,And last so long enough!
Shakespeare,We speak in vain.
Shakespeare,"But yet I love my country, and am not"
Shakespeare,"One that rejoices in the common wreck,"
Shakespeare,As common bruit doth put it.
Shakespeare,That's well spoke.
Shakespeare,"Commend me to my loving countrymen,--"
Shakespeare,These words become your lips as they pass
Shakespeare,thorough them.
Shakespeare,And enter in our ears like great triumphers
Shakespeare,In their applauding gates.
Shakespeare,"Commend me to them,"
Shakespeare,"And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,"
Shakespeare,"Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,"
Shakespeare,"Their pangs of love, with other incident throes"
Shakespeare,That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
Shakespeare,"In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:"
Shakespeare,I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.
Shakespeare,"I like this well, he will return again."
Shakespeare,"I have a tree, which grows here in my close,"
Shakespeare,"That mine own use invites me to cut down,"
Shakespeare,"And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,"
Shakespeare,"Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree"
Shakespeare,"From high to low throughout, that whoso please"
Shakespeare,"To stop affliction, let him take his haste,"
Shakespeare,"Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,"
Shakespeare,"And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting."
Shakespeare,"Trouble him no further, thus you still shall find him."
Shakespeare,"Come not to me again: but say to Athens,"
Shakespeare,Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
Shakespeare,"Upon the beached verge of the salt flood,"
Shakespeare,Who once a day with his embossed froth
Shakespeare,"The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,"
Shakespeare,And let my grave-stone be your oracle.
Shakespeare,"Lips, let sour words go by and language end:"
Shakespeare,What is amiss plague and infection mend!
Shakespeare,Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
Shakespeare,"Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign."
Shakespeare,Retires to his cave
Shakespeare,His discontents are unremoveably
Shakespeare,Coupled to nature.
Shakespeare,"Our hope in him is dead: let us return,"
Shakespeare,And strain what other means is left unto us
Shakespeare,In our dear peril.
Shakespeare,It requires swift foot.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. Before the walls of Athens.
Shakespeare,Enter two Senators and a Messenger
Shakespeare,Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files
Shakespeare,As full as thy report?
Shakespeare,have spoke the least:
Shakespeare,"Besides, his expedition promises"
Shakespeare,Present approach.
Shakespeare,"We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon."
Shakespeare,"I met a courier, one mine ancient friend,"
Shakespeare,"Whom, though in general part we were opposed,"
Shakespeare,"Yet our old love made a particular force,"
Shakespeare,And made us speak like friends: this man was riding
Shakespeare,"From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,"
Shakespeare,"With letters of entreaty, which imported"
Shakespeare,"His fellowship i' the cause against your city,"
Shakespeare,In part for his sake moved.
Shakespeare,Here come our brothers.
Shakespeare,Enter the Senators from TIMON
Shakespeare,"No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect."
Shakespeare,"The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring"
Shakespeare,"Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:"
Shakespeare,"Ours is the fall, I fear, our foes the snare."
Shakespeare,"SCENE III. The woods. Timon's cave, and a rude tomb seen."
Shakespeare,"Enter a Soldier, seeking TIMON"
Shakespeare,By all description this should be the place.
Shakespeare,"Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?"
Shakespeare,"Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:"
Shakespeare,"Some beast rear'd this, there does not live a man."
Shakespeare,"Dead, sure, and this his grave. What's on this tomb"
Shakespeare,"I cannot read, the character I'll take with wax:"
Shakespeare,"Our captain hath in every figure skill,"
Shakespeare,"An aged interpreter, though young in days:"
Shakespeare,"Before proud Athens he's set down by this,"
Shakespeare,Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.
Shakespeare,SCENE IV. Before the walls of Athens.
Shakespeare,Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers
Shakespeare,Sound to this coward and lascivious town
Shakespeare,Our terrible approach.
Shakespeare,Enter Senators on the walls
Shakespeare,Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time
Shakespeare,"With all licentious measure, making your wills"
Shakespeare,"The scope of justice, till now myself and such"
Shakespeare,As slept within the shadow of your power
Shakespeare,Hav e wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed
Shakespeare,"Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,"
Shakespeare,When crouching marrow in the bearer strong
Shakespeare,Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong
Shakespeare,"Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,"
Shakespeare,And pursy insolence shall break his wind
Shakespeare,With fear and horrid flight.
Shakespeare,"Noble and young,"
Shakespeare,"When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,"
Shakespeare,"Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,"
Shakespeare,"We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,"
Shakespeare,To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
Shakespeare,Above their quantity.
Shakespeare,So did we woo
Shakespeare,Transformed Timon to our city's love
Shakespeare,By humble message and by promised means:
Shakespeare,"We were not all unkind, nor all deserve"
Shakespeare,The common stroke of war.
Shakespeare,These walls of ours
Shakespeare,Were not erected by their hands from whom
Shakespeare,"You have received your griefs, nor are they such"
Shakespeare,"That these great towers, trophies and schools"
Shakespeare,should fall
Shakespeare,For private faults in them.
Shakespeare,Nor are they living
Shakespeare,"Who were the motives that you first went out,"
Shakespeare,"Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess"
Shakespeare,"Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,"
Shakespeare,Into our city with thy banners spread:
Shakespeare,"By decimation, and a tithed death--"
Shakespeare,If thy revenges hunger for that food
Shakespeare,"Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth,"
Shakespeare,And by the hazard of the spotted die
Shakespeare,Let die the spotted.
Shakespeare,"All have not offended,"
Shakespeare,"For those that were, it is not square to take"
Shakespeare,"On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,"
Shakespeare,"Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,"
Shakespeare,"Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:"
Shakespeare,Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
Shakespeare,Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
Shakespeare,"With those that have offended: like a shepherd,"
Shakespeare,"Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,"
Shakespeare,But kill not all together.
Shakespeare,"What thou wilt,"
Shakespeare,Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
Shakespeare,Than hew to't with thy sword.
Shakespeare,Set but thy foot
Shakespeare,"Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope,"
Shakespeare,"So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,"
Shakespeare,To say thou'lt enter friendly.
Shakespeare,"Throw thy glove,"
Shakespeare,"Or any token of thine honour else,"
Shakespeare,That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
Shakespeare,"And not as our confusion, all thy powers"
Shakespeare,"Shall make their harbour in our town, till we"
Shakespeare,Have seal'd thy full desire.
Shakespeare,"Then there's my glove,"
Shakespeare,"Descend, and open your uncharged ports:"
Shakespeare,Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
Shakespeare,Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
Shakespeare,"Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears"
Shakespeare,"With my more noble meaning, not a man"
Shakespeare,"Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream"
Shakespeare,"Of regular justice in your city's bounds,"
Shakespeare,But shall be render'd to your public laws
Shakespeare,At heaviest answer.
Shakespeare,'Tis most nobly spoken.
Shakespeare,"Descend, and keep your words."
Shakespeare,"The Senators descend, and open the gates"
Shakespeare,Enter Soldier
Shakespeare,"My noble general, Timon is dead,"
Shakespeare,"Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea,"
Shakespeare,"And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which"
Shakespeare,"With wax I brought away, whose soft impression"
Shakespeare,Interprets for my poor ignorance.
Shakespeare,[Reads the epitaph]  'Here lies a
Shakespeare,"wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:"
Shakespeare,Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked
Shakespeare,caitiffs left!
Shakespeare,"Here lie I, Timon, who, alive, all living men did hate:"
Shakespeare,"Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay"
Shakespeare,not here thy gait.'
Shakespeare,These well express in thee thy latter spirits:
Shakespeare,"Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,"
Shakespeare,Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our
Shakespeare,droplets which
Shakespeare,"From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit"
Shakespeare,Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
Shakespeare,"On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead"
Shakespeare,Is noble Timon: of whose memory
Shakespeare,"Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,"
Shakespeare,"And I will use the olive with my sword,"
Shakespeare,"Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each"
Shakespeare,Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
Shakespeare,Let our drums strike.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol.
Shakespeare,"The Tomb of the ANDRONICI appearing, the Tribunes  and Senators aloft. Enter, below, from one side,  SATURNINUS and his Followers, and, from the other side, BASSIANUS and his Followers, with drum and colours"
Shakespeare,"Noble patricians, patrons of my right,"
Shakespeare,"Defend the justice of my cause with arms,"
Shakespeare,"And, countrymen, my loving followers,"
Shakespeare,Plead my successive title with your swords:
Shakespeare,"I am his first-born son, that was the last"
Shakespeare,"That wore the imperial diadem of Rome,"
Shakespeare,"Then let my father's honours live in me,"
Shakespeare,Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
Shakespeare,"Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,"
Shakespeare,"If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,"
Shakespeare,"Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,"
Shakespeare,Keep then this passage to the Capitol
Shakespeare,And suffer not dishonour to approach
Shakespeare,"The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,"
Shakespeare,"To justice, continence and nobility,"
Shakespeare,"But let desert in pure election shine,"
Shakespeare,"And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice."
Shakespeare,"Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS, aloft, with the crown"
Shakespeare,"Princes, that strive by factions and by friends"
Shakespeare,"Ambitiously for rule and empery,"
Shakespeare,"Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand"
Shakespeare,"A special party, have, by common voice,"
Shakespeare,"In election for the Roman empery,"
Shakespeare,"Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius"
Shakespeare,For many good and great deserts to Rome:
Shakespeare,"A nobler man, a braver warrior,"
Shakespeare,Lives not this day within the city walls:
Shakespeare,He by the senate is accit'd home
Shakespeare,"From weary wars against the barbarous Goths,"
Shakespeare,"That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,"
Shakespeare,"Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms."
Shakespeare,Ten years are spent since first he undertook
Shakespeare,This cause of Rome and chastised with arms
Shakespeare,Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd
Shakespeare,"Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons"
Shakespeare,"In coffins from the field,"
Shakespeare,"And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,"
Shakespeare,"Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,"
Shakespeare,"Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms."
Shakespeare,"Let us entreat, by honour of his name,"
Shakespeare,Whom worthily you would have now succeed.
Shakespeare,"And in the Capitol and senate's right,"
Shakespeare,"Whom you pretend to honour and adore,"
Shakespeare,"That you withdraw you and abate your strength,"
Shakespeare,"Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,"
Shakespeare,Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.
Shakespeare,How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!
Shakespeare,"Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally"
Shakespeare,"In thy uprightness and integrity,"
Shakespeare,"And so I love and honour thee and thine,"
Shakespeare,"Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,"
Shakespeare,"And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,"
Shakespeare,"Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,"
Shakespeare,"That I will here dismiss my loving friends,"
Shakespeare,And to my fortunes and the people's favor
Shakespeare,Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.
Shakespeare,Exeunt the followers of BASSIANUS
Shakespeare,"Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,"
Shakespeare,"I thank you all and here dismiss you all,"
Shakespeare,And to the love and favor of my country
Shakespeare,"Commit myself, my person and the cause."
Shakespeare,Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS
Shakespeare,"Rome, be as just and gracious unto me"
Shakespeare,As I am confident and kind to thee.
Shakespeare,"Open the gates, and let me in."
Shakespeare,"Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor."
Shakespeare,Flourish. SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS go up into the Capitol
Shakespeare,"Romans, make way: the good Andronicus."
Shakespeare,"Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,"
Shakespeare,"Successful in the battles that he fights,"
Shakespeare,With honour and with fortune is return'd
Shakespeare,"From where he circumscribed with his sword,"
Shakespeare,"And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome."
Shakespeare,"Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and  MUTIUS, After them, two Men bearing a coffin  covered with black, then LUCIUS and QUINTUS. After  them, TITUS ANDRONICUS, and then TAMORA, with  ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, AARON, and other Goths,  prisoners, Soldiers and people following. The Bearers set down the coffin, and TITUS speaks"
Shakespeare,"Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!"
Shakespeare,"Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,"
Shakespeare,Returns with precious jading to the bay
Shakespeare,"From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,"
Shakespeare,"Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,"
Shakespeare,"To re-salute his country with his tears,"
Shakespeare,Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
Shakespeare,"Thou great defender of this Capitol,"
Shakespeare,Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
Shakespeare,"Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,"
Shakespeare,"Half of the number that King Priam had,"
Shakespeare,"Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!"
Shakespeare,"These that survive let Rome reward with love,"
Shakespeare,"These that I bring unto their latest home,"
Shakespeare,With burial amongst their ancestors:
Shakespeare,Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
Shakespeare,"Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,"
Shakespeare,"Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,"
Shakespeare,To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
Shakespeare,Make way to lay them by their brethren.
Shakespeare,The tomb is opened
Shakespeare,"There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,"
Shakespeare,"And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!"
Shakespeare,"O sacred receptacle of my joys,"
Shakespeare,"Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,"
Shakespeare,"How many sons of mine hast thou in store,"
Shakespeare,That thou wilt never render to me more!
Shakespeare,"Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,"
Shakespeare,"That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile"
Shakespeare,"Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,"
Shakespeare,"Before this earthy prison of their bones,"
Shakespeare,"That so the shadows be not unappeased,"
Shakespeare,Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
Shakespeare,"I give him you, the noblest that survives,"
Shakespeare,The eldest son of this distressed queen.
Shakespeare,"Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,"
Shakespeare,"Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,"
Shakespeare,A mother's tears in passion for her son:
Shakespeare,"And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,"
Shakespeare,"O, think my son to be as dear to me!"
Shakespeare,"Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,"
Shakespeare,"To beautify thy triumphs and return,"
Shakespeare,"Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,"
Shakespeare,"But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,"
Shakespeare,For valiant doings in their country's cause?
Shakespeare,"O, if to fight for king and commonweal"
Shakespeare,"Were piety in thine, it is in these."
Shakespeare,"Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:"
Shakespeare,Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
Shakespeare,Draw near them then in being merciful:
Shakespeare,Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:
Shakespeare,"Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son."
Shakespeare,"Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me."
Shakespeare,"These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld"
Shakespeare,"Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain"
Shakespeare,Religiously they ask a sacrifice:
Shakespeare,"To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,"
Shakespeare,To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.
Shakespeare,"Away with him! and make a fire straight,"
Shakespeare,"And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,"
Shakespeare,Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS, and MUTIUS, with ALARBUS"
Shakespeare,"O cruel, irreligious piety!"
Shakespeare,Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?
Shakespeare,Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
Shakespeare,"Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive"
Shakespeare,To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.
Shakespeare,"Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal"
Shakespeare,The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
Shakespeare,With opportunity of sharp revenge
Shakespeare,"Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,"
Shakespeare,"May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths--"
Shakespeare,When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen--
Shakespeare,To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS and MUTIUS, with their swords bloody"
Shakespeare,"See, lord and father, how we have perform'd"
Shakespeare,"Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,"
Shakespeare,"And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,"
Shakespeare,"Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky."
Shakespeare,"Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,"
Shakespeare,And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
Shakespeare,"Let it be so, and let Andronicus"
Shakespeare,Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
Shakespeare,"Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb"
Shakespeare,"In peace and honour rest you here, my sons,"
Shakespeare,"Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,"
Shakespeare,Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
Shakespeare,"Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,"
Shakespeare,"Here grow no damned grudges, here are no storms,"
Shakespeare,"No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:"
Shakespeare,"In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!"
Shakespeare,Enter LAVINIA
Shakespeare,"In peace and honour live Lord Titus long,"
Shakespeare,"My noble lord and father, live in fame!"
Shakespeare,"Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears"
Shakespeare,"I render, for my brethren's obsequies,"
Shakespeare,"And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy,"
Shakespeare,"Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:"
Shakespeare,"O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,"
Shakespeare,Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!
Shakespeare,"Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved"
Shakespeare,The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
Shakespeare,"Lavinia, live, outlive thy father's days,"
Shakespeare,"And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!"
Shakespeare,"Enter, below, MARCUS ANDRONICUS and Tribunes, re-enter SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS, attended"
Shakespeare,"Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,"
Shakespeare,Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!
Shakespeare,"Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus."
Shakespeare,"And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,"
Shakespeare,"You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!"
Shakespeare,"Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,"
Shakespeare,That in your country's service drew your swords:
Shakespeare,"But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,"
Shakespeare,That hath aspired to Solon's happiness
Shakespeare,And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
Shakespeare,"Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,"
Shakespeare,"Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,"
Shakespeare,"Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,"
Shakespeare,"This palliament of white and spotless hue,"
Shakespeare,"And name thee in election for the empire,"
Shakespeare,With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:
Shakespeare,"Be candidatus then, and put it on,"
Shakespeare,And help to set a head on headless Rome.
Shakespeare,A better head her glorious body fits
Shakespeare,Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:
Shakespeare,"What should I don this robe, and trouble you?"
Shakespeare,"Be chosen with proclamations to-day,"
Shakespeare,"To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,"
Shakespeare,And set abroad new business for you all?
Shakespeare,"Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,"
Shakespeare,"And led my country's strength successfully,"
Shakespeare,"And buried one and twenty valiant sons,"
Shakespeare,"Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,"
Shakespeare,In right and service of their noble country
Shakespeare,"Give me a staff of honour for mine age,"
Shakespeare,But not a sceptre to control the world:
Shakespeare,"Upright he held it, lords, that held it last."
Shakespeare,"Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery."
Shakespeare,"Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?"
Shakespeare,"Patience, Prince Saturninus."
Shakespeare,"Romans, do me right:"
Shakespeare,"Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not"
Shakespeare,Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.
Shakespeare,"Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell,"
Shakespeare,Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
Shakespeare,"Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good"
Shakespeare,That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
Shakespeare,"Content thee, prince, I will restore to thee"
Shakespeare,"The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves."
Shakespeare,"Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,"
Shakespeare,"But honour thee, and will do till I die:"
Shakespeare,"My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,"
Shakespeare,"I will most thankful be, and thanks to men"
Shakespeare,Of noble minds is honourable meed.
Shakespeare,"People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,"
Shakespeare,I ask your voices and your suffrages:
Shakespeare,Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
Shakespeare,"To gratify the good Andronicus,"
Shakespeare,"And gratulate his safe return to Rome,"
Shakespeare,The people will accept whom he admits.
Shakespeare,"Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make,"
Shakespeare,"That you create your emperor's eldest son,"
Shakespeare,"Lord Saturnine, whose virtues will, I hope,"
Shakespeare,"Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,"
Shakespeare,And ripen justice in this commonweal:
Shakespeare,"Then, if you will elect by my advice,"
Shakespeare,Crown him and say 'Long live our emperor!'
Shakespeare,"With voices and applause of every sort,"
Shakespeare,"Patricians and plebeians, we create"
Shakespeare,"Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,"
Shakespeare,And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'
Shakespeare,A long flourish till they come down
Shakespeare,"Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done"
Shakespeare,"To us in our election this day,"
Shakespeare,"I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,"
Shakespeare,And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:
Shakespeare,"And, for an onset, Titus, to advance"
Shakespeare,"Thy name and honourable family,"
Shakespeare,"Lavinia will I make my empress,"
Shakespeare,"Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,"
Shakespeare,And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse:
Shakespeare,"Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?"
Shakespeare,"It doth, my worthy lord, and in this match"
Shakespeare,I hold me highly honour'd of your grace:
Shakespeare,"And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,"
Shakespeare,"King and commander of our commonweal,"
Shakespeare,"The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate"
Shakespeare,"My sword, my chariot and my prisoners,"
Shakespeare,Presents well worthy Rome's imperial lord:
Shakespeare,"Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,"
Shakespeare,Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.
Shakespeare,"Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!"
Shakespeare,How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
Shakespeare,"Rome shall record, and when I do forget"
Shakespeare,"The least of these unspeakable deserts,"
Shakespeare,"Romans, forget your fealty to me."
Shakespeare,"[To TAMORA]  Now, madam, are you prisoner to"
Shakespeare,"an emperor,"
Shakespeare,"To him that, for your honour and your state,"
Shakespeare,Will use you nobly and your followers.
Shakespeare,"A goodly lady, trust me, of the hue"
Shakespeare,"That I would choose, were I to choose anew."
Shakespeare,"Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:"
Shakespeare,"Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,"
Shakespeare,Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome:
Shakespeare,Princely shall be thy usage every way.
Shakespeare,"Rest on my word, and let not discontent"
Shakespeare,"Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you"
Shakespeare,Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
Shakespeare,"Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?"
Shakespeare,"Not I, my lord, sith true nobility"
Shakespeare,Warrants these words in princely courtesy.
Shakespeare,"Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go,"
Shakespeare,Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:
Shakespeare,"Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum."
Shakespeare,Flourish. SATURNINUS courts TAMORA in dumb show
Shakespeare,"Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine."
Shakespeare,Seizing LAVINIA
Shakespeare,"How, sir! are you in earnest then, my lord?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, noble Titus, and resolved withal"
Shakespeare,To do myself this reason and this right.
Shakespeare,'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:
Shakespeare,This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
Shakespeare,"And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live."
Shakespeare,"Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?"
Shakespeare,"Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!"
Shakespeare,Surprised! by whom?
Shakespeare,By him that justly may
Shakespeare,Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.
Shakespeare,Exeunt BASSIANUS and MARCUS with LAVINIA
Shakespeare,"Brothers, help to convey her hence away,"
Shakespeare,And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS"
Shakespeare,"Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back."
Shakespeare,"My lord, you pass not here."
Shakespeare,"What, villain boy!"
Shakespeare,Barr'st me my way in Rome?
Shakespeare,Stabbing MUTIUS
Shakespeare,"Help, Lucius, help!"
Shakespeare,"During the fray, SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON and AARON go out and re-enter, above"
Shakespeare,"My lord, you are unjust, and, more than so,"
Shakespeare,In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
Shakespeare,"Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine,"
Shakespeare,My sons would never so dishonour me:
Shakespeare,"Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor."
Shakespeare,"Dead, if you will, but not to be his wife,"
Shakespeare,That is another's lawful promised love.
Shakespeare,"No, Titus, no, the emperor needs her not,"
Shakespeare,"Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:"
Shakespeare,"I'll trust, by leisure, him that mocks me once,"
Shakespeare,"Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,"
Shakespeare,Confederates all thus to dishonour me.
Shakespeare,"Was there none else in Rome to make a stale,"
Shakespeare,"But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,"
Shakespeare,"Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine,"
Shakespeare,That said'st I begg'd the empire at thy hands.
Shakespeare,O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?
Shakespeare,"But go thy ways, go, give that changing piece"
Shakespeare,To him that flourish'd for her with his sword
Shakespeare,"A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy,"
Shakespeare,"One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,"
Shakespeare,To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.
Shakespeare,These words are razors to my wounded heart.
Shakespeare,"And therefore, lovely Tamora, queen of Goths,"
Shakespeare,That like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs
Shakespeare,"Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,"
Shakespeare,"If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,"
Shakespeare,"Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,"
Shakespeare,"And will create thee empress of Rome,"
Shakespeare,"Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?"
Shakespeare,"And here I swear by all the Roman gods,"
Shakespeare,Sith priest and holy water are so near
Shakespeare,And tapers burn so bright and every thing
Shakespeare,"In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,"
Shakespeare,"I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,"
Shakespeare,"Or climb my palace, till from forth this place"
Shakespeare,I lead espoused my bride along with me.
Shakespeare,"And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear,"
Shakespeare,"If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,"
Shakespeare,"She will a handmaid be to his desires,"
Shakespeare,"A loving nurse, a mother to his youth."
Shakespeare,"Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany"
Shakespeare,"Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,"
Shakespeare,"Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,"
Shakespeare,Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:
Shakespeare,There shall we consummate our spousal rites.
Shakespeare,Exeunt all but TITUS
Shakespeare,I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
Shakespeare,"Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,"
Shakespeare,"Dishonour'd thus, and challenged of wrongs?"
Shakespeare,"Re-enter MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS"
Shakespeare,"O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!"
Shakespeare,In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
Shakespeare,"No, foolish tribune, no, no son of mine,"
Shakespeare,"Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed"
Shakespeare,"That hath dishonour'd all our family,"
Shakespeare,"Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!"
Shakespeare,"But let us give him burial, as becomes,"
Shakespeare,Give Mutius burial with our brethren.
Shakespeare,"Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb:"
Shakespeare,"This monument five hundred years hath stood,"
Shakespeare,Which I have sumptuously re-edified:
Shakespeare,Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
Shakespeare,"Repose in fame, none basely slain in brawls:"
Shakespeare,"Bury him where you can, he comes not here."
Shakespeare,"My lord, this is impiety in you:"
Shakespeare,My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him
Shakespeare,He must be buried with his brethren.
Shakespeare,"And shall, or him we will accompany."
Shakespeare,'And shall!' what villain was it that spake
Shakespeare,that word?
Shakespeare,He that would vouch it in any place but here.
Shakespeare,"What, would you bury him in my despite?"
Shakespeare,"No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee"
Shakespeare,To pardon Mutius and to bury him.
Shakespeare,"Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,"
Shakespeare,"And, with these boys, mine honour thou hast wounded:"
Shakespeare,"My foes I do repute you every one,"
Shakespeare,"So, trouble me no more, but get you gone."
Shakespeare,"He is not with himself, let us withdraw."
Shakespeare,"Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried."
Shakespeare,MARCUS and the Sons of TITUS kneel
Shakespeare,"Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,--"
Shakespeare,"Father, and in that name doth nature speak,--"
Shakespeare,"Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed."
Shakespeare,"Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,--"
Shakespeare,"Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--"
Shakespeare,Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
Shakespeare,"His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,"
Shakespeare,That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.
Shakespeare,"Thou art a Roman, be not barbarous:"
Shakespeare,The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax
Shakespeare,"That slew himself, and wise Laertes' son"
Shakespeare,Did graciously plead for his funerals:
Shakespeare,"Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy"
Shakespeare,Be barr'd his entrance here.
Shakespeare,"Rise, Marcus, rise."
Shakespeare,"The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,"
Shakespeare,To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome!
Shakespeare,"Well, bury him, and bury me the next."
Shakespeare,MUTIUS is put into the tomb
Shakespeare,"There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,"
Shakespeare,Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
Shakespeare,"[Kneeling]  No man shed tears for noble Mutius,"
Shakespeare,He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
Shakespeare,"My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,"
Shakespeare,How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
Shakespeare,Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?
Shakespeare,"I know not, Marcus, but I know it is,"
Shakespeare,"Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell:"
Shakespeare,Is she not then beholding to the man
Shakespeare,That brought her for this high good turn so far?
Shakespeare,"Yes, and will nobly him remunerate."
Shakespeare,"Flourish. Re-enter, from one side, SATURNINUS  attended, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON and AARON, from the other, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, and others"
Shakespeare,"So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:"
Shakespeare,"God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!"
Shakespeare,"And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,"
Shakespeare,"Nor wish no less, and so, I take my leave."
Shakespeare,"Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,"
Shakespeare,Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
Shakespeare,"Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,"
Shakespeare,My truth-betrothed love and now my wife?
Shakespeare,"But let the laws of Rome determine all,"
Shakespeare,Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.
Shakespeare,"'Tis good, sir: you are very short with us,"
Shakespeare,"But, if we live, we'll be as sharp with you."
Shakespeare,"My lord, what I have done, as best I may,"
Shakespeare,Answer I must and shall do with my life.
Shakespeare,Only thus much I give your grace to know:
Shakespeare,"By all the duties that I owe to Rome,"
Shakespeare,"This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,"
Shakespeare,"Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd,"
Shakespeare,That in the rescue of Lavinia
Shakespeare,"With his own hand did slay his youngest son,"
Shakespeare,In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath
Shakespeare,To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:
Shakespeare,"Receive him, then, to favor, Saturnine,"
Shakespeare,That hath express'd himself in all his deeds
Shakespeare,A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
Shakespeare,"Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:"
Shakespeare,'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me.
Shakespeare,"Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,"
Shakespeare,How I have loved and honour'd Saturnine!
Shakespeare,"My worthy lord, if ever Tamora"
Shakespeare,"Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,"
Shakespeare,"Then hear me speak in indifferently for all,"
Shakespeare,"And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past."
Shakespeare,"What, madam! be dishonour'd openly,"
Shakespeare,And basely put it up without revenge?
Shakespeare,"Not so, my lord, the gods of Rome forfend"
Shakespeare,I should be author to dishonour you!
Shakespeare,But on mine honour dare I undertake
Shakespeare,"For good Lord Titus' innocence in all,"
Shakespeare,Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs:
Shakespeare,"Then, at my suit, look graciously on him,"
Shakespeare,"Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,"
Shakespeare,Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.
Shakespeare,Aside to SATURNINUS
Shakespeare,"be won at last,"
Shakespeare,Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:
Shakespeare,"You are but newly planted in your throne,"
Shakespeare,"Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,"
Shakespeare,"Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,"
Shakespeare,"And so supplant you for ingratitude,"
Shakespeare,"Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,"
Shakespeare,"Yield at entreats, and then let me alone:"
Shakespeare,I'll find a day to massacre them all
Shakespeare,"And raze their faction and their family,"
Shakespeare,"The cruel father and his traitorous sons,"
Shakespeare,"To whom I sued for my dear son's life,"
Shakespeare,And make them know what 'tis to let a queen
Shakespeare,Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.
Shakespeare,"Come, come, sweet emperor, come, Andronicus,"
Shakespeare,"Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart"
Shakespeare,That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.
Shakespeare,"Rise, Titus, rise, my empress hath prevail'd."
Shakespeare,"I thank your majesty, and her, my lord:"
Shakespeare,"These words, these looks, infuse new life in me."
Shakespeare,"Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,"
Shakespeare,"A Roman now adopted happily,"
Shakespeare,And must advise the emperor for his good.
Shakespeare,"This day all quarrels die, Andronicus,"
Shakespeare,"And let it be mine honour, good my lord,"
Shakespeare,That I have reconciled your friends and you.
Shakespeare,"For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd"
Shakespeare,"My word and promise to the emperor,"
Shakespeare,That you will be more mild and tractable.
Shakespeare,"And fear not lords, and you, Lavinia,"
Shakespeare,"By my advice, all humbled on your knees,"
Shakespeare,You shall ask pardon of his majesty.
Shakespeare,"We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness,"
Shakespeare,"That what we did was mildly as we might,"
Shakespeare,Tendering our sister's honour and our own.
Shakespeare,"That, on mine honour, here I do protest."
Shakespeare,"Away, and talk not, trouble us no more."
Shakespeare,"Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:"
Shakespeare,"The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace,"
Shakespeare,"I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back."
Shakespeare,"Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here,"
Shakespeare,"And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,"
Shakespeare,I do remit these young men's heinous faults: Stand up.
Shakespeare,"Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,"
Shakespeare,"I found a friend, and sure as death I swore"
Shakespeare,I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
Shakespeare,"Come, if the emperor's court can feast two brides,"
Shakespeare,"You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends."
Shakespeare,"This day shall be a love-day, Tamora."
Shakespeare,"To-morrow, an it please your majesty"
Shakespeare,"To hunt the panther and the hart with me,"
Shakespeare,With horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour.
Shakespeare,"Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Rome. Before the Palace.
Shakespeare,Enter AARON
Shakespeare,Enter AARON
Shakespeare,"Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,"
Shakespeare,"Safe out of fortune's shot, and sits aloft,"
Shakespeare,"Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash,"
Shakespeare,Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.
Shakespeare,"As when the golden sun salutes the morn,"
Shakespeare,"And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,"
Shakespeare,"Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,"
Shakespeare,"And overlooks the highest-peering hills,"
Shakespeare,So Tamora:
Shakespeare,"Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,"
Shakespeare,And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
Shakespeare,"Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,"
Shakespeare,"To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,"
Shakespeare,"And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long"
Shakespeare,"Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains"
Shakespeare,And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
Shakespeare,Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
Shakespeare,Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
Shakespeare,"I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,"
Shakespeare,To wait upon this new-made empress.
Shakespeare,"To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,"
Shakespeare,"This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,"
Shakespeare,"This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,"
Shakespeare,And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
Shakespeare,Holloa! what storm is this?
Shakespeare,"Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, braving"
Shakespeare,"Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,"
Shakespeare,"And manners, to intrude where I am graced,"
Shakespeare,"And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be."
Shakespeare,"Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all,"
Shakespeare,"And so in this, to bear me down with braves."
Shakespeare,'Tis not the difference of a year or two
Shakespeare,Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:
Shakespeare,I am as able and as fit as thou
Shakespeare,"To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace,"
Shakespeare,"And that my sword upon thee shall approve,"
Shakespeare,And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep"
Shakespeare,the peace.
Shakespeare,"Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,"
Shakespeare,"Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,"
Shakespeare,"Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?"
Shakespeare,"Go to, have your lath glued within your sheath"
Shakespeare,Till you know better how to handle it.
Shakespeare,"Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,"
Shakespeare,Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
Shakespeare,"Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?"
Shakespeare,"[Coming forward]  Why, how now, lords!"
Shakespeare,"So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,"
Shakespeare,And maintain such a quarrel openly?
Shakespeare,Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
Shakespeare,I would not for a million of gold
Shakespeare,"The cause were known to them it most concerns,"
Shakespeare,Nor would your noble mother for much more
Shakespeare,Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.
Shakespeare,"For shame, put up."
Shakespeare,"Not I, till I have sheathed"
Shakespeare,My rapier in his bosom and withal
Shakespeare,Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat
Shakespeare,That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.
Shakespeare,For that I am prepared and full resolved.
Shakespeare,"Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,"
Shakespeare,And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!
Shakespeare,"Away, I say!"
Shakespeare,"Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,"
Shakespeare,This petty brabble will undo us all.
Shakespeare,"Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous"
Shakespeare,It is to jet upon a prince's right?
Shakespeare,"What, is Lavinia then become so loose,"
Shakespeare,"Or Bassianus so degenerate,"
Shakespeare,That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
Shakespeare,"Without controlment, justice, or revenge?"
Shakespeare,"Young lords, beware! and should the empress know"
Shakespeare,"This discord's ground, the music would not please."
Shakespeare,"I care not, I, knew she and all the world:"
Shakespeare,I love Lavinia more than all the world.
Shakespeare,"Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:"
Shakespeare,Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.
Shakespeare,"Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome"
Shakespeare,"How furious and impatient they be,"
Shakespeare,And cannot brook competitors in love?
Shakespeare,"I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths"
Shakespeare,By this device.
Shakespeare,"Aaron, a thousand deaths"
Shakespeare,Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
Shakespeare,To achieve her! how?
Shakespeare,Why makest thou it so strange?
Shakespeare,"She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd,"
Shakespeare,"She is a woman, therefore may be won,"
Shakespeare,"She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved."
Shakespeare,"What, man! more water glideth by the mill"
Shakespeare,"Than wots the miller of, and easy it is"
Shakespeare,"Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:"
Shakespeare,Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.
Shakespeare,Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  Ay, and as good as Saturninus may."
Shakespeare,Then why should he despair that knows to court it
Shakespeare,"With words, fair looks and liberality?"
Shakespeare,"What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,"
Shakespeare,And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
Shakespeare,"Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so"
Shakespeare,Would serve your turns.
Shakespeare,"Ay, so the turn were served."
Shakespeare,"Aaron, thou hast hit it."
Shakespeare,Would you had hit it too!
Shakespeare,Then should not we be tired with this ado.
Shakespeare,"Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools"
Shakespeare,"To square for this? would it offend you, then"
Shakespeare,That both should speed?
Shakespeare,"Faith, not me."
Shakespeare,"Nor me, so I were one."
Shakespeare,"For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:"
Shakespeare,'Tis policy and stratagem must do
Shakespeare,"That you affect, and so must you resolve,"
Shakespeare,"That what you cannot as you would achieve,"
Shakespeare,You must perforce accomplish as you may.
Shakespeare,Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
Shakespeare,"Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love."
Shakespeare,A speedier course than lingering languishment
Shakespeare,"Must we pursue, and I have found the path."
Shakespeare,"My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand,"
Shakespeare,There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
Shakespeare,"The forest walks are wide and spacious,"
Shakespeare,And many unfrequented plots there are
Shakespeare,Fitted by kind for rape and villany:
Shakespeare,"Single you thither then this dainty doe,"
Shakespeare,"And strike her home by force, if not by words:"
Shakespeare,"This way, or not at all, stand you in hope."
Shakespeare,"Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit"
Shakespeare,"To villany and vengeance consecrate,"
Shakespeare,"Will we acquaint with all that we intend,"
Shakespeare,"And she shall file our engines with advice,"
Shakespeare,"That will not suffer you to square yourselves,"
Shakespeare,But to your wishes' height advance you both.
Shakespeare,"The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,"
Shakespeare,"The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:"
Shakespeare,"The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull,"
Shakespeare,"There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take"
Shakespeare,"your turns,"
Shakespeare,"There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,"
Shakespeare,And revel in Lavinia's treasury.
Shakespeare,"Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,"
Shakespeare,"Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream"
Shakespeare,"To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits."
Shakespeare,"Per Styga, per manes vehor."
Shakespeare,SCENE II. A forest near Rome. Horns and cry of hounds heard.
Shakespeare,"Enter TITUS ANDRONICUS, with Hunters,  and c., MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS"
Shakespeare,"The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,"
Shakespeare,The fields are fragrant and the woods are green:
Shakespeare,Uncouple here and let us make a bay
Shakespeare,And wake the emperor and his lovely bride
Shakespeare,"And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,"
Shakespeare,That all the court may echo with the noise.
Shakespeare,"Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,"
Shakespeare,To attend the emperor's person carefully:
Shakespeare,"I have been troubled in my sleep this night,"
Shakespeare,But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.
Shakespeare,"A cry of hounds and horns, winded in a peal. Enter  SATURNINUS, TAMORA, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, and Attendants"
Shakespeare,"Many good morrows to your majesty,"
Shakespeare,"Madam, to you as many and as good:"
Shakespeare,I promised your grace a hunter's peal.
Shakespeare,"And you have rung it lustily, my lord,"
Shakespeare,Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.
Shakespeare,"Lavinia, how say you?"
Shakespeare,"I say, no,"
Shakespeare,I have been broad awake two hours and more.
Shakespeare,"Come on, then, horse and chariots let us have,"
Shakespeare,And to our sport.
Shakespeare,To TAMORA
Shakespeare,"Madam, now shall ye see"
Shakespeare,Our Roman hunting.
Shakespeare,"I have dogs, my lord,"
Shakespeare,"Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,"
Shakespeare,And climb the highest promontory top.
Shakespeare,And I have horse will follow where the game
Shakespeare,"Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain."
Shakespeare,"Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,"
Shakespeare,But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.
Shakespeare,SCENE III. A lonely part of the forest.
Shakespeare,"Enter AARON, with a bag of gold"
Shakespeare,"He that had wit would think that I had none,"
Shakespeare,"To bury so much gold under a tree,"
Shakespeare,And never after to inherit it.
Shakespeare,Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
Shakespeare,"Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,"
Shakespeare,"Which, cunningly effected, will beget"
Shakespeare,A very excellent piece of villany:
Shakespeare,"And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest"
Shakespeare,Hides the gold
Shakespeare,That have their alms out of the empress' chest.
Shakespeare,Enter TAMORA
Shakespeare,"My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,"
Shakespeare,When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?
Shakespeare,"The birds chant melody on every bush,"
Shakespeare,"The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,"
Shakespeare,The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
Shakespeare,And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:
Shakespeare,"Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,"
Shakespeare,"And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,"
Shakespeare,"Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,"
Shakespeare,"As if a double hunt were heard at once,"
Shakespeare,"Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise,"
Shakespeare,"And, after conflict such as was supposed"
Shakespeare,"The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,"
Shakespeare,When with a happy storm they were surprised
Shakespeare,"And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,"
Shakespeare,"We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,"
Shakespeare,"Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber,"
Shakespeare,Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
Shakespeare,Be unto us as is a nurse's song
Shakespeare,Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
Shakespeare,"Madam, though Venus govern your desires,"
Shakespeare,Saturn is dominator over mine:
Shakespeare,"What signifies my deadly-standing eye,"
Shakespeare,"My silence and my cloudy melancholy,"
Shakespeare,My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
Shakespeare,Even as an adder when she doth unroll
Shakespeare,To do some fatal execution?
Shakespeare,"No, madam, these are no venereal signs:"
Shakespeare,"Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,"
Shakespeare,Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
Shakespeare,"Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,"
Shakespeare,"Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,"
Shakespeare,This is the day of doom for Bassianus:
Shakespeare,"His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,"
Shakespeare,Thy sons make pillage of her chastity
Shakespeare,And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
Shakespeare,"Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,"
Shakespeare,And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.
Shakespeare,"Now question me no more, we are espied,"
Shakespeare,"Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,"
Shakespeare,Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.
Shakespeare,"Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!"
Shakespeare,"No more, great empress, Bassianus comes:"
Shakespeare,"Be cross with him, and I'll go fetch thy sons"
Shakespeare,"To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be."
Shakespeare,Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA
Shakespeare,"Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,"
Shakespeare,Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
Shakespeare,"Or is it Dian, habited like her,"
Shakespeare,Who hath abandoned her holy groves
Shakespeare,To see the general hunting in this forest?
Shakespeare,Saucy controller of our private steps!
Shakespeare,"Had I the power that some say Dian had,"
Shakespeare,Thy temples should be planted presently
Shakespeare,"With horns, as was Actaeon's, and the hounds"
Shakespeare,"Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,"
Shakespeare,Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
Shakespeare,"Under your patience, gentle empress,"
Shakespeare,"'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,"
Shakespeare,And to be doubted that your Moor and you
Shakespeare,Are singled forth to try experiments:
Shakespeare,Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
Shakespeare,'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
Shakespeare,"Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian"
Shakespeare,"Doth make your honour of his body's hue,"
Shakespeare,"Spotted, detested, and abominable."
Shakespeare,"Why are you sequester'd from all your train,"
Shakespeare,Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
Shakespeare,"And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,"
Shakespeare,"Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,"
Shakespeare,If foul desire had not conducted you?
Shakespeare,"And, being intercepted in your sport,"
Shakespeare,Great reason that my noble lord be rated
Shakespeare,"For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,"
Shakespeare,"And let her joy her raven-colour'd love,"
Shakespeare,This valley fits the purpose passing well.
Shakespeare,The king my brother shall have note of this.
Shakespeare,"Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:"
Shakespeare,"Good king, to be so mightily abused!"
Shakespeare,Why have I patience to endure all this?
Shakespeare,Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON
Shakespeare,"How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!"
Shakespeare,Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?
Shakespeare,"Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?"
Shakespeare,These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:
Shakespeare,"A barren detested vale, you see it is,"
Shakespeare,"The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,"
Shakespeare,O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:
Shakespeare,"Here never shines the sun, here nothing breeds,"
Shakespeare,Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:
Shakespeare,"And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,"
Shakespeare,"They told me, here, at dead time of the night,"
Shakespeare,"A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,"
Shakespeare,"Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,"
Shakespeare,Would make such fearful and confused cries
Shakespeare,As any mortal body hearing it
Shakespeare,"Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly."
Shakespeare,"No sooner had they told this hellish tale,"
Shakespeare,But straight they told me they would bind me here
Shakespeare,"Unto the body of a dismal yew,"
Shakespeare,And leave me to this miserable death:
Shakespeare,"And then they call'd me foul adulteress,"
Shakespeare,"Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms"
Shakespeare,That ever ear did hear to such effect:
Shakespeare,"And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,"
Shakespeare,This vengeance on me had they executed.
Shakespeare,"Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,"
Shakespeare,Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.
Shakespeare,This is a witness that I am thy son.
Shakespeare,Stabs BASSIANUS
Shakespeare,"And this for me, struck home to show my strength."
Shakespeare,"Also stabs BASSIANUS, who dies"
Shakespeare,"Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,"
Shakespeare,For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
Shakespeare,"Give me thy poniard, you shall know, my boys"
Shakespeare,Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
Shakespeare,"Stay, madam, here is more belongs to her,"
Shakespeare,"First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:"
Shakespeare,"This minion stood upon her chastity,"
Shakespeare,"Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,"
Shakespeare,And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:
Shakespeare,And shall she carry this unto her grave?
Shakespeare,"An if she do, I would I were an eunuch."
Shakespeare,"Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,"
Shakespeare,And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.
Shakespeare,"But when ye have the honey ye desire,"
Shakespeare,"Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting."
Shakespeare,"I warrant you, madam, we wil l make that sure."
Shakespeare,"Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy"
Shakespeare,That nice-preserved honesty of yours.
Shakespeare,"O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,--"
Shakespeare,"I will not hear her speak, away with her!"
Shakespeare,"Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word."
Shakespeare,"Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory"
Shakespeare,"To see her tears, but be your heart to them"
Shakespeare,As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
Shakespeare,When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
Shakespeare,"O, do not learn her wrath, she taught it thee,"
Shakespeare,"The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble,"
Shakespeare,Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
Shakespeare,Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:
Shakespeare,To CHIRON
Shakespeare,Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.
Shakespeare,"What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?"
Shakespeare,"'Tis true, the raven doth not hatch a lark:"
Shakespeare,"Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--"
Shakespeare,The lion moved with pity did endure
Shakespeare,To have his princely paws pared all away:
Shakespeare,"Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,"
Shakespeare,The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
Shakespeare,"O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,"
Shakespeare,"Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!"
Shakespeare,"I know not what it means, away with her!"
Shakespeare,"O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,"
Shakespeare,"That gave thee life, when well he might have"
Shakespeare,"slain thee,"
Shakespeare,"Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears."
Shakespeare,"Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,"
Shakespeare,Even for his sake am I pitiless.
Shakespeare,"Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,"
Shakespeare,"To save your brother from the sacrifice,"
Shakespeare,"But fierce Andronicus would not relent,"
Shakespeare,"Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,"
Shakespeare,"The worse to her, the better loved of me."
Shakespeare,"O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,"
Shakespeare,And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
Shakespeare,"For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long,"
Shakespeare,Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.
Shakespeare,"What begg'st thou, then? fond woman, let me go."
Shakespeare,"'Tis present death I beg, and one thing more"
Shakespeare,That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:
Shakespeare,"O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,"
Shakespeare,"And tumble me into some loathsome pit,"
Shakespeare,Where never man's eye may behold my body:
Shakespeare,"Do this, and be a charitable murderer."
Shakespeare,So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:
Shakespeare,"No, let them satisfy their lust on thee."
Shakespeare,Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.
Shakespeare,"No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature!"
Shakespeare,The blot and enemy to our general name!
Shakespeare,Confusion fall--
Shakespeare,"Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:"
Shakespeare,This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.
Shakespeare,"DEMETRIUS throws the body of BASSIANUS into the  pit, then exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, dragging off LAVINIA"
Shakespeare,"Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure."
Shakespeare,"Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,"
Shakespeare,Till all the Andronici be made away.
Shakespeare,"Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,"
Shakespeare,And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter AARON, with QUINTUS and MARTIUS"
Shakespeare,"Come on, my lords, the better foot before:"
Shakespeare,Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
Shakespeare,Where I espied the panther fast asleep.
Shakespeare,"My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes."
Shakespeare,"And mine, I promise you, were't not for shame,"
Shakespeare,Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.
Shakespeare,Falls into the pit
Shakespeare,"What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,"
Shakespeare,"Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,"
Shakespeare,Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
Shakespeare,As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?
Shakespeare,A very fatal place it seems to me.
Shakespeare,"Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?"
Shakespeare,"O brother, with the dismall'st object hurt"
Shakespeare,That ever eye with sight made heart lament!
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  Now will I fetch the king to find them here,"
Shakespeare,That he thereby may give a likely guess
Shakespeare,How these were they that made away his brother.
Shakespeare,"Why dost not comfort me, and help me out"
Shakespeare,From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?
Shakespeare,"I am surprised with an uncouth fear,"
Shakespeare,A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints:
Shakespeare,My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
Shakespeare,"To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,"
Shakespeare,"Aaron and thou look down into this den,"
Shakespeare,And see a fearful sight of blood and death.
Shakespeare,"Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart"
Shakespeare,Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
Shakespeare,"The thing whereat it trembles by surmise,"
Shakespeare,"O, tell me how it is, for ne'er till now"
Shakespeare,Was I a child to fear I know not what.
Shakespeare,"Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,"
Shakespeare,"All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,"
Shakespeare,"In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit."
Shakespeare,"If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?"
Shakespeare,Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
Shakespeare,"A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,"
Shakespeare,"Which, like a taper in some monument,"
Shakespeare,"Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,"
Shakespeare,And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:
Shakespeare,So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
Shakespeare,When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.
Shakespeare,"O brother, help me with thy fainting hand--"
Shakespeare,"If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath--"
Shakespeare,"Out of this fell devouring receptacle,"
Shakespeare,As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.
Shakespeare,"Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out,"
Shakespeare,"Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,"
Shakespeare,I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
Shakespeare,"Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave."
Shakespeare,I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
Shakespeare,Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
Shakespeare,"Thy hand once more, I will not loose again,"
Shakespeare,"Till thou art here aloft, or I below:"
Shakespeare,Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.
Shakespeare,Falls in
Shakespeare,Enter SATURNINUS with AARON
Shakespeare,"Along with me: I'll see what hole is here,"
Shakespeare,And what he is that now is leap'd into it.
Shakespeare,Say who art thou that lately didst descend
Shakespeare,Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
Shakespeare,The unhappy son of old Andronicus:
Shakespeare,"Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,"
Shakespeare,To find thy brother Bassianus dead.
Shakespeare,My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
Shakespeare,He and his lady both are at the lodge
Shakespeare,"Upon the north side of this pleasant chase,"
Shakespeare,'Tis not an hour since I left him there.
Shakespeare,"We know not where you left him all alive,"
Shakespeare,"But, out, alas! here have we found him dead."
Shakespeare,"Re-enter TAMORA, with Attendants, TITUS ANDRONICUS, and Lucius"
Shakespeare,Where is my lord the king?
Shakespeare,"Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief."
Shakespeare,Where is thy brother Bassianus?
Shakespeare,Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
Shakespeare,Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.
Shakespeare,"Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,"
Shakespeare,"The complot of this timeless tragedy,"
Shakespeare,And wonder greatly that man's face can fold
Shakespeare,In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.
Shakespeare,She giveth SATURNINUS a letter
Shakespeare,[Reads]  'An if we miss to meet him handsomely--
Shakespeare,"Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean--"
Shakespeare,Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:
Shakespeare,Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward
Shakespeare,Among the nettles at the elder-tree
Shakespeare,Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
Shakespeare,Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.
Shakespeare,"Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'"
Shakespeare,O Tamora! was ever heard the like?
Shakespeare,"This is the pit, and this the elder-tree."
Shakespeare,"Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out"
Shakespeare,That should have murdered Bassianus here.
Shakespeare,"My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold."
Shakespeare,"[To TITUS]  Two of thy whelps, fell curs of"
Shakespeare,"bloody kind,"
Shakespeare,Have here bereft my brother of his life.
Shakespeare,"Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison:"
Shakespeare,There let them bide until we have devised
Shakespeare,Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.
Shakespeare,"What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!"
Shakespeare,How easily murder is discovered!
Shakespeare,"High emperor, upon my feeble knee"
Shakespeare,"I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,"
Shakespeare,"That this fell fault of my accursed sons,"
Shakespeare,"Accursed if the fault be proved in them,--"
Shakespeare,If it be proved! you see it is apparent.
Shakespeare,"Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?"
Shakespeare,Andronicus himself did take it up.
Shakespeare,"I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail,"
Shakespeare,"For, by my father's reverend tomb, I vow"
Shakespeare,They shall be ready at your highness' will
Shakespeare,To answer their suspicion with their lives.
Shakespeare,Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.
Shakespeare,"Some bring the murder'd body, some the murderers:"
Shakespeare,"Let them not speak a word, the guilt is plain,"
Shakespeare,"For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,"
Shakespeare,That end upon them should be executed.
Shakespeare,"Andronicus, I will entreat the king,"
Shakespeare,"Fear not thy sons, they shall do well enough."
Shakespeare,"Come, Lucius, come, stay not to talk with them."
Shakespeare,SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.
Shakespeare,SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.
Shakespeare,"Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON with LAVINIA, ravished, her hands cut off, and her tongue cut out"
Shakespeare,"So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,"
Shakespeare,Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee.
Shakespeare,"Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,"
Shakespeare,An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.
Shakespeare,"See, how with signs and tokens she can scrowl."
Shakespeare,"Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands."
Shakespeare,"She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash,"
Shakespeare,And so let's leave her to her silent walks.
Shakespeare,"An 'twere my case, I should go hang myself."
Shakespeare,If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.
Shakespeare,Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON
Shakespeare,Enter MARCUS
Shakespeare,Enter MARCUS
Shakespeare,"Who is this? my niece, that flies away so fast!"
Shakespeare,"Cousin, a word, where is your husband?"
Shakespeare,"If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!"
Shakespeare,"If I do wake, some planet strike me down,"
Shakespeare,That I may slumber in eternal sleep!
Shakespeare,"Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands"
Shakespeare,Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
Shakespeare,"Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,"
Shakespeare,"Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,"
Shakespeare,And might not gain so great a happiness
Shakespeare,As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
Shakespeare,"Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,"
Shakespeare,"Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,"
Shakespeare,"Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,"
Shakespeare,Coming and going with thy honey breath.
Shakespeare,"But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,"
Shakespeare,"And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue."
Shakespeare,"Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!"
Shakespeare,"And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,"
Shakespeare,"As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,"
Shakespeare,Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
Shakespeare,Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.
Shakespeare,Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?
Shakespeare,"O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,"
Shakespeare,"That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!"
Shakespeare,"Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,"
Shakespeare,Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
Shakespeare,"Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,"
Shakespeare,And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:
Shakespeare,"But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee,"
Shakespeare,"A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,"
Shakespeare,"And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,"
Shakespeare,That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
Shakespeare,"O, had the monster seen those lily hands"
Shakespeare,"Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,"
Shakespeare,"And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,"
Shakespeare,He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
Shakespeare,"Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony"
Shakespeare,"Which that sweet tongue hath made,"
Shakespeare,"He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep"
Shakespeare,As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
Shakespeare,"Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,"
Shakespeare,For such a sight will blind a father's eye:
Shakespeare,"One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads,"
Shakespeare,What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
Shakespeare,"Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee"
Shakespeare,"O, could our mourning ease thy misery!"
Shakespeare,"Enter Judges, Senators and Tribunes, with MARTIUS  and QUINTUS, bound, passing on to the place of execution, TITUS going before, pleading"
Shakespeare,"Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!"
Shakespeare,"For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent"
Shakespeare,"In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept,"
Shakespeare,"For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed,"
Shakespeare,"For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd,"
Shakespeare,"And for these bitter tears, which now you see"
Shakespeare,"Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,"
Shakespeare,"Be pitiful to my condemned sons,"
Shakespeare,Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
Shakespeare,"For two and twenty sons I never wept,"
Shakespeare,Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
Shakespeare,"Lieth down, the Judges,  and c., pass by him, and Exeunt"
Shakespeare,"For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write"
Shakespeare,My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:
Shakespeare,"Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite,"
Shakespeare,My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
Shakespeare,"O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,"
Shakespeare,"That shall distil from these two ancient urns,"
Shakespeare,Than youthful April shall with all his showers:
Shakespeare,"In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still,"
Shakespeare,In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
Shakespeare,"And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,"
Shakespeare,So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.
Shakespeare,"Enter LUCIUS, with his sword drawn"
Shakespeare,"O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!"
Shakespeare,"Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death,"
Shakespeare,"And let me say, that never wept before,"
Shakespeare,My tears are now prevailing orators.
Shakespeare,"O noble father, you lament in vain:"
Shakespeare,"The tribunes hear you not, no man is by,"
Shakespeare,And you recount your sorrows to a stone.
Shakespeare,"Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead."
Shakespeare,"Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,--"
Shakespeare,"My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak."
Shakespeare,"Why, tis no matter, man, if they did hear,"
Shakespeare,"They would not mark me, or if they did mark,"
Shakespeare,"They would not pity me, yet plead I must,"
Shakespeare,"Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones,"
Shakespeare,"Who, though they cannot answer my distress,"
Shakespeare,"Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,"
Shakespeare,For that they will not intercept my tale:
Shakespeare,"When I do weep, they humbly at my feet"
Shakespeare,"Receive my tears and seem to weep with me,"
Shakespeare,"And, were they but attired in grave weeds,"
Shakespeare,Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
Shakespeare,"A stone is soft as wax,--tribunes more hard than stones,"
Shakespeare,"A stone is silent, and offendeth not,"
Shakespeare,And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
Shakespeare,But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?
Shakespeare,To rescue my two brothers from their death:
Shakespeare,For which attempt the judges have pronounced
Shakespeare,My everlasting doom of banishment.
Shakespeare,O happy man! they have befriended thee.
Shakespeare,"Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive"
Shakespeare,That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
Shakespeare,"Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey"
Shakespeare,"But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,"
Shakespeare,From these devourers to be banished!
Shakespeare,But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
Shakespeare,Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA
Shakespeare,"Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,"
Shakespeare,"Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:"
Shakespeare,I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.
Shakespeare,"Will it consume me? let me see it, then."
Shakespeare,This was thy daughter.
Shakespeare,"Why, Marcus, so she is."
Shakespeare,"Ay me, this object kills me!"
Shakespeare,"Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her."
Shakespeare,"Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand"
Shakespeare,Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
Shakespeare,"What fool hath added water to the sea,"
Shakespeare,Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
Shakespeare,"My grief was at the height before thou camest,"
Shakespeare,"And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds."
Shakespeare,"Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too,"
Shakespeare,"For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain,"
Shakespeare,"And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life,"
Shakespeare,"In bootless prayer have they been held up,"
Shakespeare,And they have served me to effectless use:
Shakespeare,Now all the service I require of them
Shakespeare,Is that the one will help to cut the other.
Shakespeare,"'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,"
Shakespeare,"For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain."
Shakespeare,"Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?"
Shakespeare,"O, that delightful engine of her thoughts"
Shakespeare,"That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,"
Shakespeare,"Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,"
Shakespeare,"Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung"
Shakespeare,"Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!"
Shakespeare,"O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?"
Shakespeare,"O, thus I found her, straying in the park,"
Shakespeare,"Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer"
Shakespeare,That hath received some unrecuring wound.
Shakespeare,"It was my deer, and he that wounded her"
Shakespeare,Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:
Shakespeare,For now I stand as one upon a rock
Shakespeare,"Environed with a wilderness of sea,"
Shakespeare,"Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,"
Shakespeare,Expecting ever when some envious surge
Shakespeare,Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
Shakespeare,"This way to death my wretched sons are gone,"
Shakespeare,"Here stands my other son, a banished man,"
Shakespeare,"And here my brother, weeping at my woes."
Shakespeare,"But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,"
Shakespeare,"Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul."
Shakespeare,"Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,"
Shakespeare,It would have madded me: what shall I do
Shakespeare,Now I behold thy lively body so?
Shakespeare,"Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:"
Shakespeare,"Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:"
Shakespeare,Thy husband he is dead: and for his death
Shakespeare,"Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this."
Shakespeare,"Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!"
Shakespeare,"When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears"
Shakespeare,"Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew"
Shakespeare,Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.
Shakespeare,"Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband,"
Shakespeare,Perchance because she knows them innocent.
Shakespeare,"If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful"
Shakespeare,Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
Shakespeare,"No, no, they would not do so foul a deed,"
Shakespeare,Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
Shakespeare,"Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips."
Shakespeare,Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:
Shakespeare,"Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,"
Shakespeare,"And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,"
Shakespeare,Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
Shakespeare,"How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,"
Shakespeare,With miry slime left on them by a flood?
Shakespeare,And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
Shakespeare,"Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,"
Shakespeare,And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?
Shakespeare,"Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?"
Shakespeare,"Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows"
Shakespeare,Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
Shakespeare,"What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,"
Shakespeare,"Plot some deuce of further misery,"
Shakespeare,To make us wonder'd at in time to come.
Shakespeare,"Sweet father, cease your tears, for, at your grief,"
Shakespeare,See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
Shakespeare,"Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes."
Shakespeare,"Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot"
Shakespeare,"Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,"
Shakespeare,"For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own."
Shakespeare,"Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks."
Shakespeare,"Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:"
Shakespeare,"Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say"
Shakespeare,That to her brother which I said to thee:
Shakespeare,"His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,"
Shakespeare,Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
Shakespeare,"O, what a sympathy of woe is this,"
Shakespeare,As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!
Shakespeare,"Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor"
Shakespeare,"Sends thee this word,--that, if thou love thy sons,"
Shakespeare,"Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,"
Shakespeare,"Or any one of you, chop off your hand,"
Shakespeare,And send it to the king: he for the same
Shakespeare,"Will send thee hither both thy sons alive,"
Shakespeare,And that shall be the ransom for their fault.
Shakespeare,O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!
Shakespeare,"Did ever raven sing so like a lark,"
Shakespeare,That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
Shakespeare,"With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand:"
Shakespeare,"Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?"
Shakespeare,"Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,"
Shakespeare,"That hath thrown down so many enemies,"
Shakespeare,Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:
Shakespeare,"My youth can better spare my blood than you,"
Shakespeare,And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
Shakespeare,"Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,"
Shakespeare,"And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,"
Shakespeare,Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?
Shakespeare,"O, none of both but are of high desert:"
Shakespeare,"My hand hath been but idle, let it serve"
Shakespeare,"To ransom my two nephews from their death,"
Shakespeare,Then have I kept it to a worthy end.
Shakespeare,"Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,"
Shakespeare,For fear they die before their pardon come.
Shakespeare,My hand shall go.
Shakespeare,"By heaven, it shall not go!"
Shakespeare,"Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these"
Shakespeare,"Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine."
Shakespeare,"Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,"
Shakespeare,Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
Shakespeare,"And, for our father's sake and mother's care,"
Shakespeare,Now let me show a brother's love to thee.
Shakespeare,"Agree between you, I will spare my hand."
Shakespeare,Then I'll go fetch an axe.
Shakespeare,But I will use the axe.
Shakespeare,Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS
Shakespeare,"Come hither, Aaron, I'll deceive them both:"
Shakespeare,"Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine."
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,"
Shakespeare,"And never, whilst I live, deceive men so:"
Shakespeare,"But I'll deceive you in another sort,"
Shakespeare,"And that you'll say, ere half an hour pass."
Shakespeare,Cuts off TITUS's hand
Shakespeare,Re-enter LUCIUS and MARCUS
Shakespeare,Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatch'd.
Shakespeare,"Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:"
Shakespeare,Tell him it was a hand that warded him
Shakespeare,"From thousand dangers, bid him bury it"
Shakespeare,"More hath it merited, that let it have."
Shakespeare,"As for my sons, say I account of them"
Shakespeare,"As jewels purchased at an easy price,"
Shakespeare,"And yet dear too, because I bought mine own."
Shakespeare,"I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand"
Shakespeare,Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
Shakespeare,"Their heads, I mean. O, how this villany"
Shakespeare,Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
Shakespeare,"Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace."
Shakespeare,Aaron will have his soul black like his face.
Shakespeare,"O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,"
Shakespeare,And bow this feeble ruin to the earth:
Shakespeare,"If any power pities wretched tears,"
Shakespeare,To that I call!
Shakespeare,To LAVINIA
Shakespeare,To LAVINIA
Shakespeare,"What, wilt thou kneel with me?"
Shakespeare,"Do, then, dear heart, for heaven shall hear our prayers,"
Shakespeare,"Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim,"
Shakespeare,"And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds"
Shakespeare,When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.
Shakespeare,"O brother, speak with possibilities,"
Shakespeare,And do not break into these deep extremes.
Shakespeare,"Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?"
Shakespeare,Then be my passions bottomless with them.
Shakespeare,But yet let reason govern thy lament.
Shakespeare,"If there were reason for these miseries,"
Shakespeare,Then into limits could I bind my woes:
Shakespeare,"When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?"
Shakespeare,"If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,"
Shakespeare,Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?
Shakespeare,And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
Shakespeare,"I am the sea, hark, how her sighs do blow!"
Shakespeare,"She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:"
Shakespeare,"Then must my sea be moved with her sighs,"
Shakespeare,Then must my earth with her continual tears
Shakespeare,"Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd,"
Shakespeare,"For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,"
Shakespeare,But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
Shakespeare,"Then give me leave, for losers will have leave"
Shakespeare,To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
Shakespeare,"Enter a Messenger, with two heads and a hand"
Shakespeare,"Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid"
Shakespeare,For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor.
Shakespeare,"Here are the heads of thy two noble sons,"
Shakespeare,"And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back,"
Shakespeare,"Thy griefs their sports, thy resolution mock'd,"
Shakespeare,That woe is me to think upon thy woes
Shakespeare,More than remembrance of my father's death.
Shakespeare,"Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily,"
Shakespeare,And be my heart an ever-burning hell!
Shakespeare,These miseries are more than may be borne.
Shakespeare,"To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal,"
Shakespeare,But sorrow flouted at is double death.
Shakespeare,"Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,"
Shakespeare,And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
Shakespeare,"That ever death should let life bear his name,"
Shakespeare,Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!
Shakespeare,LAVINIA kisses TITUS
Shakespeare,"Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless"
Shakespeare,As frozen water to a starved snake.
Shakespeare,When will this fearful slumber have an end?
Shakespeare,"Now, farewell, flattery: die, Andronicus,"
Shakespeare,"Thou dost not slumber: see, thy two sons' heads,"
Shakespeare,"Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here:"
Shakespeare,"Thy other banish'd son, with this dear sight"
Shakespeare,"Struck pale and bloodless, and thy brother, I,"
Shakespeare,"Even like a stony image, cold and numb."
Shakespeare,"Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs:"
Shakespeare,"Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand"
Shakespeare,"Gnawing with thy teeth, and be this dismal sight"
Shakespeare,"The closing up of our most wretched eyes,"
Shakespeare,"Now is a time to storm, why art thou still?"
Shakespeare,Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this hour.
Shakespeare,"Why, I have not another tear to shed:"
Shakespeare,"Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,"
Shakespeare,And would usurp upon my watery eyes
Shakespeare,And make them blind with tributary tears:
Shakespeare,Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
Shakespeare,"For these two heads do seem to speak to me,"
Shakespeare,And threat me I shall never come to bliss
Shakespeare,Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
Shakespeare,Even in their throats that have committed them.
Shakespeare,"Come, let me see what task I have to do."
Shakespeare,"You heavy people, circle me about,"
Shakespeare,"That I may turn me to each one of you,"
Shakespeare,And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
Shakespeare,"The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,"
Shakespeare,And in this hand the other I will bear.
Shakespeare,"Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!"
Shakespeare,"Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth."
Shakespeare,"As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight,"
Shakespeare,"Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:"
Shakespeare,"Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:"
Shakespeare,"And, if you love me, as I think you do,"
Shakespeare,"Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do."
Shakespeare,"Exeunt TITUS, MARCUS, and LAVINIA"
Shakespeare,"Farewell Andronicus, my noble father,"
Shakespeare,The wofull'st man that ever lived in Rome:
Shakespeare,"Farewell, proud Rome, till Lucius come again,"
Shakespeare,He leaves his pledges dearer than his life:
Shakespeare,"Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister,"
Shakespeare,"O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!"
Shakespeare,But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
Shakespeare,But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
Shakespeare,"If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs,"
Shakespeare,And make proud Saturnine and his empress
Shakespeare,"Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen."
Shakespeare,"Now will I to the Goths, and raise a power,"
Shakespeare,To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. A room in Titus's house. A banquet set out.
Shakespeare,"Enter TITUS, MARCUS, LAVINIA and Young LUCIUS, a boy"
Shakespeare,"So, so, now sit: and look you eat no more"
Shakespeare,Than will preserve just so much strength in us
Shakespeare,As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
Shakespeare,"Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:"
Shakespeare,"Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,"
Shakespeare,And cannot passionate our tenfold grief
Shakespeare,With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine
Shakespeare,"Is left to tyrannize upon my breast,"
Shakespeare,"Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,"
Shakespeare,"Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,"
Shakespeare,Then thus I thump it down.
Shakespeare,"Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!"
Shakespeare,"When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,"
Shakespeare,Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.
Shakespeare,"Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans,"
Shakespeare,"Or get some little knife between thy teeth,"
Shakespeare,"And just against thy heart make thou a hole,"
Shakespeare,That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
Shakespeare,"May run into that sink, and soaking in"
Shakespeare,Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.
Shakespeare,"Fie, brother, fie! teach her not thus to lay"
Shakespeare,Such violent hands upon her tender life.
Shakespeare,How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?
Shakespeare,"Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I."
Shakespeare,What violent hands can she lay on her life?
Shakespeare,"Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands,"
Shakespeare,"To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er,"
Shakespeare,How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
Shakespeare,"O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,"
Shakespeare,Lest we remember still that we have none.
Shakespeare,"Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,"
Shakespeare,"As if we should forget we had no hands,"
Shakespeare,If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
Shakespeare,"Come, let's fall to, and, gentle girl, eat this:"
Shakespeare,"Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says,"
Shakespeare,"I can interpret all her martyr'd signs,"
Shakespeare,"She says she drinks no other drink but tears,"
Shakespeare,"Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks:"
Shakespeare,"Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought,"
Shakespeare,In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
Shakespeare,As begging hermits in their holy prayers:
Shakespeare,"Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,"
Shakespeare,"Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,"
Shakespeare,But I of these will wrest an alphabet
Shakespeare,And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.
Shakespeare,"Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments:"
Shakespeare,Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.
Shakespeare,"Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,"
Shakespeare,Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.
Shakespeare,"Peace, tender sapling, thou art made of tears,"
Shakespeare,And tears will quickly melt thy life away.
Shakespeare,MARCUS strikes the dish with a knife
Shakespeare,"What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?"
Shakespeare,"At that that I have kill'd, my lord, a fly."
Shakespeare,"Out on thee, murderer! thou kill'st my heart,"
Shakespeare,Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny:
Shakespeare,A deed of death done on the innocent
Shakespeare,Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone:
Shakespeare,I see thou art not for my company.
Shakespeare,"Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly."
Shakespeare,"But how, if that fly had a father and mother?"
Shakespeare,"How would he hang his slender gilded wings,"
Shakespeare,And buzz lamenting doings in the air!
Shakespeare,"Poor harmless fly,"
Shakespeare,"That, with his pretty buzzing melody,"
Shakespeare,Came here to make us merry! and thou hast
Shakespeare,kill'd him.
Shakespeare,"Pardon me, sir, it was a black ill-favor'd fly,"
Shakespeare,"Like to the empress' Moor, therefore I kill'd him."
Shakespeare,"O, O, O,"
Shakespeare,"Then pardon me for reprehending thee,"
Shakespeare,For thou hast done a charitable deed.
Shakespeare,"Give me thy knife, I will insult on him,"
Shakespeare,"Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor"
Shakespeare,Come hither purposely to poison me.--
Shakespeare,"There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora."
Shakespeare,"Ah, sirrah!"
Shakespeare,"Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,"
Shakespeare,But that between us we can kill a fly
Shakespeare,That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.
Shakespeare,"Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,"
Shakespeare,He takes false shadows for true substances.
Shakespeare,"Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:"
Shakespeare,"I'll to thy closet, and go read with thee"
Shakespeare,Sad stories chanced in the times of old.
Shakespeare,"Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,"
Shakespeare,And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Rome. Titus's garden.
Shakespeare,"Enter young LUCIUS, and LAVINIA running after him,  and the boy flies from her, with books under his arm. Then enter TITUS and MARCUS"
Shakespeare,"Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia"
Shakespeare,"Follows me every where, I know not why:"
Shakespeare,"Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes."
Shakespeare,"Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean."
Shakespeare,"Stand by me, Lucius, do not fear thine aunt."
Shakespeare,"She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm."
Shakespeare,"Ay, when my father was in Rome she did."
Shakespeare,What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
Shakespeare,"Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:"
Shakespeare,"See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:"
Shakespeare,Somewhither would she have thee go with her.
Shakespeare,"Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care"
Shakespeare,Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
Shakespeare,Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.
Shakespeare,Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
Shakespeare,"My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,"
Shakespeare,Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:
Shakespeare,"For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,"
Shakespeare,"Extremity of griefs would make men mad,"
Shakespeare,And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
Shakespeare,"Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear,"
Shakespeare,"Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt"
Shakespeare,"Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,"
Shakespeare,"And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:"
Shakespeare,"Which made me down to throw my books, and fly--"
Shakespeare,"Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:"
Shakespeare,"And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,"
Shakespeare,I will most willingly attend your ladyship.
Shakespeare,"Lucius, I will."
Shakespeare,LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which LUCIUS has let fall
Shakespeare,"How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?"
Shakespeare,Some book there is that she desires to see.
Shakespeare,"Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy."
Shakespeare,"But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd"
Shakespeare,"Come, and take choice of all my library,"
Shakespeare,"And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens"
Shakespeare,Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
Shakespeare,Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
Shakespeare,I think she means that there was more than one
Shakespeare,"Confederate in the fact: ay, more there was,"
Shakespeare,Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.
Shakespeare,"Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?"
Shakespeare,"Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses,"
Shakespeare,My mother gave it me.
Shakespeare,"For love of her that's gone,"
Shakespeare,Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
Shakespeare,Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!
Shakespeare,Helping her
Shakespeare,"What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?"
Shakespeare,"This is the tragic tale of Philomel,"
Shakespeare,And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:
Shakespeare,"And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy."
Shakespeare,"See, brother, see, note how she quotes the leaves."
Shakespeare,"Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,"
Shakespeare,"Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,"
Shakespeare,"Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!"
Shakespeare,"Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--"
Shakespeare,"O, had we never, never hunted there!--"
Shakespeare,"Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,"
Shakespeare,By nature made for murders and for rapes.
Shakespeare,"O, why should nature build so foul a den,"
Shakespeare,Unless the gods delight in tragedies?
Shakespeare,"Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none"
Shakespeare,"but friends,"
Shakespeare,What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:
Shakespeare,"Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,"
Shakespeare,That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?
Shakespeare,"Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me."
Shakespeare,"Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,"
Shakespeare,"Inspire me, that I may this treason find!"
Shakespeare,"My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:"
Shakespeare,"This sandy plot is plain, guide, if thou canst"
Shakespeare,"This after me, when I have writ my name"
Shakespeare,Without the help of any hand at all.
Shakespeare,"He writes his name with his staff, and guides it with feet and mouth"
Shakespeare,Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!
Shakespeare,"Write thou good niece, and here display, at last,"
Shakespeare,"What God will have discover'd for revenge,"
Shakespeare,"Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,"
Shakespeare,That we may know the traitors and the truth!
Shakespeare,"She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it with her stumps, and writes"
Shakespeare,"O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?"
Shakespeare,'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'
Shakespeare,"What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora"
Shakespeare,"Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?"
Shakespeare,"Magni Dominator poli,"
Shakespeare,Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?
Shakespeare,"O, calm thee, gentle lord, although I know"
Shakespeare,There is enough written upon this earth
Shakespeare,To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
Shakespeare,And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
Shakespeare,"My lord, kneel down with me, Lavinia, kneel,"
Shakespeare,"And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope,"
Shakespeare,"And swear with me, as, with the woful fere"
Shakespeare,"And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,"
Shakespeare,"Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,"
Shakespeare,That we will prosecute by good advice
Shakespeare,"Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,"
Shakespeare,"And see their blood, or die with this reproach."
Shakespeare,"'Tis sure enough, an you knew how."
Shakespeare,"But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:"
Shakespeare,"The dam will wake, and, if she wind you once,"
Shakespeare,"She's with the lion deeply still in league,"
Shakespeare,"And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,"
Shakespeare,And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
Shakespeare,"You are a young huntsman, Marcus, let it alone,"
Shakespeare,"And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,"
Shakespeare,"And with a gad of steel will write these words,"
Shakespeare,And lay it by: the angry northern wind
Shakespeare,"Will blow these sands, like Sibyl's leaves, abroad,"
Shakespeare,"And where's your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?"
Shakespeare,"I say, my lord, that if I were a man,"
Shakespeare,Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe
Shakespeare,For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.
Shakespeare,"Ay, that's my boy! thy father hath full oft"
Shakespeare,For his ungrateful country done the like.
Shakespeare,"And, uncle, so will I, an if I live."
Shakespeare,"Come, go with me into mine armoury,"
Shakespeare,"Lucius, I'll fit thee, and withal, my boy,"
Shakespeare,Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons
Shakespeare,Presents that I intend to send them both:
Shakespeare,"Come, come, thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire."
Shakespeare,"No, boy, not so, I'll teach thee another course."
Shakespeare,"Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:"
Shakespeare,Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:
Shakespeare,"Ay, marry, will we, sir, and we'll be waited on."
Shakespeare,"Exeunt TITUS, LAVINIA, and Young LUCIUS"
Shakespeare,"O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,"
Shakespeare,"And not relent, or not compassion him?"
Shakespeare,"Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,"
Shakespeare,That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
Shakespeare,"Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield,"
Shakespeare,But yet so just that he will not revenge.
Shakespeare,"Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!"
Shakespeare,SCENE II. The same. A room in the palace.
Shakespeare,"Enter, from one side, AARON, DEMETRIUS, and  CHIRON, from the other side, Young LUCIUS, and an  Attendant, with a bundle of weapons, and verses writ upon them"
Shakespeare,"Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius,"
Shakespeare,He hath some message to deliver us.
Shakespeare,"Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather."
Shakespeare,"My lords, with all the humbleness I may,"
Shakespeare,I greet your honours from Andronicus.
Shakespeare,And pray the Roman gods confound you both!
Shakespeare,"Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?"
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,"
Shakespeare,"For villains mark'd with rape.--May it please you,"
Shakespeare,"My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me"
Shakespeare,The goodliest weapons of his armoury
Shakespeare,"To gratify your honourable youth,"
Shakespeare,"The hope of Rome, for so he bade me say,"
Shakespeare,"And so I do, and with his gifts present"
Shakespeare,"Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,"
Shakespeare,You may be armed and appointed well:
Shakespeare,And so I leave you both:
Shakespeare,like bloody villains.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt Young LUCIUS, and Attendant"
Shakespeare,"What's here? A scroll, and written round about?"
Shakespeare,"Let's see,"
Shakespeare,"'Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,"
Shakespeare,"Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu.'"
Shakespeare,"O, 'tis a verse in Horace, I know it well:"
Shakespeare,I read it in the grammar long ago.
Shakespeare,"Ay, just, a verse in Horace, right, you have it."
Shakespeare,"Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!"
Shakespeare,"Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt,"
Shakespeare,"And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,"
Shakespeare,"That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick."
Shakespeare,"But were our witty empress well afoot,"
Shakespeare,She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:
Shakespeare,But let her rest in her unrest awhile.
Shakespeare,"And now, young lords, was't not a happy star"
Shakespeare,"Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,"
Shakespeare,"Captives, to be advanced to this height?"
Shakespeare,"It did me good, before the palace gate"
Shakespeare,To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.
Shakespeare,"But me more good, to see so great a lord"
Shakespeare,Basely insinuate and send us gifts.
Shakespeare,"Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?"
Shakespeare,Did you not use his daughter very friendly?
Shakespeare,I would we had a thousand Roman dames
Shakespeare,"At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust."
Shakespeare,A charitable wish and full of love.
Shakespeare,Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
Shakespeare,And that would she for twenty thousand more.
Shakespeare,"Come, let us go, and pray to all the gods"
Shakespeare,For our beloved mother in her pains.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  Pray to the devils, the gods have given us over."
Shakespeare,Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
Shakespeare,"Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son."
Shakespeare,"Enter a Nurse, with a blackamoor Child in her arms"
Shakespeare,"Good morr ow, lords:"
Shakespeare,"O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?"
Shakespeare,"Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,"
Shakespeare,"Here Aaron is, and what with Aaron now?"
Shakespeare,"O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!"
Shakespeare,"Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!"
Shakespeare,"Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!"
Shakespeare,What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?
Shakespeare,"O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,"
Shakespeare,"Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!"
Shakespeare,"She is deliver'd, lords, she is deliver'd."
Shakespeare,"I mean, she is brought a-bed."
Shakespeare,"Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?"
Shakespeare,A devil.
Shakespeare,"Why, then she is the devil's dam, a joyful issue."
Shakespeare,"A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue:"
Shakespeare,"Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad"
Shakespeare,Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:
Shakespeare,"The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,"
Shakespeare,And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.
Shakespeare,"'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?"
Shakespeare,"Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure."
Shakespeare,"Villain, what hast thou done?"
Shakespeare,That which thou canst not undo.
Shakespeare,Thou hast undone our mother.
Shakespeare,"Villain, I have done thy mother."
Shakespeare,"And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone."
Shakespeare,"Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!"
Shakespeare,Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!
Shakespeare,It shall not live.
Shakespeare,It shall not die.
Shakespeare,"Aaron, it must, the mother wills it so."
Shakespeare,"What, must it, nurse? then let no man but I"
Shakespeare,Do execution on my flesh and blood.
Shakespeare,I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:
Shakespeare,"Nurse, give it me, my sword shall soon dispatch it."
Shakespeare,Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
Shakespeare,"Takes the Child from the Nurse, and draws"
Shakespeare,"Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?"
Shakespeare,"Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,"
Shakespeare,"That shone so brightly when this boy was got,"
Shakespeare,He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
Shakespeare,That touches this my first-born son and heir!
Shakespeare,"I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,"
Shakespeare,"With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,"
Shakespeare,"Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,"
Shakespeare,Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
Shakespeare,"What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!"
Shakespeare,Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!
Shakespeare,"Coal-black is better than another hue,"
Shakespeare,"In that it scorns to bear another hue,"
Shakespeare,For all the water in the ocean
Shakespeare,"Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,"
Shakespeare,Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
Shakespeare,"Tell the empress from me, I am of age"
Shakespeare,"To keep mine own, excuse it how she can."
Shakespeare,Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
Shakespeare,"My mistress is my mistress, this myself,"
Shakespeare,The vigour and the picture of my youth:
Shakespeare,"This before all the world do I prefer,"
Shakespeare,"This maugre all the world will I keep safe,"
Shakespeare,Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
Shakespeare,By this our mother is forever shamed.
Shakespeare,Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
Shakespeare,"The emperor, in his rage, will doom her death."
Shakespeare,I blush to think upon this ignomy.
Shakespeare,"Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:"
Shakespeare,"Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing"
Shakespeare,The close enacts and counsels of the heart!
Shakespeare,Here's a young lad framed of another leer:
Shakespeare,"Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,"
Shakespeare,"As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'"
Shakespeare,"He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed"
Shakespeare,"Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,"
Shakespeare,And from that womb where you imprison'd were
Shakespeare,He is enfranchised and come to light:
Shakespeare,"Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,"
Shakespeare,Although my seal be stamped in his face.
Shakespeare,"Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?"
Shakespeare,"Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,"
Shakespeare,And we will all subscribe to thy advice:
Shakespeare,"Save thou the child, so we may all be safe."
Shakespeare,"Then sit we down, and let us all consult."
Shakespeare,My son and I will have the wind of you:
Shakespeare,Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.
Shakespeare,How many women saw this child of his?
Shakespeare,"Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league,"
Shakespeare,"I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,"
Shakespeare,"The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,"
Shakespeare,The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
Shakespeare,"But say, again, how many saw the child?"
Shakespeare,"Cornelia the midwife and myself,"
Shakespeare,And no one else but the deliver'd empress.
Shakespeare,"The empress, the midwife, and yourself:"
Shakespeare,Two may keep counsel when the third's away:
Shakespeare,"Go to the empress, tell her this I said."
Shakespeare,He kills the nurse
Shakespeare,"Weke, weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit."
Shakespeare,"What mean'st thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?"
Shakespeare,"O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy:"
Shakespeare,"Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,"
Shakespeare,"A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:"
Shakespeare,And now be it known to you my full intent.
Shakespeare,"Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman,"
Shakespeare,"His wife but yesternight was brought to bed,"
Shakespeare,"His child is like to her, fair as you are:"
Shakespeare,"Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,"
Shakespeare,"And tell them both the circumstance of all,"
Shakespeare,"And how by this their child shall be advanced,"
Shakespeare,"And be received for the emperor's heir,"
Shakespeare,"And substituted in the place of mine,"
Shakespeare,"To calm this tempest whirling in the court,"
Shakespeare,And let the emperor dandle him for his own.
Shakespeare,"Hark ye, lords, ye see I have given her physic,"
Shakespeare,Pointing to the nurse
Shakespeare,"And you must needs bestow her funeral,"
Shakespeare,"The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:"
Shakespeare,"This done, see that you take no longer days,"
Shakespeare,But send the midwife presently to me.
Shakespeare,"The midwife and the nurse well made away,"
Shakespeare,Then let the ladies tattle what they please.
Shakespeare,"Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air"
Shakespeare,With secrets.
Shakespeare,"For this care of Tamora,"
Shakespeare,Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.
Shakespeare,Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the Nurse's body
Shakespeare,"Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,"
Shakespeare,"There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,"
Shakespeare,And secretly to greet the empress' friends.
Shakespeare,"Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence,"
Shakespeare,For it is you that puts us to our shifts:
Shakespeare,"I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,"
Shakespeare,"And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,"
Shakespeare,"And cabin in a cave, and bring you up"
Shakespeare,"To be a warrior, and command a camp."
Shakespeare,SCENE III. The same. A public place.
Shakespeare,"Enter TITUS, bearing arrows with letters at the  ends of them, with him, MARCUS, Young LUCIUS,  PUBLIUS, SEMPRONIUS, CAIUS, and other Gentlemen, with bows"
Shakespeare,"Come, Marcus, come, kinsmen, this is the way."
Shakespeare,"Sir boy, now let me see your archery,"
Shakespeare,"Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight."
Shakespeare,Terras Astraea reliquit:
Shakespeare,"Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled."
Shakespeare,"Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall"
Shakespeare,"Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets,"
Shakespeare,"Happily you may catch her in the sea,"
Shakespeare,Yet there's as little justice as at land:
Shakespeare,"No, Publius and Sempronius, you must do it,"
Shakespeare,"'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,"
Shakespeare,And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:
Shakespeare,"Then, when you come to Pluto's region,"
Shakespeare,"I pray you, deliver him this petition,"
Shakespeare,"Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,"
Shakespeare,"And that it comes from old Andronicus,"
Shakespeare,Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
Shakespeare,"Ah, Rome! Well, well, I made thee miserable"
Shakespeare,What time I threw the people's suffrages
Shakespeare,On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.
Shakespeare,"Go, get you gone, and pray be careful all,"
Shakespeare,And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:
Shakespeare,"This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence,"
Shakespeare,"And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice."
Shakespeare,"O Publius, is not this a heavy case,"
Shakespeare,To see thy noble uncle thus distract?
Shakespeare,"Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns"
Shakespeare,"By day and night to attend him carefully,"
Shakespeare,"And feed his humour kindly as we may,"
Shakespeare,Till time beget some careful remedy.
Shakespeare,"Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy."
Shakespeare,"Join with the Goths, and with revengeful war"
Shakespeare,"Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,"
Shakespeare,And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.
Shakespeare,"Publius, how now! how now, my masters!"
Shakespeare,"What, have you met with her?"
Shakespeare,"No, my good lord, but Pluto sends you word,"
Shakespeare,"If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall:"
Shakespeare,"Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,"
Shakespeare,"He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,"
Shakespeare,So that perforce you must needs stay a time.
Shakespeare,He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
Shakespeare,"I'll dive into the burning lake below,"
Shakespeare,And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.
Shakespeare,"Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we"
Shakespeare,"No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size,"
Shakespeare,"But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,"
Shakespeare,Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:
Shakespeare,"And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,"
Shakespeare,We will solicit heaven and move the gods
Shakespeare,To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.
Shakespeare,"Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus,"
Shakespeare,He gives them the arrows
Shakespeare,"'Ad Jovem,' that's for you: here, 'Ad Apollinem:'"
Shakespeare,"'Ad Martem,' that's for myself:"
Shakespeare,"Here, boy, to Pallas: here, to Mercury:"
Shakespeare,"To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine,"
Shakespeare,You were as good to shoot against the wind.
Shakespeare,"To it, boy! Marcus, loose when I bid."
Shakespeare,"Of my word, I have written to effect,"
Shakespeare,There's not a god left unsolicited.
Shakespeare,"Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:"
Shakespeare,We will afflict the emperor in his pride.
Shakespeare,"Now, masters, draw."
Shakespeare,They shoot
Shakespeare,"O, well said, Lucius!"
Shakespeare,"Good boy, in Virgo's lap, give it Pallas."
Shakespeare,"My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon,"
Shakespeare,Your letter is with Jupiter by this.
Shakespeare,"Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?"
Shakespeare,"See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns."
Shakespeare,"This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,"
Shakespeare,"The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock"
Shakespeare,"That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court,"
Shakespeare,And who should find them but the empress' villain?
Shakespeare,"She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose"
Shakespeare,But give them to his master for a present.
Shakespeare,"Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy!"
Shakespeare,"Enter a Clown, with a basket, and two pigeons in it"
Shakespeare,"News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come."
Shakespeare,"Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?"
Shakespeare,Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?
Shakespeare,"O, the gibbet-maker! he says that he hath taken"
Shakespeare,"them down again, for the man must not be hanged till"
Shakespeare,the next week.
Shakespeare,"But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?"
Shakespeare,"Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter, I never drank with him"
Shakespeare,in all my life.
Shakespeare,"Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, of my pigeons, sir, nothing else."
Shakespeare,"Why, didst thou not come from heaven?"
Shakespeare,"From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there     God"
Shakespeare,forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my
Shakespeare,"young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the"
Shakespeare,"tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl"
Shakespeare,betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.
Shakespeare,"Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for"
Shakespeare,"your oration, and let him deliver the pigeons to"
Shakespeare,the emperor from you.
Shakespeare,"Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor"
Shakespeare,with a grace?
Shakespeare,"Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life."
Shakespeare,"Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,"
Shakespeare,But give your pigeons to the emperor:
Shakespeare,By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
Shakespeare,"Hold, hold, meanwhile here's money for thy charges."
Shakespeare,"Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace"
Shakespeare,deliver a supplication?
Shakespeare,Then here is a supplication for you. And when you
Shakespeare,"come to him, at the first approach you must kneel,"
Shakespeare,"then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and"
Shakespeare,"then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir, see"
Shakespeare,you do it bravely.
Shakespeare,"I warrant you, sir, let me alone."
Shakespeare,"Sirrah, hast thou a knife? come, let me see it."
Shakespeare,"Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration,"
Shakespeare,For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.
Shakespeare,"And when thou hast given it the emperor,"
Shakespeare,"Knock at my door, and tell me what he says."
Shakespeare,"God be with you, sir, I will."
Shakespeare,"Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me."
Shakespeare,SCENE IV. The same. Before the palace.
Shakespeare,"Enter SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON,  Lords, and others, SATURNINUS with the arrows in his hand that TITUS shot"
Shakespeare,"Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen"
Shakespeare,"An emperor in Rome thus overborne,"
Shakespeare,"Troubled, confronted thus, and, for the extent"
Shakespeare,"Of egal justice, used in such contempt?"
Shakespeare,"My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,"
Shakespeare,However these disturbers of our peace
Shakespeare,"Buz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd,"
Shakespeare,"But even with law, against the willful sons"
Shakespeare,Of old Andronicus. And what an if
Shakespeare,"His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,"
Shakespeare,"Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,"
Shakespeare,"His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?"
Shakespeare,And now he writes to heaven for his redress:
Shakespeare,"See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury,"
Shakespeare,"This to Apollo, this to the god of war,"
Shakespeare,Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
Shakespeare,"What's this but libelling against the senate,"
Shakespeare,And blazoning our injustice every where?
Shakespeare,"A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?"
Shakespeare,"As who would say, in Rome no justice were."
Shakespeare,"But if I live, his feigned ecstasies"
Shakespeare,Shall be no shelter to these outrages:
Shakespeare,But he and his shall know that justice lives
Shakespeare,"In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,"
Shakespeare,He'll so awake as she in fury shall
Shakespeare,Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
Shakespeare,"My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,"
Shakespeare,"Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,"
Shakespeare,"Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,"
Shakespeare,"The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,"
Shakespeare,"Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart,"
Shakespeare,And rather comfort his distressed plight
Shakespeare,Than prosecute the meanest or the best
Shakespeare,For these contempts.
Shakespeare,"Why, thus it shall become"
Shakespeare,High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:
Shakespeare,"But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,"
Shakespeare,"Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,"
Shakespeare,"Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port."
Shakespeare,"How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?"
Shakespeare,"Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial."
Shakespeare,"Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor."
Shakespeare,'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:
Shakespeare,I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.
Shakespeare,SATURNINUS reads the letter
Shakespeare,"Go, take him away, and hang him presently."
Shakespeare,How much money must I have?
Shakespeare,"Come, sirrah, you must be hanged."
Shakespeare,"Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to"
Shakespeare,a fair end.
Shakespeare,Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
Shakespeare,Shall I endure this monstrous villany?
Shakespeare,I know from whence this same device proceeds:
Shakespeare,"May this be borne?--as if his traitorous sons,"
Shakespeare,"That died by law for murder of our brother,"
Shakespeare,Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!
Shakespeare,"Go, drag the villain hither by the hair,"
Shakespeare,Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:
Shakespeare,"For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman,"
Shakespeare,"Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,"
Shakespeare,In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.
Shakespeare,Enter AEMILIUS
Shakespeare,Enter AEMILIUS
Shakespeare,"What news with thee, AEmilius?"
Shakespeare,"Arm, arm, my lord,--Rome never had more cause."
Shakespeare,"The Goths have gather'd head, and with a power"
Shakespeare,"high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,"
Shakespeare,"They hither march amain, under conduct"
Shakespeare,"Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus,"
Shakespeare,"Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do"
Shakespeare,As much as ever Coriolanus did.
Shakespeare,Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
Shakespeare,"These tidings nip me, and I hang the head"
Shakespeare,As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:
Shakespeare,"Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:"
Shakespeare,"'Tis he the common people love so much,"
Shakespeare,"Myself hath often over-heard them say,"
Shakespeare,"When I have walked like a private man,"
Shakespeare,"That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,"
Shakespeare,And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.
Shakespeare,Why should you fear? is not your city strong?
Shakespeare,"Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,"
Shakespeare,And will revolt from me to succor him.
Shakespeare,"King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name."
Shakespeare,"Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?"
Shakespeare,"The eagle suffers little birds to sing,"
Shakespeare,"And is not careful what they mean thereby,"
Shakespeare,Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
Shakespeare,He can at pleasure stint their melody:
Shakespeare,Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.
Shakespeare,"Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,"
Shakespeare,I will enchant the old Andronicus
Shakespeare,"With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,"
Shakespeare,"Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,"
Shakespeare,"When as the one is wounded with the bait,"
Shakespeare,The other rotted with delicious feed.
Shakespeare,But he will not entreat his son for us.
Shakespeare,"If Tamora entreat him, then he will:"
Shakespeare,For I can smooth and fill his aged ear
Shakespeare,"With golden promises, that, were his heart"
Shakespeare,"Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,"
Shakespeare,Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.
Shakespeare,To AEmilius
Shakespeare,"Go thou before, be our ambassador:"
Shakespeare,Say that the emperor requests a parley
Shakespeare,"Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting"
Shakespeare,"Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus."
Shakespeare,"AEmilius, do this message honourably:"
Shakespeare,"And if he stand on hostage for his safety,"
Shakespeare,Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.
Shakespeare,Your bidding shall I do effectually.
Shakespeare,"Now will I to that old Andronicus,"
Shakespeare,"And temper him with all the art I have,"
Shakespeare,To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.
Shakespeare,"And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,"
Shakespeare,And bury all thy fear in my devices.
Shakespeare,"Then go successantly, and plead to him."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Plains near Rome.
Shakespeare,"Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths, with drum and colours"
Shakespeare,"Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,"
Shakespeare,"I have received letters from great Rome,"
Shakespeare,Which signify what hate they bear their emperor
Shakespeare,And how desirous of our sight they are.
Shakespeare,"Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,"
Shakespeare,"Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,"
Shakespeare,"And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,"
Shakespeare,Let him make treble satisfaction.
Shakespeare,"Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,"
Shakespeare,"Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort,"
Shakespeare,Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
Shakespeare,"Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,"
Shakespeare,"Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,"
Shakespeare,Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day
Shakespeare,"Led by their master to the flowered fields,"
Shakespeare,And be avenged on cursed Tamora.
Shakespeare,"And as he saith, so say we all with him."
Shakespeare,"I humbly thank him, and I thank you all."
Shakespeare,"But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?"
Shakespeare,"Enter a Goth, leading AARON with his Child in his arms"
Shakespeare,"Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd"
Shakespeare,"To gaze upon a ruinous monastery,"
Shakespeare,"And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye"
Shakespeare,"Upon the wasted building, suddenly"
Shakespeare,I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
Shakespeare,"I made unto the noise, when soon I heard"
Shakespeare,The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:
Shakespeare,"'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!"
Shakespeare,"Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,"
Shakespeare,"Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,"
Shakespeare,"Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:"
Shakespeare,"But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,"
Shakespeare,They never do beget a coal-black calf.
Shakespeare,"Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates"
Shakespeare,"the babe,--"
Shakespeare,"'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth,"
Shakespeare,"Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,"
Shakespeare,Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'
Shakespeare,"With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,"
Shakespeare,"Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,"
Shakespeare,To use as you think needful of the man.
Shakespeare,"O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil"
Shakespeare,"That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand,"
Shakespeare,"This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,"
Shakespeare,And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.
Shakespeare,"Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey"
Shakespeare,This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
Shakespeare,"Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?"
Shakespeare,"A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree."
Shakespeare,And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
Shakespeare,"Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood."
Shakespeare,Too like the sire for ever being good.
Shakespeare,"First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl,"
Shakespeare,A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
Shakespeare,Get me a ladder.
Shakespeare,"A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend"
Shakespeare,"Lucius, save the child,"
Shakespeare,And bear it from me to the empress.
Shakespeare,"If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,"
Shakespeare,That highly may advantage thee to hear:
Shakespeare,"If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,"
Shakespeare,I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'
Shakespeare,Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st
Shakespeare,"Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd."
Shakespeare,"An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,"
Shakespeare,"'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak,"
Shakespeare,"For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,"
Shakespeare,"Acts of black night, abominable deeds,"
Shakespeare,"Complots of mischief, treason, villanies"
Shakespeare,"Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:"
Shakespeare,"And this shall all be buried by my death,"
Shakespeare,Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
Shakespeare,"Tell on thy mind, I say thy child shall live."
Shakespeare,"Swear that he shall, and then I will begin."
Shakespeare,Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:
Shakespeare,"That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?"
Shakespeare,"What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not,"
Shakespeare,"Yet, for I know thou art religious"
Shakespeare,"And hast a thing within thee called conscience,"
Shakespeare,"With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,"
Shakespeare,"Which I have seen thee careful to observe,"
Shakespeare,"Therefore I urge thy oath, for that I know"
Shakespeare,An idiot holds his bauble for a god
Shakespeare,"And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,"
Shakespeare,To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
Shakespeare,"By that same god, what god soe'er it be,"
Shakespeare,"That thou adorest and hast in reverence,"
Shakespeare,"To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up,"
Shakespeare,Or else I will discover nought to thee.
Shakespeare,Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
Shakespeare,"First know thou, I begot him on the empress."
Shakespeare,O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
Shakespeare,"Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity"
Shakespeare,To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
Shakespeare,"'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus,"
Shakespeare,They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
Shakespeare,And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.
Shakespeare,O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?
Shakespeare,"Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas"
Shakespeare,Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.
Shakespeare,"O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!"
Shakespeare,"Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:"
Shakespeare,"That codding spirit had they from their mother,"
Shakespeare,"As sure a card as ever won the set,"
Shakespeare,"That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,"
Shakespeare,As true a dog as ever fought at head.
Shakespeare,"Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth."
Shakespeare,I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
Shakespeare,Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:
Shakespeare,I wrote the letter that thy father found
Shakespeare,"And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,"
Shakespeare,Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
Shakespeare,"And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,"
Shakespeare,Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
Shakespeare,"I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,"
Shakespeare,"And, when I had it, drew myself apart"
Shakespeare,And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:
Shakespeare,I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
Shakespeare,"When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads,"
Shakespeare,"Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,"
Shakespeare,That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :
Shakespeare,"And when I told the empress of this sport,"
Shakespeare,"She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,"
Shakespeare,And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
Shakespeare,"What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is."
Shakespeare,Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
Shakespeare,"Ay, that I had not done a thousand more."
Shakespeare,"Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,"
Shakespeare,"Few come within the compass of my curse,--"
Shakespeare,"Wherein I did not some notorious ill,"
Shakespeare,"As kill a man, or else devise his death,"
Shakespeare,"Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,"
Shakespeare,"Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,"
Shakespeare,"Set deadly enmity between two friends,"
Shakespeare,"Make poor men's cattle break their necks,"
Shakespeare,"Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,"
Shakespeare,And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
Shakespeare,"Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,"
Shakespeare,"And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,"
Shakespeare,"Even when their sorrows almost were forgot,"
Shakespeare,"And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,"
Shakespeare,"Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,"
Shakespeare,"'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'"
Shakespeare,"Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things"
Shakespeare,"As willingly as one would kill a fly,"
Shakespeare,And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
Shakespeare,But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
Shakespeare,"Bring down the devil, for he must not die"
Shakespeare,So sweet a death as hanging presently.
Shakespeare,"If there be devils, would I were a devil,"
Shakespeare,"To live and burn in everlasting fire,"
Shakespeare,"So I might have your company in hell,"
Shakespeare,But to torment you with my bitter tongue!
Shakespeare,"Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more."
Shakespeare,Enter a Goth
Shakespeare,"My lord, there is a messenger from Rome"
Shakespeare,Desires to be admitted to your presence.
Shakespeare,Let him come near.
Shakespeare,"Welcome, AEmilius	what's the news from Rome?"
Shakespeare,"Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,"
Shakespeare,"The Roman emperor greets you all by me,"
Shakespeare,"And, for he understands you are in arms,"
Shakespeare,"He craves a parley at your father's house,"
Shakespeare,"Willing you to demand your hostages,"
Shakespeare,And they shall be immediately deliver'd.
Shakespeare,What says our general?
Shakespeare,"AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledges"
Shakespeare,"Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,"
Shakespeare,And we will come. March away.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. Rome. Before TITUS's house.
Shakespeare,"Enter TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON, disguised"
Shakespeare,"Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,"
Shakespeare,"I will encounter with Andronicus,"
Shakespeare,"And say I am Revenge, sent from below"
Shakespeare,To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
Shakespeare,"Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,"
Shakespeare,"To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge,"
Shakespeare,"Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,"
Shakespeare,And work confusion on his enemies.
Shakespeare,They knock
Shakespeare,"Enter TITUS, above"
Shakespeare,Who doth molest my contemplation?
Shakespeare,"Is it your trick to make me ope the door,"
Shakespeare,"That so my sad decrees may fly away,"
Shakespeare,And all my study be to no effect?
Shakespeare,You are deceived: for what I mean to do
Shakespeare,"See here in bloody lines I have set down,"
Shakespeare,And what is written shall be executed.
Shakespeare,"Titus, I am come to talk with thee."
Shakespeare,"No, not a word, how can I grace my talk,"
Shakespeare,Wanting a hand to give it action?
Shakespeare,"Thou hast the odds of me, therefore no more."
Shakespeare,"If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with me."
Shakespeare,"I am not mad, I know thee well enough:"
Shakespeare,"Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines,"
Shakespeare,"Witness these trenches made by grief and care,"
Shakespeare,"Witness the tiring day and heavy night,"
Shakespeare,"Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well"
Shakespeare,"For our proud empress, mighty Tamora:"
Shakespeare,Is not thy coming for my other hand?
Shakespeare,"Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora,"
Shakespeare,"She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:"
Shakespeare,"I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom,"
Shakespeare,"To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,"
Shakespeare,By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.
Shakespeare,"Come down, and welcome me to this world's light,"
Shakespeare,Confer with me of murder and of death:
Shakespeare,"There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,"
Shakespeare,"No vast obscurity or misty vale,"
Shakespeare,Where bloody murder or detested rape
Shakespeare,"Can couch for fear, but I will find them out,"
Shakespeare,"And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,"
Shakespeare,"Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake."
Shakespeare,"Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,"
Shakespeare,To be a torment to mine enemies?
Shakespeare,"I am, therefore come down, and welcome me."
Shakespeare,"Do me some service, ere I come to thee."
Shakespeare,"Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands,"
Shakespeare,"Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge,"
Shakespeare,"Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels,"
Shakespeare,"And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,"
Shakespeare,And whirl along with thee about the globe.
Shakespeare,"Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,"
Shakespeare,"To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,"
Shakespeare,And find out murderers in their guilty caves:
Shakespeare,"And when thy car is loaden with their heads,"
Shakespeare,"I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel"
Shakespeare,"Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,"
Shakespeare,Even from Hyperion's rising in the east
Shakespeare,Until his very downfall in the sea:
Shakespeare,"And day by day I'll do this heavy task,"
Shakespeare,So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
Shakespeare,"These are my ministers, and come with me."
Shakespeare,Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?
Shakespeare,"Rapine and Murder, therefore called so,"
Shakespeare,Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
Shakespeare,"Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!"
Shakespeare,"And you, the empress! but we worldly men"
Shakespeare,"Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes."
Shakespeare,"O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee,"
Shakespeare,"And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,"
Shakespeare,I will embrace thee in it by and by.
Shakespeare,This closing with him fits his lunacy
Shakespeare,"Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,"
Shakespeare,"Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,"
Shakespeare,"For now he firmly takes me for Revenge,"
Shakespeare,"And, being credulous in this mad thought,"
Shakespeare,"I'll make him send for Lucius his son,"
Shakespeare,"And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,"
Shakespeare,"I'll find some cunning practise out of hand,"
Shakespeare,"To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,"
Shakespeare,"Or, at the least, make them his enemies."
Shakespeare,"See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme."
Shakespeare,Enter TITUS below
Shakespeare,"Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee:"
Shakespeare,"Welcome, dread Fury, to my woful house:"
Shakespeare,"Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too."
Shakespeare,How like the empress and her sons you are!
Shakespeare,"Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor:"
Shakespeare,Could not all hell afford you such a devil?
Shakespeare,For well I wot the empress never wags
Shakespeare,"But in her company there is a Moor,"
Shakespeare,"And, would you represent our queen aright,"
Shakespeare,It were convenient you had such a devil:
Shakespeare,"But welcome, as you are. What shall we do?"
Shakespeare,"What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?"
Shakespeare,"Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him."
Shakespeare,"Show me a villain that hath done a rape,"
Shakespeare,And I am sent to be revenged on him.
Shakespeare,"Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,"
Shakespeare,And I will be revenged on them all.
Shakespeare,"Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,"
Shakespeare,And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself.
Shakespeare,"Good Murder, stab him, he's a murderer."
Shakespeare,"Go thou with him, and when it is thy hap"
Shakespeare,"To find another that is like to thee,"
Shakespeare,"Good Rapine, stab him, he's a ravisher."
Shakespeare,"Go thou with them, and in the emperor's court"
Shakespeare,"There is a queen, attended by a Moor,"
Shakespeare,"Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,"
Shakespeare,for up and down she doth resemble thee:
Shakespeare,"I pray thee, do on them some violent death,"
Shakespeare,They have been violent to me and mine.
Shakespeare,"Well hast thou lesson'd us, this shall we do."
Shakespeare,"But would it please thee, good Andronicus,"
Shakespeare,"To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,"
Shakespeare,"Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,"
Shakespeare,"And bid him come and banquet at thy house,"
Shakespeare,"When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,"
Shakespeare,"I will bring in the empress and her sons,"
Shakespeare,"The emperor himself and all thy foes,"
Shakespeare,"And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,"
Shakespeare,And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.
Shakespeare,What says Andronicus to this device?
Shakespeare,"Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls."
Shakespeare,"Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius,"
Shakespeare,Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:
Shakespeare,"Bid him repair to me, and bring with him"
Shakespeare,"Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths,"
Shakespeare,Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:
Shakespeare,Tell him the emperor and the empress too
Shakespeare,"Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them."
Shakespeare,"This do thou for my love, and so let him,"
Shakespeare,As he regards his aged father's life.
Shakespeare,"This will I do, and soon return again."
Shakespeare,"Now will I hence about thy business,"
Shakespeare,And take my ministers along with me.
Shakespeare,"Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,"
Shakespeare,"Or else I'll call my brother back again,"
Shakespeare,And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.
Shakespeare,"[Aside to her sons]  What say you, boys? will you"
Shakespeare,"bide with him,"
Shakespeare,Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor
Shakespeare,How I have govern'd our determined jest?
Shakespeare,"Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,"
Shakespeare,And tarry with him till I turn again.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  I know them all, though they suppose me mad,"
Shakespeare,And will o'erreach them in their own devices:
Shakespeare,A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!
Shakespeare,"Madam, depart at pleasure, leave us here."
Shakespeare,"Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes"
Shakespeare,To lay a complot to betray thy foes.
Shakespeare,"I know thou dost, and, sweet Revenge, farewell."
Shakespeare,Exit TAMORA
Shakespeare,"Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?"
Shakespeare,"Tut, I have work enough for you to do."
Shakespeare,"Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!"
Shakespeare,Enter PUBLIUS and others
Shakespeare,Know you these two?
Shakespeare,"The empress' sons, I take them, Chiron and Demetrius."
Shakespeare,"Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceived,"
Shakespeare,"The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name,"
Shakespeare,"And therefore bind them, gentle Publius."
Shakespeare,"Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them."
Shakespeare,"Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,"
Shakespeare,"And now I find it, therefore bind them sure,"
Shakespeare,"And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry."
Shakespeare,"PUBLIUS,  and c. lay hold on CHIRON and DEMETRIUS"
Shakespeare,"Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons."
Shakespeare,And therefore do we what we are commanded.
Shakespeare,"Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word."
Shakespeare,Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter TITUS, with LAVINIA, he bearing a knife, and she a basin"
Shakespeare,"Come, come, Lavinia, look, thy foes are bound."
Shakespeare,"Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me,"
Shakespeare,But let them hear what fearful words I utter.
Shakespeare,"O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!"
Shakespeare,"Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,"
Shakespeare,This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.
Shakespeare,"You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault"
Shakespeare,"Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,"
Shakespeare,"My hand cut off and made a merry jest,"
Shakespeare,"Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear"
Shakespeare,"Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,"
Shakespeare,"Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forced."
Shakespeare,"What would you say, if I should let you speak?"
Shakespeare,"Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace."
Shakespeare,"Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you."
Shakespeare,"This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,"
Shakespeare,Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
Shakespeare,The basin that receives your guilty blood.
Shakespeare,"You know your mother means to feast with me,"
Shakespeare,"And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:"
Shakespeare,"Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust"
Shakespeare,"And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,"
Shakespeare,And of the paste a coffin I will rear
Shakespeare,"And make two pasties of your shameful heads,"
Shakespeare,"And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,"
Shakespeare,Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
Shakespeare,"This is the feast that I have bid her to,"
Shakespeare,"And this the banquet she shall surfeit on,"
Shakespeare,"For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,"
Shakespeare,And worse than Progne I will be revenged:
Shakespeare,"And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,"
Shakespeare,He cuts their throats
Shakespeare,"Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,"
Shakespeare,Let me go grind their bones to powder small
Shakespeare,"And with this hateful liquor temper it,"
Shakespeare,And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.
Shakespeare,"Come, come, be every one officious"
Shakespeare,"To make this banquet, which I wish may prove"
Shakespeare,More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
Shakespeare,"So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook,"
Shakespeare,And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt, bearing the dead bodies"
Shakespeare,SCENE III. Court of TITUS's house. A banquet set out.
Shakespeare,"Enter LUCIUS, MARCUS, and Goths, with AARON prisoner"
Shakespeare,"Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind"
Shakespeare,"That I repair to Rome, I am content."
Shakespeare,"And ours with thine, befall what fortune will."
Shakespeare,"Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,"
Shakespeare,"This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil,"
Shakespeare,"Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him"
Shakespeare,"Till he be brought unto the empress' face,"
Shakespeare,For testimony of her foul proceedings:
Shakespeare,"And see the ambush of our friends be strong,"
Shakespeare,I fear the emperor means no good to us.
Shakespeare,"Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,"
Shakespeare,"And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth"
Shakespeare,The venomous malice of my swelling heart!
Shakespeare,"Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!"
Shakespeare,"Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in."
Shakespeare,"Exeunt Goths, with AARON. Flourish within"
Shakespeare,The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.
Shakespeare,"Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA, with AEMILIUS, Tribunes, Senators, and others"
Shakespeare,"What, hath the firmament more suns than one?"
Shakespeare,What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?
Shakespeare,"Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle,"
Shakespeare,These quarrels must be quietly debated.
Shakespeare,"The feast is ready, which the careful Titus"
Shakespeare,"Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,"
Shakespeare,"For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:"
Shakespeare,"Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places."
Shakespeare,"Marcus, we will."
Shakespeare,Hautboys sound. The Company sit down at table
Shakespeare,"Enter TITUS dressed like a Cook, LAVINIA veiled,  Young LUCIUS, and others. TITUS places the dishes on the table"
Shakespeare,"Welcome, my gracious lord, welcome, dread queen,"
Shakespeare,"Welcome, ye warlike Goths, welcome, Lucius,"
Shakespeare,"And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,"
Shakespeare,"'Twill fill your stomachs, please you eat of it."
Shakespeare,"Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?"
Shakespeare,"Because I would be sure to have all well,"
Shakespeare,To entertain your highness and your empress.
Shakespeare,"We are beholding to you, good Andronicus."
Shakespeare,"An if your highness knew my heart, you were."
Shakespeare,"My lord the emperor, resolve me this:"
Shakespeare,Was it well done of rash Virginius
Shakespeare,"To slay his daughter with his own right hand,"
Shakespeare,"Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?"
Shakespeare,"It was, Andronicus."
Shakespeare,"Your reason, mighty lord?"
Shakespeare,"Because the girl should not survive her shame,"
Shakespeare,And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
Shakespeare,"A reason mighty, strong, and effectual,"
Shakespeare,"A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,"
Shakespeare,"For me, most wretched, to perform the like."
Shakespeare,"Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee,"
Shakespeare,Kills LAVINIA
Shakespeare,"And, with thy shame, thy father's sorrow die!"
Shakespeare,"What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?"
Shakespeare,"Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind."
Shakespeare,"I am as woful as Virginius was,"
Shakespeare,And have a thousand times more cause than he
Shakespeare,To do this outrage: and it now is done.
Shakespeare,"What, was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed."
Shakespeare,Will't please you eat? will't please your
Shakespeare,highness feed?
Shakespeare,Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
Shakespeare,"Not I, 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:"
Shakespeare,"They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue,"
Shakespeare,"And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong."
Shakespeare,Go fetch them hither to us presently.
Shakespeare,"Why, there they are both, baked in that pie,"
Shakespeare,"Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,"
Shakespeare,Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
Shakespeare,"'Tis true, 'tis true, witness my knife's sharp point."
Shakespeare,Kills TAMORA
Shakespeare,"Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!"
Shakespeare,Kills TITUS
Shakespeare,Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
Shakespeare,"There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!"
Shakespeare,"Kills SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS, MARCUS, and others go up into the balcony"
Shakespeare,"You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,"
Shakespeare,"By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl"
Shakespeare,"Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,"
Shakespeare,"O, let me teach you how to knit again"
Shakespeare,"This scatter'd corn  into one mutual sheaf,"
Shakespeare,"These broken limbs again into one body,"
Shakespeare,"Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,"
Shakespeare,"And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,"
Shakespeare,"Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,"
Shakespeare,Do shameful execution on herself.
Shakespeare,"But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,"
Shakespeare,"Grave witnesses of true experience,"
Shakespeare,"Cannot induce you to attend my words,"
Shakespeare,"Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,"
Shakespeare,When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
Shakespeare,To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
Shakespeare,The story of that baleful burning night
Shakespeare,"When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,"
Shakespeare,"Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,"
Shakespeare,Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
Shakespeare,"That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound."
Shakespeare,"My heart is not compact of flint nor steel,"
Shakespeare,"Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,"
Shakespeare,"But floods of tears will drown my oratory,"
Shakespeare,"And break my utterance, even in the time"
Shakespeare,"When it should move you to attend me most,"
Shakespeare,Lending your kind commiseration.
Shakespeare,"Here is a captain, let him tell the tale,"
Shakespeare,Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
Shakespeare,"Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,"
Shakespeare,That cursed Chiron and Demetrius
Shakespeare,"Were they that murdered our emperor's brother,"
Shakespeare,And they it were that ravished our sister:
Shakespeare,"For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,"
Shakespeare,"Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd"
Shakespeare,"Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,"
Shakespeare,And sent her enemies unto the grave.
Shakespeare,"Lastly, myself unkindly banished,"
Shakespeare,"The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,"
Shakespeare,To beg relief among Rome's enemies:
Shakespeare,Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.
Shakespeare,And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.
Shakespeare,"I am the turned forth, be it known to you,"
Shakespeare,"That have preserved her welfare in my blood,"
Shakespeare,"And from her bosom took the enemy's point,"
Shakespeare,Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.
Shakespeare,"Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I,"
Shakespeare,"My scars can witness, dumb although they are,"
Shakespeare,That my report is just and full of truth.
Shakespeare,"But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,"
Shakespeare,"Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me,"
Shakespeare,"For when no friends are by, men praise themselves."
Shakespeare,Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:
Shakespeare,Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant
Shakespeare,"Of this was Tamora delivered,"
Shakespeare,"The issue of an irreligious Moor,"
Shakespeare,Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
Shakespeare,"The villain is alive in Titus' house,"
Shakespeare,"And as he is, to witness this is true."
Shakespeare,Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
Shakespeare,"These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,"
Shakespeare,Or more than any living man could bear.
Shakespeare,"Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?"
Shakespeare,"Have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein,"
Shakespeare,"And, from the place where you behold us now,"
Shakespeare,The poor remainder of Andronici
Shakespeare,"Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down."
Shakespeare,"And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,"
Shakespeare,And make a mutual closure of our house.
Shakespeare,"Speak, Romans, speak, and if you say we shall,"
Shakespeare,"Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall."
Shakespeare,"Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,"
Shakespeare,"And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,"
Shakespeare,"Lucius our emperor, for well I know"
Shakespeare,The common voice do cry it shall be so.
Shakespeare,"Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!"
Shakespeare,"Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,"
Shakespeare,To Attendants
Shakespeare,"And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,"
Shakespeare,"To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,"
Shakespeare,As punishment for his most wicked life.
Shakespeare,"LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend"
Shakespeare,"Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!"
Shakespeare,"Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,"
Shakespeare,"To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!"
Shakespeare,"But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,"
Shakespeare,For nature puts me to a heavy task:
Shakespeare,"Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,"
Shakespeare,To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
Shakespeare,"O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,"
Shakespeare,Kissing TITUS
Shakespeare,"These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,"
Shakespeare,The last true duties of thy noble son!
Shakespeare,"Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,"
Shakespeare,Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
Shakespeare,O were the sum of these that I should pay
Shakespeare,"Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!"
Shakespeare,"Come hither, boy, come, come, and learn of us"
Shakespeare,To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:
Shakespeare,"Many a time he danced thee on his knee,"
Shakespeare,"Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:"
Shakespeare,"Many a matter hath he told to thee,"
Shakespeare,"Meet and agreeing with thine infancy,"
Shakespeare,"In that respect, then, like a loving child,"
Shakespeare,"Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,"
Shakespeare,Because kind nature doth require it so:
Shakespeare,Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:
Shakespeare,"Bid him farewell, commit him to the grave,"
Shakespeare,"Do him that kindness, and take leave of him."
Shakespeare,"O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart"
Shakespeare,"Would I were dead, so you did live again!"
Shakespeare,"O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping,"
Shakespeare,"My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth."
Shakespeare,Re-enter Attendants with AARON
Shakespeare,"You sad Andronici, have done with woes:"
Shakespeare,"Give sentence on this execrable wretch,"
Shakespeare,That hath been breeder of these dire events.
Shakespeare,"Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him,"
Shakespeare,"There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food,"
Shakespeare,"If any one relieves or pities him,"
Shakespeare,For the offence he dies. This is our doom:
Shakespeare,Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.
Shakespeare,"O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?"
Shakespeare,"I am no baby, I, that with base prayers"
Shakespeare,I should repent the evils I have done:
Shakespeare,Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
Shakespeare,"Would I perform, if I might have my will,"
Shakespeare,"If one good deed in all my life I did,"
Shakespeare,I do repent it from my very soul.
Shakespeare,"Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,"
Shakespeare,And give him burial in his father's grave:
Shakespeare,My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
Shakespeare,Be closed in our household's monument.
Shakespeare,"As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,"
Shakespeare,"No funeral rite, nor man m mourning weeds,"
Shakespeare,"No mournful bell shall ring her burial,"
Shakespeare,But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:
Shakespeare,"Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity,"
Shakespeare,"And, being so, shall have like want of pity."
Shakespeare,"See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,"
Shakespeare,By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:
Shakespeare,"Then, afterwards, to order well the state,"
Shakespeare,That like events may ne'er it ruinate.
Shakespeare,"In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece"
Shakespeare,"The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,"
Shakespeare,"Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,"
Shakespeare,Fraught with the ministers and instruments
Shakespeare,"Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore"
Shakespeare,"Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay"
Shakespeare,"Put forth toward Phrygia, and their vow is made"
Shakespeare,"To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures"
Shakespeare,"The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,"
Shakespeare,"With wanton Paris sleeps, and that's the quarrel."
Shakespeare,"To Tenedos they come,"
Shakespeare,And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
Shakespeare,Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
Shakespeare,The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
Shakespeare,"Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,"
Shakespeare,"Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,"
Shakespeare,"And Antenorides, with massy staples"
Shakespeare,"And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,"
Shakespeare,Sperr up the sons of Troy.
Shakespeare,"Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,"
Shakespeare,"On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,"
Shakespeare,Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come
Shakespeare,"A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence"
Shakespeare,"Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited"
Shakespeare,"In like conditions as our argument,"
Shakespeare,"To tell you, fair beholders, that our play"
Shakespeare,"Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,"
Shakespeare,"Beginning in the middle, starting thence away"
Shakespeare,To what may be digested in a play.
Shakespeare,"Like or find fault, do as your pleasures are:"
Shakespeare,"Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Troy. Before Priam's palace.
Shakespeare,"Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS"
Shakespeare,"Call here my varlet, I'll unarm again:"
Shakespeare,"Why should I war without the walls of Troy,"
Shakespeare,That find such cruel battle here within?
Shakespeare,"Each Trojan that is master of his heart,"
Shakespeare,"Let him to field, Troilus, alas! hath none."
Shakespeare,Will this gear ne'er be mended?
Shakespeare,"The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,"
Shakespeare,"Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant,"
Shakespeare,"But I am weaker than a woman's tear,"
Shakespeare,"Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,"
Shakespeare,Less valiant than the virgin in the night
Shakespeare,And skilless as unpractised infancy.
Shakespeare,"Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,"
Shakespeare,I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will
Shakespeare,have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.
Shakespeare,Have I not tarried?
Shakespeare,Have I not tarried?
Shakespeare,"Ay, the grinding, but you must tarry"
Shakespeare,the bolting.
Shakespeare,"Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening."
Shakespeare,Still have I tarried.
Shakespeare,"Ay, to the leavening, but here's yet in the word"
Shakespeare,"'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the"
Shakespeare,"heating of the oven and the baking, nay, you must"
Shakespeare,"stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips."
Shakespeare,"Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,"
Shakespeare,Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.
Shakespeare,"At Priam's royal table do I sit,"
Shakespeare,"And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--"
Shakespeare,"So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?"
Shakespeare,"Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw"
Shakespeare,"her look, or any woman else."
Shakespeare,"I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,"
Shakespeare,"As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,"
Shakespeare,"Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,"
Shakespeare,"I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,"
Shakespeare,Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:
Shakespeare,"But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,"
Shakespeare,Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
Shakespeare,An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--
Shakespeare,"well, go to--there were no more comparison between"
Shakespeare,"the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman, I"
Shakespeare,"would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would"
Shakespeare,"somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I"
Shakespeare,"will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--"
Shakespeare,"O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--"
Shakespeare,"When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,"
Shakespeare,Reply not in how many fathoms deep
Shakespeare,They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
Shakespeare,"In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair,'"
Shakespeare,Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
Shakespeare,"Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,"
Shakespeare,"Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,"
Shakespeare,"In whose comparison all whites are ink,"
Shakespeare,"Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure"
Shakespeare,The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
Shakespeare,"Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,"
Shakespeare,"As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her,"
Shakespeare,"But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,"
Shakespeare,Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
Shakespeare,The knife that made it.
Shakespeare,I speak no more than truth.
Shakespeare,Thou dost not speak so much.
Shakespeare,"Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:"
Shakespeare,"if she be fair, 'tis the better for her, an she be"
Shakespeare,"not, she has the mends in her own hands."
Shakespeare,"Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!"
Shakespeare,"I have had my labour for my travail, ill-thought on of"
Shakespeare,"her and ill-thought on of you, gone between and"
Shakespeare,"between, but small thanks for my labour."
Shakespeare,"What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?"
Shakespeare,"Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair"
Shakespeare,"as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as"
Shakespeare,fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care
Shakespeare,"I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor, 'tis all one to me."
Shakespeare,Say I she is not fair?
Shakespeare,I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to
Shakespeare,"stay behind her father, let her to the Greeks, and so"
Shakespeare,"I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,"
Shakespeare,I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.
Shakespeare,"Pandarus,--"
Shakespeare,"Sweet Pandarus,--"
Shakespeare,"Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I"
Shakespeare,"found it, and there an end."
Shakespeare,Exit PANDARUS. An alarum
Shakespeare,"Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!"
Shakespeare,"Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,"
Shakespeare,When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
Shakespeare,"I cannot fight upon this argument,"
Shakespeare,It is too starved a subject for my sword.
Shakespeare,"But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!"
Shakespeare,"I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar,"
Shakespeare,And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.
Shakespeare,As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
Shakespeare,"Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,"
Shakespeare,"What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?"
Shakespeare,"Her bed is India, there she lies, a pearl:"
Shakespeare,"Between our Ilium and where she resides,"
Shakespeare,"Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,"
Shakespeare,"Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar"
Shakespeare,"Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark."
Shakespeare,Alarum. Enter AENEAS
Shakespeare,"How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?"
Shakespeare,"Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,"
Shakespeare,For womanish it is to be from thence.
Shakespeare,"What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?"
Shakespeare,That Paris is returned home and hurt.
Shakespeare,"By whom, AEneas?"
Shakespeare,"Troilus, by Menelaus."
Shakespeare,"Let Paris bleed, 'tis but a scar to scorn,"
Shakespeare,Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.
Shakespeare,"Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!"
Shakespeare,"Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'"
Shakespeare,But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?
Shakespeare,In all swift haste.
Shakespeare,"Come, go we then together."
Shakespeare,SCENE II. The Same. A street.
Shakespeare,Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER
Shakespeare,Who were those went by?
Shakespeare,Queen Hecuba and Helen.
Shakespeare,And whither go they?
Shakespeare,"Up to the eastern tower,"
Shakespeare,"Whose height commands as subject all the vale,"
Shakespeare,"To see the battle. Hector, whose patience"
Shakespeare,"Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:"
Shakespeare,"He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,"
Shakespeare,"And, like as there were husbandry in war,"
Shakespeare,"Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,"
Shakespeare,"And to the field goes he, where every flower"
Shakespeare,"Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw"
Shakespeare,In Hector's wrath.
Shakespeare,What was his cause of anger?
Shakespeare,"The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks"
Shakespeare,"A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector,"
Shakespeare,They call him Ajax.
Shakespeare,"Good, and what of him?"
Shakespeare,"They say he is a very man per se,"
Shakespeare,And stands alone.
Shakespeare,"So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs."
Shakespeare,"This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their"
Shakespeare,"particular additions, he is as valiant as the lion,"
Shakespeare,"churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man"
Shakespeare,into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
Shakespeare,"valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with"
Shakespeare,discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he
Shakespeare,"hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he"
Shakespeare,carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without
Shakespeare,"cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the"
Shakespeare,"joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint"
Shakespeare,"that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,"
Shakespeare,"or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight."
Shakespeare,"But how should this man, that makes"
Shakespeare,"me smile, make Hector angry?"
Shakespeare,They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and
Shakespeare,"struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath"
Shakespeare,ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.
Shakespeare,"Madam, your uncle Pandarus."
Shakespeare,Enter PANDARUS
Shakespeare,Enter PANDARUS
Shakespeare,Enter PANDARUS
Shakespeare,Hector's a gallant man.
Shakespeare,"As may be in the world, lady."
Shakespeare,What's that? what's that?
Shakespeare,"Good morrow, uncle Pandarus."
Shakespeare,"Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?"
Shakespeare,"Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When"
Shakespeare,were you at Ilium?
Shakespeare,"This morning, uncle."
Shakespeare,What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector
Shakespeare,armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not
Shakespeare,"up, was she?"
Shakespeare,"Hector was gone, but Helen was not up."
Shakespeare,Even so: Hector was stirring early.
Shakespeare,"That were we talking of, and of his anger."
Shakespeare,Was he angry?
Shakespeare,So he says here.
Shakespeare,"True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay"
Shakespeare,"about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's"
Shakespeare,Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take
Shakespeare,"heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too."
Shakespeare,"What, is he angry too?"
Shakespeare,"Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two."
Shakespeare,O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
Shakespeare,"What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a"
Shakespeare,man if you see him?
Shakespeare,"Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him."
Shakespeare,"Well, I say Troilus is Troilus."
Shakespeare,"Then you say as I say, for, I am sure, he is not Hector."
Shakespeare,"No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees."
Shakespeare,"'Tis just to each of them, he is himself."
Shakespeare,"Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were."
Shakespeare,So he is.
Shakespeare,"Condition, I had gone barefoot to India."
Shakespeare,He is not Hector.
Shakespeare,"Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were"
Shakespeare,"himself! Well, the gods are above, time must friend"
Shakespeare,"or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were"
Shakespeare,"in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus."
Shakespeare,Excuse me.
Shakespeare,He is elder.
Shakespeare,"Pardon me, pardon me."
Shakespeare,"Th' other's not come to't, you shall tell me another"
Shakespeare,"tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not"
Shakespeare,have his wit this year.
Shakespeare,"He shall not need it, if he have his own."
Shakespeare,Nor his qualities.
Shakespeare,No matter.
Shakespeare,Nor his beauty.
Shakespeare,"'Twould not become him, his own's better."
Shakespeare,"You have no judgment, niece: Helen"
Shakespeare,"herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for"
Shakespeare,"a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--"
Shakespeare,"not brown neither,--"
Shakespeare,"No, but brown."
Shakespeare,"'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown."
Shakespeare,"To say the truth, true and not true."
Shakespeare,She praised his complexion above Paris.
Shakespeare,"Why, Paris hath colour enough."
Shakespeare,So he has.
Shakespeare,Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
Shakespeare,"him above, his complexion is higher than his, he"
Shakespeare,"having colour enough, and the other higher, is too"
Shakespeare,flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as
Shakespeare,lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for
Shakespeare,a copper nose.
Shakespeare,I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
Shakespeare,Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
Shakespeare,"Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other"
Shakespeare,"day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he"
Shakespeare,"has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--"
Shakespeare,"Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his"
Shakespeare,particulars therein to a total.
Shakespeare,"Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within"
Shakespeare,"three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector."
Shakespeare,Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
Shakespeare,But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came
Shakespeare,and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--
Shakespeare,Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
Shakespeare,"Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling"
Shakespeare,becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.
Shakespeare,"O, he smiles valiantly."
Shakespeare,Does he not?
Shakespeare,"O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn."
Shakespeare,"Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen"
Shakespeare,"loves Troilus,--"
Shakespeare,"Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll"
Shakespeare,prove it so.
Shakespeare,"Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem"
Shakespeare,an addle egg.
Shakespeare,If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
Shakespeare,"head, you would eat chickens i' the shell."
Shakespeare,"I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled"
Shakespeare,"his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I"
Shakespeare,"must needs confess,--"
Shakespeare,Without the rack.
Shakespeare,And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
Shakespeare,"Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer."
Shakespeare,But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed
Shakespeare,that her eyes ran o'er.
Shakespeare,With mill-stones.
Shakespeare,And Cassandra laughed.
Shakespeare,But there was more temperate fire under the pot of
Shakespeare,her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?
Shakespeare,And Hector laughed.
Shakespeare,At what was all this laughing?
Shakespeare,"Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin."
Shakespeare,"An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed"
Shakespeare,too.
Shakespeare,They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.
Shakespeare,What was his answer?
Shakespeare,"Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your"
Shakespeare,"chin, and one of them is white."
Shakespeare,This is her question.
Shakespeare,"That's true, make no question of that. 'Two and"
Shakespeare,"fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white"
Shakespeare,"hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'"
Shakespeare,"'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,"
Shakespeare,"my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't"
Shakespeare,"out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!"
Shakespeare,"and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the"
Shakespeare,"rest so laughed, that it passed."
Shakespeare,"So let it now, for it has been while going by."
Shakespeare,"Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday, think on't."
Shakespeare,So I do.
Shakespeare,"I'll be sworn 'tis true, he will weep you, an 'twere"
Shakespeare,a man born in April.
Shakespeare,"And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle"
Shakespeare,against May.
Shakespeare,A retreat sounded
Shakespeare,A retreat sounded
Shakespeare,A retreat sounded
Shakespeare,Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we
Shakespeare,"stand up here, and see them as they pass toward"
Shakespeare,"Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida."
Shakespeare,At your pleasure.
Shakespeare,"Here, here, here's an excellent place, here we may"
Shakespeare,see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their
Shakespeare,"names as they pass by, but mark Troilus above the rest."
Shakespeare,Speak not so loud.
Shakespeare,AENEAS passes
Shakespeare,That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of
Shakespeare,"the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark"
Shakespeare,"Troilus, you shall see anon."
Shakespeare,ANTENOR passes
Shakespeare,Who's that?
Shakespeare,Who's that?
Shakespeare,"That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you,"
Shakespeare,"and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest"
Shakespeare,"judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person."
Shakespeare,When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if
Shakespeare,"he see me, you shall see him nod at me."
Shakespeare,Will he give you the nod?
Shakespeare,You shall see.
Shakespeare,"If he do, the rich shall have more."
Shakespeare,HECTOR passes
Shakespeare,"That's Hector, that, that, look you, that, there's a"
Shakespeare,"fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,"
Shakespeare,niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
Shakespeare,a countenance! is't not a brave man?
Shakespeare,"O, a brave man!"
Shakespeare,Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you
Shakespeare,"what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do"
Shakespeare,"you see? look you there: there's no jesting,"
Shakespeare,"there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:"
Shakespeare,there be hacks!
Shakespeare,Be those with swords?
Shakespeare,"Swords! any thing, he cares not, an the devil come"
Shakespeare,"to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's"
Shakespeare,"heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris."
Shakespeare,PARIS passes
Shakespeare,"Look ye yonder, niece, is't not a gallant man too,"
Shakespeare,"is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came"
Shakespeare,"hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do"
Shakespeare,"Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see"
Shakespeare,Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
Shakespeare,HELENUS passes
Shakespeare,That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
Shakespeare,Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.
Shakespeare,"Can Helenus fight, uncle?"
Shakespeare,"Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I"
Shakespeare,marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the
Shakespeare,people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.
Shakespeare,What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
Shakespeare,TROILUS passes
Shakespeare,Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!
Shakespeare,"there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the"
Shakespeare,prince of chivalry!
Shakespeare,"Peace, for shame, peace!"
Shakespeare,"Mark him, note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon"
Shakespeare,"him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and"
Shakespeare,"his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,"
Shakespeare,and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw
Shakespeare,"three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!"
Shakespeare,"Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,"
Shakespeare,he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?
Shakespeare,"Paris is dirt to him, and, I warrant, Helen, to"
Shakespeare,"change, would give an eye to boot."
Shakespeare,Here come more.
Shakespeare,Forces pass
Shakespeare,"Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!"
Shakespeare,porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the
Shakespeare,"eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles"
Shakespeare,"are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had"
Shakespeare,rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and
Shakespeare,all Greece.
Shakespeare,"There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus."
Shakespeare,"Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel."
Shakespeare,"Well, well."
Shakespeare,"'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have"
Shakespeare,you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not
Shakespeare,"birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,"
Shakespeare,"learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,"
Shakespeare,"and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date"
Shakespeare,"in the pie, for then the man's date's out."
Shakespeare,You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you
Shakespeare,lie.
Shakespeare,"Upon my back, to defend my belly, upon my wit, to"
Shakespeare,"defend my wiles, upon my secrecy, to defend mine"
Shakespeare,"honesty, my mask, to defend my beauty, and you, to"
Shakespeare,"defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a"
Shakespeare,thousand watches.
Shakespeare,Say one of your watches.
Shakespeare,"Nay, I'll watch you for that, and that's one of the"
Shakespeare,chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would
Shakespeare,"not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took"
Shakespeare,"the blow, unless it swell past hiding, and then it's"
Shakespeare,past watching.
Shakespeare,You are such another!
Shakespeare,Enter Troilus's Boy
Shakespeare,"Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you."
Shakespeare,"At your own house, there he unarms him."
Shakespeare,"Good boy, tell him I come."
Shakespeare,Exit boy
Shakespeare,"I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece."
Shakespeare,"Adieu, uncle."
Shakespeare,"I'll be with you, niece, by and by."
Shakespeare,"To bring, uncle?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, a token from Troilus."
Shakespeare,"By the same token, you are a bawd."
Shakespeare,Exit PANDARUS
Shakespeare,"Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,"
Shakespeare,"He offers in another's enterprise,"
Shakespeare,But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
Shakespeare,"Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be,"
Shakespeare,"Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:"
Shakespeare,"Things won are done, joy's soul lies in the doing."
Shakespeare,That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
Shakespeare,Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:
Shakespeare,That she was never yet that ever knew
Shakespeare,Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
Shakespeare,Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
Shakespeare,"Achievement is command, ungain'd, beseech:"
Shakespeare,"Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,"
Shakespeare,Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
Shakespeare,SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.
Shakespeare,"Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES, MENELAUS, and others"
Shakespeare,"Princes,"
Shakespeare,What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
Shakespeare,The ample proposition that hope makes
Shakespeare,In all designs begun on earth below
Shakespeare,Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters
Shakespeare,"Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,"
Shakespeare,"As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,"
Shakespeare,Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
Shakespeare,Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
Shakespeare,"Nor, princes, is it matter new to us"
Shakespeare,That we come short of our suppose so far
Shakespeare,"That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand,"
Shakespeare,"Sith every action that hath gone before,"
Shakespeare,"Whereof we have record, trial did draw"
Shakespeare,"Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,"
Shakespeare,And that unbodied figure of the thought
Shakespeare,"That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,"
Shakespeare,"Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,"
Shakespeare,And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
Shakespeare,But the protractive trials of great Jove
Shakespeare,To find persistive constancy in men:
Shakespeare,The fineness of which metal is not found
Shakespeare,"In fortune's love, for then the bold and coward,"
Shakespeare,"The wise and fool, the artist and unread,"
Shakespeare,The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:
Shakespeare,"But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,"
Shakespeare,"Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,"
Shakespeare,"Puffing at all, winnows the light away,"
Shakespeare,"And what hath mass or matter, by itself"
Shakespeare,Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
Shakespeare,"With due observance of thy godlike seat,"
Shakespeare,"Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply"
Shakespeare,Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
Shakespeare,"Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,"
Shakespeare,How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
Shakespeare,"Upon her patient breast, making their way"
Shakespeare,With those of nobler bulk!
Shakespeare,But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
Shakespeare,"The gentle Thetis, and anon behold"
Shakespeare,"The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,"
Shakespeare,"Bounding between the two moist elements,"
Shakespeare,Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
Shakespeare,Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
Shakespeare,"Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,"
Shakespeare,Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
Shakespeare,Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
Shakespeare,"In storms of fortune, for in her ray and brightness"
Shakespeare,The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
Shakespeare,"Than by the tiger, but when the splitting wind"
Shakespeare,"Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,"
Shakespeare,"And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage"
Shakespeare,"As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,"
Shakespeare,And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
Shakespeare,Retorts to chiding fortune.
Shakespeare,"Agamemnon,"
Shakespeare,"Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,"
Shakespeare,"Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit."
Shakespeare,In whom the tempers and the minds of all
Shakespeare,"Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks."
Shakespeare,"Besides the applause and approbation To which,"
Shakespeare,To AGAMEMNON
Shakespeare,"most mighty for thy place and sway,"
Shakespeare,To NESTOR
Shakespeare,And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life
Shakespeare,"I give to both your speeches, which were such"
Shakespeare,As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
Shakespeare,"Should hold up high in brass, and such again"
Shakespeare,"As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,"
Shakespeare,"Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree"
Shakespeare,"On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears"
Shakespeare,"To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,"
Shakespeare,"Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak."
Shakespeare,"Speak, prince of Ithaca, and be't of less expect"
Shakespeare,"That matter needless, of importless burden,"
Shakespeare,"Divide thy lips, than we are confident,"
Shakespeare,"When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,"
Shakespeare,"We shall hear music, wit and oracle."
Shakespeare,"Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,"
Shakespeare,"And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,"
Shakespeare,But for these instances.
Shakespeare,The specialty of rule hath been neglected:
Shakespeare,"And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand"
Shakespeare,"Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions."
Shakespeare,When that the general is not like the hive
Shakespeare,"To whom the foragers shall all repair,"
Shakespeare,"What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,"
Shakespeare,The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
Shakespeare,"The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre"
Shakespeare,"Observe degree, priority and place,"
Shakespeare,"Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,"
Shakespeare,"Office and custom, in all line of order,"
Shakespeare,And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
Shakespeare,In noble eminence enthroned and sphered
Shakespeare,"Amidst the other, whose medicinable eye"
Shakespeare,"Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,"
Shakespeare,"And posts, like the commandment of a king,"
Shakespeare,Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets
Shakespeare,"In evil mixture to disorder wander,"
Shakespeare,What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!
Shakespeare,What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!
Shakespeare,"Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,"
Shakespeare,"Divert and crack, rend and deracinate"
Shakespeare,The unity and married calm of states
Shakespeare,"Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,"
Shakespeare,"Which is the ladder to all high designs,"
Shakespeare,"Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,"
Shakespeare,"Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,"
Shakespeare,"Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,"
Shakespeare,"The primogenitive and due of birth,"
Shakespeare,"Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,"
Shakespeare,"But by degree, stand in authentic place?"
Shakespeare,"Take but degree away, untune that string,"
Shakespeare,"And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets"
Shakespeare,In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
Shakespeare,Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
Shakespeare,And make a sop of all this solid globe:
Shakespeare,"Strength should be lord of imbecility,"
Shakespeare,And the rude son should strike his father dead:
Shakespeare,"Force should be right, or rather, right and wrong,"
Shakespeare,"Between whose endless jar justice resides,"
Shakespeare,"Should lose their names, and so should justice too."
Shakespeare,"Then every thing includes itself in power,"
Shakespeare,"Power into will, will into appetite,"
Shakespeare,"And appetite, an universal wolf,"
Shakespeare,"So doubly seconded with will and power,"
Shakespeare,"Must make perforce an universal prey,"
Shakespeare,"And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,"
Shakespeare,"This chaos, when degree is suffocate,"
Shakespeare,Follows the choking.
Shakespeare,And this neglection of degree it is
Shakespeare,"That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose"
Shakespeare,It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd
Shakespeare,"By him one step below, he by the next,"
Shakespeare,"That next by him beneath, so every step,"
Shakespeare,Exampled by the first pace that is sick
Shakespeare,"Of his superior, grows to an envious fever"
Shakespeare,Of pale and bloodless emulation:
Shakespeare,"And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,"
Shakespeare,"Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,"
Shakespeare,"Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength."
Shakespeare,Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
Shakespeare,The fever whereof all our power is sick.
Shakespeare,"The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,"
Shakespeare,What is the remedy?
Shakespeare,"The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns"
Shakespeare,"The sinew and the forehand of our host,"
Shakespeare,"Having his ear full of his airy fame,"
Shakespeare,"Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent"
Shakespeare,Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus
Shakespeare,Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
Shakespeare,"Breaks scurril jests,"
Shakespeare,"And with ridiculous and awkward action,"
Shakespeare,"Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,"
Shakespeare,"He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,"
Shakespeare,"Thy topless deputation he puts on,"
Shakespeare,"And, like a strutting player, whose conceit"
Shakespeare,"Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich"
Shakespeare,To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
Shakespeare,"'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--"
Shakespeare,Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
Shakespeare,"He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,"
Shakespeare,"'Tis like a chime a-mending, with terms unsquared,"
Shakespeare,"Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd"
Shakespeare,Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
Shakespeare,"The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,"
Shakespeare,"From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause,"
Shakespeare,Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
Shakespeare,"Now play me Nestor, hem, and stroke thy beard,"
Shakespeare,As he being drest to some oration.'
Shakespeare,"That's done, as near as the extremest ends"
Shakespeare,"Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:"
Shakespeare,Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!
Shakespeare,"'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,"
Shakespeare,Arming to answer in a night alarm.'
Shakespeare,"And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age"
Shakespeare,"Must be the scene of mirth, to cough and spit,"
Shakespeare,"And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,"
Shakespeare,Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport
Shakespeare,"Sir Valour dies, cries 'O, enough, Patroclus,"
Shakespeare,Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
Shakespeare,"In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,"
Shakespeare,"All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,"
Shakespeare,"Severals and generals of grace exact,"
Shakespeare,"Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,"
Shakespeare,"Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,"
Shakespeare,"Success or loss, what is or is not, serves"
Shakespeare,As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
Shakespeare,And in the imitation of these twain--
Shakespeare,"Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns"
Shakespeare,With an imperial voice--many are infect.
Shakespeare,"Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head"
Shakespeare,"In such a rein, in full as proud a place"
Shakespeare,"As broad Achilles, keeps his tent like him,"
Shakespeare,"Makes factious feasts, rails on our state of war,"
Shakespeare,"Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,"
Shakespeare,"A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,"
Shakespeare,"To match us in comparisons with dirt,"
Shakespeare,"To weaken and discredit our exposure,"
Shakespeare,How rank soever rounded in with danger.
Shakespeare,"They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,"
Shakespeare,"Count wisdom as no member of the war,"
Shakespeare,"Forestall prescience, and esteem no act"
Shakespeare,"But that of hand: the still and mental parts,"
Shakespeare,"That do contrive how many hands shall strike,"
Shakespeare,"When fitness calls them on, and know by measure"
Shakespeare,"Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--"
Shakespeare,"Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:"
Shakespeare,"They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war,"
Shakespeare,"So that the ram that batters down the wall,"
Shakespeare,"For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,"
Shakespeare,"They place before his hand that made the engine,"
Shakespeare,Or those that with the fineness of their souls
Shakespeare,By reason guide his execution.
Shakespeare,"Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse"
Shakespeare,Makes many Thetis' sons.
Shakespeare,A tucket
Shakespeare,"What trumpet? look, Menelaus."
Shakespeare,From Troy.
Shakespeare,Enter AENEAS
Shakespeare,Enter AENEAS
Shakespeare,Enter AENEAS
Shakespeare,What would you 'fore our tent?
Shakespeare,"Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?"
Shakespeare,Even this.
Shakespeare,"May one, that is a herald and a prince,"
Shakespeare,Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
Shakespeare,With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
Shakespeare,"'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice"
Shakespeare,Call Agamemnon head and general.
Shakespeare,Fair leave and large security. How may
Shakespeare,A stranger to those most imperial looks
Shakespeare,Know them from eyes of other mortals?
Shakespeare,"I ask, that I might waken reverence,"
Shakespeare,And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
Shakespeare,Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
Shakespeare,The youthful Phoebus:
Shakespeare,"Which is that god in office, guiding men?"
Shakespeare,Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
Shakespeare,"This Trojan scorns us, or the men of Troy"
Shakespeare,Are ceremonious courtiers.
Shakespeare,"Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,"
Shakespeare,"As bending angels, that's their fame in peace:"
Shakespeare,"But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,"
Shakespeare,"Good arms, strong joints, true swords, and,"
Shakespeare,"Jove's accord,"
Shakespeare,"Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,"
Shakespeare,"Peace, Trojan, lay thy finger on thy lips!"
Shakespeare,"The worthiness of praise distains his worth,"
Shakespeare,If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:
Shakespeare,"But what the repining enemy commends,"
Shakespeare,"That breath fame blows, that praise, sole sure,"
Shakespeare,transcends.
Shakespeare,"Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, Greek, that is my name."
Shakespeare,What's your affair I pray you?
Shakespeare,"Sir, pardon, 'tis for Agamemnon's ears."
Shakespeare,He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
Shakespeare,Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:
Shakespeare,"I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,"
Shakespeare,"To set his sense on the attentive bent,"
Shakespeare,And then to speak.
Shakespeare,"Speak frankly as the wind,"
Shakespeare,It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:
Shakespeare,"That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,"
Shakespeare,He tells thee so himself.
Shakespeare,"Trumpet, blow loud,"
Shakespeare,"Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents,"
Shakespeare,"And every Greek of mettle, let him know,"
Shakespeare,What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
Shakespeare,"We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy"
Shakespeare,"A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--"
Shakespeare,Who in this dull and long-continued truce
Shakespeare,"Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,"
Shakespeare,"And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!"
Shakespeare,If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
Shakespeare,"That holds his honour higher than his ease,"
Shakespeare,"That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,"
Shakespeare,"That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,"
Shakespeare,"That loves his mistress more than in confession,"
Shakespeare,"With truant vows to her own lips he loves,"
Shakespeare,And dare avow her beauty and her worth
Shakespeare,"In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge."
Shakespeare,"Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,"
Shakespeare,"Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,"
Shakespeare,"He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,"
Shakespeare,"Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,"
Shakespeare,And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
Shakespeare,"Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,"
Shakespeare,To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:
Shakespeare,"If any come, Hector shall honour him,"
Shakespeare,"If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,"
Shakespeare,The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
Shakespeare,The splinter of a lance. Even so much.
Shakespeare,"This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas,"
Shakespeare,"If none of them have soul in such a kind,"
Shakespeare,"We left them all at home: but we are soldiers,"
Shakespeare,"And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,"
Shakespeare,"That means not, hath not, or is not in love!"
Shakespeare,"If then one is, or hath, or means to be,"
Shakespeare,"That one meets Hector, if none else, I am he."
Shakespeare,"Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man"
Shakespeare,"When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now,"
Shakespeare,But if there be not in our Grecian host
Shakespeare,"One noble man that hath one spark of fire,"
Shakespeare,"To answer for his love, tell him from me"
Shakespeare,I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
Shakespeare,"And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,"
Shakespeare,And meeting him will tell him that my lady
Shakespeare,Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
Shakespeare,"As may be in the world: his youth in flood,"
Shakespeare,I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.
Shakespeare,Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!
Shakespeare,"Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand,"
Shakespeare,"To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir."
Shakespeare,"Achilles shall have word of this intent,"
Shakespeare,"So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:"
Shakespeare,Yourself shall feast with us before you go
Shakespeare,And find the welcome of a noble foe.
Shakespeare,Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR
Shakespeare,Nestor!
Shakespeare,What says Ulysses?
Shakespeare,"I have a young conception in my brain,"
Shakespeare,Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
Shakespeare,What is't?
Shakespeare,This 'tis:
Shakespeare,Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride
Shakespeare,That hath to this maturity blown up
Shakespeare,"In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,"
Shakespeare,"Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,"
Shakespeare,To overbulk us all.
Shakespeare,"Well, and how?"
Shakespeare,"This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,"
Shakespeare,"However it is spread in general name,"
Shakespeare,Relates in purpose only to Achilles.
Shakespeare,"The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,"
Shakespeare,Whose grossness little characters sum up:
Shakespeare,"And, in the publication, make no strain,"
Shakespeare,"But that Achilles, were his brain as barren"
Shakespeare,"As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,"
Shakespeare,"'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,"
Shakespeare,"Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose"
Shakespeare,Pointing on him.
Shakespeare,"And wake him to the answer, think you?"
Shakespeare,"Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,"
Shakespeare,"That can from Hector bring his honour off,"
Shakespeare,"If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,"
Shakespeare,"Yet in the trial much opinion dwells,"
Shakespeare,For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
Shakespeare,"With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,"
Shakespeare,Our imputation shall be oddly poised
Shakespeare,"In this wild action, for the success,"
Shakespeare,"Although particular, shall give a scantling"
Shakespeare,"Of good or bad unto the general,"
Shakespeare,"And in such indexes, although small pricks"
Shakespeare,"To their subsequent volumes, there is seen"
Shakespeare,The baby figure of the giant mass
Shakespeare,Of things to come at large. It is supposed
Shakespeare,He that meets Hector issues from our choice
Shakespeare,"And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,"
Shakespeare,"Makes merit her election, and doth boil,"
Shakespeare,"As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd"
Shakespeare,"Out of our virtues, who miscarrying,"
Shakespeare,"What heart receives from hence the conquering part,"
Shakespeare,To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
Shakespeare,"Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,"
Shakespeare,In no less working than are swords and bows
Shakespeare,Directive by the limbs.
Shakespeare,Give pardon to my speech:
Shakespeare,Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
Shakespeare,"Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,"
Shakespeare,"And think, perchance, they'll sell, if not,"
Shakespeare,"The lustre of the better yet to show,"
Shakespeare,Shall show the better. Do not consent
Shakespeare,"That ever Hector and Achilles meet,"
Shakespeare,For both our honour and our shame in this
Shakespeare,Are dogg'd with two strange followers.
Shakespeare,I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?
Shakespeare,"What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,"
Shakespeare,"Were he not proud, we all should share with him:"
Shakespeare,"But he already is too insolent,"
Shakespeare,A nd we were better parch in Afric sun
Shakespeare,"Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,"
Shakespeare,"Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,"
Shakespeare,"Why then, we did our main opinion crush"
Shakespeare,"In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery,"
Shakespeare,"And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw"
Shakespeare,The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves
Shakespeare,"Give him allowance for the better man,"
Shakespeare,For that will physic the great Myrmidon
Shakespeare,"Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall"
Shakespeare,His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
Shakespeare,"If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,"
Shakespeare,"We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,"
Shakespeare,Yet go we under our opinion still
Shakespeare,"That we have better men. But, hit or miss,"
Shakespeare,Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:
Shakespeare,Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.
Shakespeare,"Ulysses,"
Shakespeare,"Now I begin to relish thy advice,"
Shakespeare,And I will give a taste of it forthwith
Shakespeare,To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.
Shakespeare,Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
Shakespeare,"Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. A part of the Grecian camp.
Shakespeare,Enter AJAX and THERSITES
Shakespeare,Thersites!
Shakespeare,Thersites!
Shakespeare,"Agamemnon, how if he had boils? full, all over,"
Shakespeare,generally?
Shakespeare,And those boils did run? say so: did not the
Shakespeare,general run then? were not that a botchy core?
Shakespeare,Dog!
Shakespeare,"Then would come some matter from him, I see none now."
Shakespeare,"Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?"
Shakespeare,"Feel, then."
Shakespeare,"The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel"
Shakespeare,beef-witted lord!
Shakespeare,"Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will"
Shakespeare,beat thee into handsomeness.
Shakespeare,"I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but,"
Shakespeare,"I think, thy horse will sooner con an oration than"
Shakespeare,"thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,"
Shakespeare,canst thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!
Shakespeare,"Toadstool, learn me the proclamation."
Shakespeare,"Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?"
Shakespeare,The proclamation!
Shakespeare,"Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think."
Shakespeare,"Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch."
Shakespeare,I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had
Shakespeare,"the scratching of thee, I would make thee the"
Shakespeare,loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in
Shakespeare,"the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another."
Shakespeare,"I say, the proclamation!"
Shakespeare,"Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,"
Shakespeare,and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as
Shakespeare,"Cerberus is at Proserpine's beauty, ay, that thou"
Shakespeare,barkest at him.
Shakespeare,Mistress Thersites!
Shakespeare,Thou shouldest strike him.
Shakespeare,Cobloaf!
Shakespeare,"He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a"
Shakespeare,sailor breaks a biscuit.
Shakespeare,[Beating him]  You whoreson cur!
Shakespeare,"Do, do."
Shakespeare,"Do, do."
Shakespeare,Thou stool for a witch!
Shakespeare,"Ay, do, do, thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no"
Shakespeare,"more brain than I have in mine elbows, an assinego"
Shakespeare,may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art
Shakespeare,"here but to thrash Trojans, and thou art bought and"
Shakespeare,"sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave."
Shakespeare,"If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel, and"
Shakespeare,"tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no"
Shakespeare,"bowels, thou!"
Shakespeare,You dog!
Shakespeare,You scurvy lord!
Shakespeare,[Beating him]  You cur!
Shakespeare,"Mars his idiot! do, rudeness, do, camel, do, do."
Shakespeare,Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
Shakespeare,Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
Shakespeare,"Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,"
Shakespeare,"Thersites! what's the matter, man?"
Shakespeare,"You see him there, do you?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, what's the matter?"
Shakespeare,"Nay, look upon him."
Shakespeare,So I do: what's the matter?
Shakespeare,"Nay, but regard him well."
Shakespeare,"'Well!' why, I do so."
Shakespeare,"But yet you look not well upon him, for whosoever you"
Shakespeare,"take him to be, he is Ajax."
Shakespeare,"I know that, fool."
Shakespeare,"Ay, but that fool knows not himself."
Shakespeare,Therefore I beat thee.
Shakespeare,"Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! his"
Shakespeare,evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his
Shakespeare,brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy
Shakespeare,"nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not"
Shakespeare,"worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord,"
Shakespeare,"Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly and"
Shakespeare,"his guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say of"
Shakespeare,"I say, this Ajax--"
Shakespeare,Ajax offers to beat him
Shakespeare,"Nay, good Ajax."
Shakespeare,Has not so much wit--
Shakespeare,"Nay, I must hold you."
Shakespeare,"As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he"
Shakespeare,comes to fight.
Shakespeare,"Peace, fool!"
Shakespeare,"I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will"
Shakespeare,not: he there: that he: look you there.
Shakespeare,O thou damned cur! I shall--
Shakespeare,Will you set your wit to a fool's?
Shakespeare,"No, I warrant you, for a fools will shame it."
Shakespeare,"Good words, Thersites."
Shakespeare,What's the quarrel?
Shakespeare,I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the
Shakespeare,"proclamation, and he rails upon me."
Shakespeare,I serve thee not.
Shakespeare,"Well, go to, go to."
Shakespeare,I serve here voluntarily.
Shakespeare,"Your last service was sufferance, 'twas not"
Shakespeare,voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was
Shakespeare,"here the voluntary, and you as under an impress."
Shakespeare,"E'en so, a great deal of your wit, too, lies in your"
Shakespeare,"sinews, or else there be liars. Hector have a great"
Shakespeare,"catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a'"
Shakespeare,were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.
Shakespeare,"What, with me too, Thersites?"
Shakespeare,"There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldy"
Shakespeare,"ere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke you"
Shakespeare,like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.
Shakespeare,"What, what?"
Shakespeare,"What, what?"
Shakespeare,"Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!"
Shakespeare,I shall cut out your tongue.
Shakespeare,'Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thou
Shakespeare,afterwards.
Shakespeare,"No more words, Thersites, peace!"
Shakespeare,"I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?"
Shakespeare,"There's for you, Patroclus."
Shakespeare,"I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come"
Shakespeare,any more to your tents: I will keep where there is
Shakespeare,wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.
Shakespeare,A good riddance.
Shakespeare,"Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host:"
Shakespeare,"That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,"
Shakespeare,Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy
Shakespeare,To-morrow morning call some knight to arms
Shakespeare,"That hath a stomach, and such a one that dare"
Shakespeare,Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.
Shakespeare,Farewell. Who shall answer him?
Shakespeare,"I know not: 'tis put to lottery, otherwise"
Shakespeare,He knew his man.
Shakespeare,"O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it."
Shakespeare,SCENE II. Troy. A room in Priam's palace.
Shakespeare,"Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUS"
Shakespeare,"After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,"
Shakespeare,Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
Shakespeare,"'Deliver Helen, and all damage else--"
Shakespeare,"As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,"
Shakespeare,"Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed"
Shakespeare,In hot digestion of this cormorant war--
Shakespeare,"Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?"
Shakespeare,Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
Shakespeare,"As far as toucheth my particular,"
Shakespeare,"Yet, dread Priam,"
Shakespeare,"There is no lady of more softer bowels,"
Shakespeare,"More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,"
Shakespeare,More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
Shakespeare,"Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,"
Shakespeare,"Surety secure, but modest doubt is call'd"
Shakespeare,"The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches"
Shakespeare,To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
Shakespeare,"Since the first sword was drawn about this question,"
Shakespeare,"Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,"
Shakespeare,"Hath been as dear as Helen, I mean, of ours:"
Shakespeare,"If we have lost so many tenths of ours,"
Shakespeare,"To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,"
Shakespeare,"Had it our name, the value of one ten,"
Shakespeare,What merit's in that reason which denies
Shakespeare,The yielding of her up?
Shakespeare,"Fie, fie, my brother!"
Shakespeare,Weigh you the worth and honour of a king
Shakespeare,So great as our dread father in a scale
Shakespeare,Of common ounces? will you with counters sum
Shakespeare,The past proportion of his infinite?
Shakespeare,And buckle in a waist most fathomless
Shakespeare,With spans and inches so diminutive
Shakespeare,"As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!"
Shakespeare,"No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,"
Shakespeare,You are so empty of them. Should not our father
Shakespeare,"Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,"
Shakespeare,Because your speech hath none that tells him so?
Shakespeare,"You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest,"
Shakespeare,You fur your gloves with reason. Here are
Shakespeare,your reasons:
Shakespeare,"You know an enemy intends you harm,"
Shakespeare,"You know a sword employ'd is perilous,"
Shakespeare,And reason flies the object of all harm:
Shakespeare,"Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds"
Shakespeare,"A Grecian and his sword, if he do set"
Shakespeare,The very wings of reason to his heels
Shakespeare,"And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,"
Shakespeare,"Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,"
Shakespeare,Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour
Shakespeare,"Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat"
Shakespeare,their thoughts
Shakespeare,With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect
Shakespeare,Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
Shakespeare,"Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost"
Shakespeare,The holding.
Shakespeare,"What is aught, but as 'tis valued?"
Shakespeare,"But value dwells not in particular will,"
Shakespeare,It holds his estimate and dignity
Shakespeare,As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
Shakespeare,As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry
Shakespeare,To make the service greater than the god
Shakespeare,And the will dotes that is attributive
Shakespeare,"To what infectiously itself affects,"
Shakespeare,Without some image of the affected merit.
Shakespeare,"I take to-day a wife, and my election"
Shakespeare,"Is led on in the conduct of my will,"
Shakespeare,"My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,"
Shakespeare,Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
Shakespeare,"Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,"
Shakespeare,"Although my will distaste what it elected,"
Shakespeare,The wife I chose? there can be no evasion
Shakespeare,To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:
Shakespeare,"We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,"
Shakespeare,"When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands"
Shakespeare,"We do not throw in unrespective sieve,"
Shakespeare,Because we now are full. It was thought meet
Shakespeare,Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
Shakespeare,"Your breath of full consent bellied his sails,"
Shakespeare,"The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce"
Shakespeare,"And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,"
Shakespeare,"And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,"
Shakespeare,"He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness"
Shakespeare,"Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning."
Shakespeare,Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:
Shakespeare,"Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,"
Shakespeare,"Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,"
Shakespeare,And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
Shakespeare,If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
Shakespeare,"As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--"
Shakespeare,If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--
Shakespeare,"As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands"
Shakespeare,And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now
Shakespeare,"The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,"
Shakespeare,"And do a deed that fortune never did,"
Shakespeare,Beggar the estimation which you prized
Shakespeare,"Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,"
Shakespeare,That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
Shakespeare,"But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,"
Shakespeare,"That in their country did them that disgrace,"
Shakespeare,We fear to warrant in our native place!
Shakespeare,"[Within]  Cry, Trojans, cry!"
Shakespeare,What noise? what shriek is this?
Shakespeare,"'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice."
Shakespeare,"[Within]  Cry, Trojans!"
Shakespeare,It is Cassandra.
Shakespeare,"Enter CASSANDRA, raving"
Shakespeare,"Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,"
Shakespeare,And I will fill them with prophetic tears.
Shakespeare,"Peace, sister, peace!"
Shakespeare,"Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,"
Shakespeare,"Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,"
Shakespeare,Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes
Shakespeare,A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
Shakespeare,"Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!"
Shakespeare,"Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand,"
Shakespeare,"Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all."
Shakespeare,"Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:"
Shakespeare,"Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go."
Shakespeare,"Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains"
Shakespeare,Of divination in our sister work
Shakespeare,Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
Shakespeare,"So madly hot that no discourse of reason,"
Shakespeare,"Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,"
Shakespeare,Can qualify the same?
Shakespeare,"Why, brother Hector,"
Shakespeare,We may not think the justness of each act
Shakespeare,"Such and no other than event doth form it,"
Shakespeare,"Nor once deject the courage of our minds,"
Shakespeare,Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures
Shakespeare,Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
Shakespeare,Which hath our several honours all engaged
Shakespeare,"To make it gracious. For my private part,"
Shakespeare,I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:
Shakespeare,And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
Shakespeare,Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
Shakespeare,To fight for and maintain!
Shakespeare,Else might the world convince of levity
Shakespeare,As well my undertakings as your counsels:
Shakespeare,"But I attest the gods, your full consent"
Shakespeare,Gave wings to my propension and cut off
Shakespeare,All fears attending on so dire a project.
Shakespeare,"For what, alas, can these my single arms?"
Shakespeare,"What Propugnation is in one man's valour,"
Shakespeare,To stand the push and enmity of those
Shakespeare,"This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,"
Shakespeare,Were I alone to pass the difficulties
Shakespeare,"And had as ample power as I have will,"
Shakespeare,"Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,"
Shakespeare,Nor faint in the pursuit.
Shakespeare,"Paris, you speak"
Shakespeare,Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
Shakespeare,"You have the honey still, but these the gall,"
Shakespeare,So to be valiant is no praise at all.
Shakespeare,"Sir, I propose not merely to myself"
Shakespeare,"The pleasures such a beauty brings with it,"
Shakespeare,But I would have the soil of her fair rape
Shakespeare,"Wiped off, in honourable keeping her."
Shakespeare,"What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,"
Shakespeare,"Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,"
Shakespeare,Now to deliver her possession up
Shakespeare,On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
Shakespeare,That so degenerate a strain as this
Shakespeare,Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
Shakespeare,There's not the meanest spirit on our party
Shakespeare,Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
Shakespeare,"When Helen is defended, nor none so noble"
Shakespeare,Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
Shakespeare,"Where Helen is the subject, then, I say,"
Shakespeare,"Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,"
Shakespeare,The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
Shakespeare,"Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,"
Shakespeare,And on the cause and question now in hand
Shakespeare,"Have glozed, but superficially: not much"
Shakespeare,"Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought"
Shakespeare,Unfit to hear moral philosophy:
Shakespeare,The reasons you allege do more conduce
Shakespeare,To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
Shakespeare,Than to make up a free determination
Shakespeare,"'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge"
Shakespeare,Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
Shakespeare,Of any true decision. Nature craves
Shakespeare,"All dues be render'd to their owners: now,"
Shakespeare,What nearer debt in all humanity
Shakespeare,Than wife is to the husband? If this law
Shakespeare,"Of nature be corrupted through affection,"
Shakespeare,"And that great minds, of partial indulgence"
Shakespeare,"To their benumbed wills, resist the same,"
Shakespeare,There is a law in each well-order'd nation
Shakespeare,To curb those raging appetites that are
Shakespeare,Most disobedient and refractory.
Shakespeare,"If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,"
Shakespeare,"As it is known she is, these moral laws"
Shakespeare,Of nature and of nations speak aloud
Shakespeare,To have her back return'd: thus to persist
Shakespeare,"In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,"
Shakespeare,But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
Shakespeare,"Is this in way of truth, yet ne'ertheless,"
Shakespeare,"My spritely brethren, I propend to you"
Shakespeare,"In resolution to keep Helen still,"
Shakespeare,For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
Shakespeare,Upon our joint and several dignities.
Shakespeare,"Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:"
Shakespeare,Were it not glory that we more affected
Shakespeare,"Than the performance of our heaving spleens,"
Shakespeare,I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
Shakespeare,"Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,"
Shakespeare,"She is a theme of honour and renown,"
Shakespeare,"A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,"
Shakespeare,"Whose present courage may beat down our foes,"
Shakespeare,"And fame in time to come canonize us,"
Shakespeare,"For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose"
Shakespeare,So rich advantage of a promised glory
Shakespeare,As smiles upon the forehead of this action
Shakespeare,For the wide world's revenue.
Shakespeare,"I am yours,"
Shakespeare,You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
Shakespeare,I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
Shakespeare,The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks
Shakespeare,Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:
Shakespeare,"I was advertised their great general slept,"
Shakespeare,Whilst emulation in the army crept:
Shakespeare,"This, I presume, will wake him."
Shakespeare,SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.
Shakespeare,SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.
Shakespeare,"Enter THERSITES, solus"
Shakespeare,"How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of"
Shakespeare,thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He
Shakespeare,"beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!"
Shakespeare,"would it were otherwise, that I could beat him,"
Shakespeare,"whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to"
Shakespeare,"conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of"
Shakespeare,"my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a"
Shakespeare,rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two
Shakespeare,"undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of"
Shakespeare,"themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,"
Shakespeare,"forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,"
Shakespeare,"Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy"
Shakespeare,"caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less"
Shakespeare,than little wit from them that they have! which
Shakespeare,short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
Shakespeare,"scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly"
Shakespeare,"from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and"
Shakespeare,"cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the"
Shakespeare,"whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,"
Shakespeare,"methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war"
Shakespeare,for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy
Shakespeare,say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!
Shakespeare,Enter PATROCLUS
Shakespeare,"Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail."
Shakespeare,"If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou"
Shakespeare,wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but
Shakespeare,"it is no matter, thyself upon thyself! The common"
Shakespeare,"curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in"
Shakespeare,"great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and"
Shakespeare,discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy
Shakespeare,direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee
Shakespeare,"out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and"
Shakespeare,sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.
Shakespeare,Amen. Where's Achilles?
Shakespeare,"What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?"
Shakespeare,Ay: the heavens hear me!
Shakespeare,Enter ACHILLES
Shakespeare,Enter ACHILLES
Shakespeare,Enter ACHILLES
Shakespeare,"Thersites, my lord."
Shakespeare,"Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, my"
Shakespeare,"digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to"
Shakespeare,"my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?"
Shakespeare,"Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,"
Shakespeare,what's Achilles?
Shakespeare,"Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,"
Shakespeare,what's thyself?
Shakespeare,"Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,"
Shakespeare,what art thou?
Shakespeare,Thou mayst tell that knowest.
Shakespeare,"O, tell, tell."
Shakespeare,I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands
Shakespeare,"Achilles, Achilles is my lord, I am Patroclus'"
Shakespeare,"knower, and Patroclus is a fool."
Shakespeare,You rascal!
Shakespeare,"Peace, fool! I have not done."
Shakespeare,"He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites."
Shakespeare,"Agamemnon is a fool, Achilles is a fool, Thersites"
Shakespeare,"is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool."
Shakespeare,"Derive this, come."
Shakespeare,"Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles,"
Shakespeare,"Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon,"
Shakespeare,"Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and"
Shakespeare,Patroclus is a fool positive.
Shakespeare,Why am I a fool?
Shakespeare,Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou
Shakespeare,"art. Look you, who comes here?"
Shakespeare,"Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody."
Shakespeare,"Come in with me, Thersites."
Shakespeare,"Here is such patchery, such juggling and such"
Shakespeare,knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a
Shakespeare,"whore, a good quarrel to draw emulous factions"
Shakespeare,"and bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on"
Shakespeare,the subject! and war and lechery confound all!
Shakespeare,"Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and AJAX"
Shakespeare,Where is Achilles?
Shakespeare,"Within his tent, but ill disposed, my lord."
Shakespeare,Let it be known to him that we are here.
Shakespeare,"He shent our messengers, and we lay by"
Shakespeare,"Our appertainments, visiting of him:"
Shakespeare,"Let him be told so, lest perchance he think"
Shakespeare,"We dare not move the question of our place,"
Shakespeare,Or know not what we are.
Shakespeare,I shall say so to him.
Shakespeare,We saw him at the opening of his tent:
Shakespeare,He is not sick.
Shakespeare,"Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it"
Shakespeare,"melancholy, if you will favour the man, but, by my"
Shakespeare,"head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us the"
Shakespeare,"cause. A word, my lord."
Shakespeare,Takes AGAMEMNON aside
Shakespeare,What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?
Shakespeare,Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.
Shakespeare,"Who, Thersites?"
Shakespeare,"Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument."
Shakespeare,"No, you see, he is his argument that has his"
Shakespeare,"argument, Achilles."
Shakespeare,"All the better, their fraction is more our wish than"
Shakespeare,their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool
Shakespeare,could disunite.
Shakespeare,"The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily"
Shakespeare,untie. Here comes Patroclus.
Shakespeare,Re-enter PATROCLUS
Shakespeare,No Achilles with him.
Shakespeare,"The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:"
Shakespeare,"his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure."
Shakespeare,"Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,"
Shakespeare,If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
Shakespeare,Did move your greatness and this noble state
Shakespeare,"To call upon him, he hopes it is no other"
Shakespeare,"But for your health and your digestion sake,"
Shakespeare,And after-dinner's breath.
Shakespeare,"Hear you, Patroclus:"
Shakespeare,We are too well acquainted with these answers:
Shakespeare,"But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,"
Shakespeare,Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
Shakespeare,"Much attribute he hath, and much the reason"
Shakespeare,"Why we ascribe it to him, yet all his virtues,"
Shakespeare,"Not virtuously on his own part beheld,"
Shakespeare,"Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,"
Shakespeare,"Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,"
Shakespeare,"Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,"
Shakespeare,"We come to speak with him, and you shall not sin,"
Shakespeare,If you do say we think him over-proud
Shakespeare,"And under-honest, in self-assumption greater"
Shakespeare,"Than in the note of judgment, and worthier"
Shakespeare,than himself
Shakespeare,"Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,"
Shakespeare,"Disguise the holy strength of their command,"
Shakespeare,And underwrite in an observing kind
Shakespeare,"His humorous predominance, yea, watch"
Shakespeare,"His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if"
Shakespeare,The passage and whole carriage of this action
Shakespeare,"Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,"
Shakespeare,"That if he overhold his price so much,"
Shakespeare,"We'll none of him, but let him, like an engine"
Shakespeare,"Not portable, lie under this report:"
Shakespeare,"'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:"
Shakespeare,A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
Shakespeare,Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.
Shakespeare,"I shall, and bring his answer presently."
Shakespeare,"In second voice we'll not be satisfied,"
Shakespeare,"We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you."
Shakespeare,Exit ULYSSES
Shakespeare,What is he more than another?
Shakespeare,No more than what he thinks he is.
Shakespeare,Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a
Shakespeare,better man than I am?
Shakespeare,No question.
Shakespeare,No question.
Shakespeare,"Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?"
Shakespeare,"No, noble Ajax, you are as strong, as valiant, as"
Shakespeare,"wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether"
Shakespeare,more tractable.
Shakespeare,Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I
Shakespeare,know not what pride is.
Shakespeare,"Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the"
Shakespeare,fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is
Shakespeare,"his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle,"
Shakespeare,"and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours"
Shakespeare,the deed in the praise.
Shakespeare,"I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads."
Shakespeare,Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
Shakespeare,Re-enter ULYSSES
Shakespeare,Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.
Shakespeare,What's his excuse?
Shakespeare,"He doth rely on none,"
Shakespeare,But carries on the stream of his dispose
Shakespeare,"Without observance or respect of any,"
Shakespeare,In will peculiar and in self-admission.
Shakespeare,Why will he not upon our fair request
Shakespeare,Untent his person and share the air with us?
Shakespeare,"Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,"
Shakespeare,"He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,"
Shakespeare,And speaks not to himself but with a pride
Shakespeare,That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth
Shakespeare,Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
Shakespeare,That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
Shakespeare,Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages
Shakespeare,And batters down himself: what should I say?
Shakespeare,He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it
Shakespeare,Cry 'No recovery.'
Shakespeare,Let Ajax go to him.
Shakespeare,"Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:"
Shakespeare,"'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led"
Shakespeare,At your request a little from himself.
Shakespeare,"O Agamemnon, let it not be so!"
Shakespeare,We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
Shakespeare,When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord
Shakespeare,That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
Shakespeare,And never suffers matter of the world
Shakespeare,"Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve"
Shakespeare,"And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd"
Shakespeare,Of that we hold an idol more than he?
Shakespeare,"No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord"
Shakespeare,"Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired,"
Shakespeare,"Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,"
Shakespeare,"As amply titled as Achilles is,"
Shakespeare,By going to Achilles:
Shakespeare,That were to enlard his fat already pride
Shakespeare,And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
Shakespeare,With entertaining great Hyperion.
Shakespeare,"This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,"
Shakespeare,And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'
Shakespeare,"[Aside to DIOMEDES]  O, this is well, he rubs the"
Shakespeare,vein of him.
Shakespeare,[Aside to NESTOR]  And how his silence drinks up
Shakespeare,this applause!
Shakespeare,"If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face."
Shakespeare,"O, no, you shall not go."
Shakespeare,"An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:"
Shakespeare,Let me go to him.
Shakespeare,Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
Shakespeare,"A paltry, insolent fellow!"
Shakespeare,How he describes himself!
Shakespeare,Can he not be sociable?
Shakespeare,The raven chides blackness.
Shakespeare,I'll let his humours blood.
Shakespeare,He will be the physician that should be the patient.
Shakespeare,"An all men were o' my mind,--"
Shakespeare,Wit would be out of fashion.
Shakespeare,"A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:"
Shakespeare,shall pride carry it?
Shakespeare,"An 'twould, you'ld carry half."
Shakespeare,A' would have ten shares.
Shakespeare,"I will knead him, I'll make him supple."
Shakespeare,He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:
Shakespeare,"pour in, pour in, his ambition is dry."
Shakespeare,"[To AGAMEMNON]  My lord, you feed too much on this dislike."
Shakespeare,"Our noble general, do not do so."
Shakespeare,You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
Shakespeare,"Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm."
Shakespeare,"Here is a man--but 'tis before his face,"
Shakespeare,I will be silent.
Shakespeare,Wherefore should you so?
Shakespeare,"He is not emulous, as Achilles is."
Shakespeare,"Know the whole world, he is as valiant."
Shakespeare,"A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!"
Shakespeare,Would he were a Trojan!
Shakespeare,"What a vice were it in Ajax now,--"
Shakespeare,"If he were proud,--"
Shakespeare,"Or covetous of praise,--"
Shakespeare,"Ay, or surly borne,--"
Shakespeare,"Or strange, or self-affected!"
Shakespeare,"Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure,"
Shakespeare,"Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:"
Shakespeare,"Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature"
Shakespeare,"Thrice famed, beyond all erudition:"
Shakespeare,"But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,"
Shakespeare,"Let Mars divide eternity in twain,"
Shakespeare,"And give him half: and, for thy vigour,"
Shakespeare,Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield
Shakespeare,"To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,"
Shakespeare,"Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines"
Shakespeare,"Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor,"
Shakespeare,"Instructed by the antiquary times,"
Shakespeare,"He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:"
Shakespeare,"Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days"
Shakespeare,"As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,"
Shakespeare,"You should not have the eminence of him,"
Shakespeare,But be as Ajax.
Shakespeare,Shall I call you father?
Shakespeare,"Ay, my good son."
Shakespeare,"Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax."
Shakespeare,"There is no tarrying here, the hart Achilles"
Shakespeare,Keeps thicket. Please it our great general
Shakespeare,"To call together all his state of war,"
Shakespeare,Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow
Shakespeare,We must with all our main of power stand fast:
Shakespeare,"And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,"
Shakespeare,"And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best."
Shakespeare,Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
Shakespeare,"Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Troy. Priam's palace.
Shakespeare,Enter a Servant and PANDARUS
Shakespeare,"Friend, you! pray you, a word: do not you follow"
Shakespeare,the young Lord Paris?
Shakespeare,"Ay, sir, when he goes before me."
Shakespeare,"You depend upon him, I mean?"
Shakespeare,"Sir, I do depend upon the lord."
Shakespeare,"You depend upon a noble gentleman, I must needs"
Shakespeare,praise him.
Shakespeare,The lord be praised!
Shakespeare,"You know me, do you not?"
Shakespeare,"You know me, do you not?"
Shakespeare,"Faith, sir, superficially."
Shakespeare,"Friend, know me better, I am the Lord Pandarus."
Shakespeare,I hope I shall know your honour better.
Shakespeare,I do desire it.
Shakespeare,I do desire it.
Shakespeare,You are in the state of grace.
Shakespeare,"Grace! not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles."
Shakespeare,What music is this?
Shakespeare,"I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts."
Shakespeare,Know you the musicians?
Shakespeare,"Wholly, sir."
Shakespeare,Who play they to?
Shakespeare,"To the hearers, sir."
Shakespeare,"At whose pleasure, friend"
Shakespeare,"At mine, sir, and theirs that love music."
Shakespeare,"Command, I mean, friend."
Shakespeare,"Who shall I command, sir?"
Shakespeare,"Friend, we understand not one another: I am too"
Shakespeare,courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose request
Shakespeare,do these men play?
Shakespeare,"That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request"
Shakespeare,"of Paris my lord, who's there in person, with him,"
Shakespeare,"the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's"
Shakespeare,"invisible soul,--"
Shakespeare,"Who, my cousin Cressida?"
Shakespeare,"No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her"
Shakespeare,attributes?
Shakespeare,"It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the"
Shakespeare,Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the
Shakespeare,Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault
Shakespeare,"upon him, for my business seethes."
Shakespeare,Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!
Shakespeare,"Enter PARIS and HELEN, attended"
Shakespeare,"Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair"
Shakespeare,"company! fair desires, in all fair measure,"
Shakespeare,"fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen!"
Shakespeare,fair thoughts be your fair pillow!
Shakespeare,"Dear lord, you are full of fair words."
Shakespeare,"You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair"
Shakespeare,"prince, here is good broken music."
Shakespeare,"You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you"
Shakespeare,"shall make it whole again, you shall piece it out"
Shakespeare,"with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full"
Shakespeare,of harmony.
Shakespeare,"Truly, lady, no."
Shakespeare,"O, sir,--"
Shakespeare,"Rude, in sooth, in good sooth, very rude."
Shakespeare,"Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits."
Shakespeare,"I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord,"
Shakespeare,will you vouchsafe me a word?
Shakespeare,"Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you"
Shakespeare,"sing, certainly."
Shakespeare,"Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,"
Shakespeare,"marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed"
Shakespeare,"friend, your brother Troilus,--"
Shakespeare,"My Lord Pandarus, honey-sweet lord,--"
Shakespeare,"Go to, sweet queen, to go:--commends himself most"
Shakespeare,"affectionately to you,--"
Shakespeare,"You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,"
Shakespeare,our melancholy upon your head!
Shakespeare,"Sweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith."
Shakespeare,And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.
Shakespeare,"Nay, that shall not serve your turn, that shall not,"
Shakespeare,"in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words, no,"
Shakespeare,"no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king"
Shakespeare,"call for him at supper, you will make his excuse."
Shakespeare,"My Lord Pandarus,--"
Shakespeare,"What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?"
Shakespeare,What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?
Shakespeare,"Nay, but, my lord,--"
Shakespeare,What says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall out
Shakespeare,with you. You must not know where he sups.
Shakespeare,"I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida."
Shakespeare,"No, no, no such matter, you are wide: come, your"
Shakespeare,disposer is sick.
Shakespeare,"Well, I'll make excuse."
Shakespeare,"Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? no,"
Shakespeare,your poor disposer's sick.
Shakespeare,I spy.
Shakespeare,"You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an"
Shakespeare,"instrument. Now, sweet queen."
Shakespeare,"Why, this is kindly done."
Shakespeare,"My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,"
Shakespeare,sweet queen.
Shakespeare,"She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris."
Shakespeare,"He! no, she'll none of him, they two are twain."
Shakespeare,"Falling in, after falling out, may make them three."
Shakespeare,"Come, come, I'll hear no more of this, I'll sing"
Shakespeare,you a song now.
Shakespeare,"Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou"
Shakespeare,hast a fine forehead.
Shakespeare,"Ay, you may, you may."
Shakespeare,Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.
Shakespeare,"O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!"
Shakespeare,"Love! ay, that it shall, i' faith."
Shakespeare,"Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love."
Shakespeare,"In good troth, it begins so."
Shakespeare,"Love, love, nothing but love, still more!"
Shakespeare,"For, O, love's bow"
Shakespeare,Shoots buck and doe:
Shakespeare,"The shaft confounds,"
Shakespeare,"Not that it wounds,"
Shakespeare,But tickles still the sore.
Shakespeare,These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!
Shakespeare,"Yet that which seems the wound to kill,"
Shakespeare,Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!
Shakespeare,So dying love lives still:
Shakespeare,"Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha!"
Shakespeare,Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!
Shakespeare,Heigh-ho!
Shakespeare,"In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose."
Shakespeare,"He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot"
Shakespeare,"blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot"
Shakespeare,"thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love."
Shakespeare,"Is this the generation of love? hot blood, hot"
Shakespeare,"thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers:"
Shakespeare,"is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's"
Shakespeare,a-field to-day?
Shakespeare,"Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the"
Shakespeare,"gallantry of Troy: I  would fain have armed to-day,"
Shakespeare,but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my
Shakespeare,brother Troilus went not?
Shakespeare,"He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord Pandarus."
Shakespeare,"Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they"
Shakespeare,sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?
Shakespeare,To a hair.
Shakespeare,"Farewell, sweet queen."
Shakespeare,Commend me to your niece.
Shakespeare,"I will, sweet queen."
Shakespeare,"They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,"
Shakespeare,"To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you"
Shakespeare,"To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,"
Shakespeare,"With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,"
Shakespeare,Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
Shakespeare,"Or force of Greekish sinews, you shall do more"
Shakespeare,"Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector."
Shakespeare,"'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris,"
Shakespeare,"Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty"
Shakespeare,"Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,"
Shakespeare,"Yea, overshines ourself."
Shakespeare,"Sweet, above thought I love thee."
Shakespeare,SCENE II. The same. Pandarus' orchard.
Shakespeare,"Enter PANDARUS and Troilus's Boy, meeting"
Shakespeare,How now! where's thy master? at my cousin
Shakespeare,Cressida's?
Shakespeare,"No, sir, he stays for you to conduct him thither."
Shakespeare,"O, here he comes."
Shakespeare,Enter TROILUS
Shakespeare,Enter TROILUS
Shakespeare,Enter TROILUS
Shakespeare,Enter TROILUS
Shakespeare,Enter TROILUS
Shakespeare,"How now, how now!"
Shakespeare,"Sirrah, walk off."
Shakespeare,Have you seen my cousin?
Shakespeare,"No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,"
Shakespeare,Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
Shakespeare,"Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,"
Shakespeare,And give me swift transportance to those fields
Shakespeare,Where I may wallow in the lily-beds
Shakespeare,"Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,"
Shakespeare,From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
Shakespeare,And fly with me to Cressid!
Shakespeare,"Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight."
Shakespeare,"I am giddy, expectation whirls me round."
Shakespeare,The imaginary relish is so sweet
Shakespeare,"That it enchants my sense: what will it be,"
Shakespeare,When that the watery palate tastes indeed
Shakespeare,"Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,"
Shakespeare,"Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,"
Shakespeare,"Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,"
Shakespeare,For the capacity of my ruder powers:
Shakespeare,"I fear it much, and I do fear besides,"
Shakespeare,"That I shall lose distinction in my joys,"
Shakespeare,"As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps"
Shakespeare,The enemy flying.
Shakespeare,Re-enter PANDARUS
Shakespeare,Re-enter PANDARUS
Shakespeare,"She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you"
Shakespeare,"must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches"
Shakespeare,"her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a"
Shakespeare,sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest
Shakespeare,villain: she fetches her breath as short as a
Shakespeare,new-ta'en sparrow.
Shakespeare,Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:
Shakespeare,"My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse,"
Shakespeare,"And all my powers do their bestowing lose,"
Shakespeare,Like vassalage at unawares encountering
Shakespeare,The eye of majesty.
Shakespeare,Re-enter PANDARUS with CRESSIDA
Shakespeare,"Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby."
Shakespeare,Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that
Shakespeare,"you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?"
Shakespeare,"you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?"
Shakespeare,"Come your ways, come your ways, an you draw backward,"
Shakespeare,we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to
Shakespeare,"her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your"
Shakespeare,"picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend"
Shakespeare,"daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner."
Shakespeare,"So, so, rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!"
Shakespeare,"a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter, the air"
Shakespeare,"is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere"
Shakespeare,"I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the"
Shakespeare,"ducks i' the river: go to, go to."
Shakespeare,"You have bereft me of all words, lady."
Shakespeare,"Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll"
Shakespeare,"bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your"
Shakespeare,"activity in question. What, billing again? Here's"
Shakespeare,'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--
Shakespeare,"Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire."
Shakespeare,"Will you walk in, my lord?"
Shakespeare,"Will you walk in, my lord?"
Shakespeare,"O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!"
Shakespeare,"Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!"
Shakespeare,What should they grant? what makes this pretty
Shakespeare,abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet
Shakespeare,lady in the fountain of our love?
Shakespeare,"More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes."
Shakespeare,"Fears make devils of cherubims, they never see truly."
Shakespeare,"Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer"
Shakespeare,footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to
Shakespeare,fear the worst oft cures the worse.
Shakespeare,"O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's"
Shakespeare,pageant there is presented no monster.
Shakespeare,Nor nothing monstrous neither?
Shakespeare,"Nothing, but our undertakings, when we vow to weep"
Shakespeare,"seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers, thinking"
Shakespeare,it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
Shakespeare,enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.
Shakespeare,"This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will"
Shakespeare,"is infinite and the execution confined, that the"
Shakespeare,desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.
Shakespeare,They say all lovers swear more performance than they
Shakespeare,are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
Shakespeare,"perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and"
Shakespeare,discharging less than the tenth part of one. They
Shakespeare,"that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,"
Shakespeare,are they not monsters?
Shakespeare,Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we
Shakespeare,"are tasted, allow us as we prove, our head shall go"
Shakespeare,bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion
Shakespeare,shall have a praise in present: we will not name
Shakespeare,"desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition"
Shakespeare,shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus
Shakespeare,shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst
Shakespeare,"shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can"
Shakespeare,speak truest not truer than Troilus.
Shakespeare,"What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?"
Shakespeare,"Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you."
Shakespeare,"I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,"
Shakespeare,you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he
Shakespeare,"flinch, chide me for it."
Shakespeare,"You know now your hostages, your uncle's word and my"
Shakespeare,firm faith.
Shakespeare,"Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,"
Shakespeare,"though they be long ere they are wooed, they are"
Shakespeare,"constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you,"
Shakespeare,they'll stick where they are thrown.
Shakespeare,"Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart."
Shakespeare,"Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day"
Shakespeare,For many weary months.
Shakespeare,Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
Shakespeare,"Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,"
Shakespeare,With the first glance that ever--pardon me--
Shakespeare,"If I confess much, you will play the tyrant."
Shakespeare,"I love you now, but not, till now, so much"
Shakespeare,"But I might master it: in faith, I lie,"
Shakespeare,"My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown"
Shakespeare,"Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!"
Shakespeare,"Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,"
Shakespeare,When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
Shakespeare,"But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not,"
Shakespeare,"And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,"
Shakespeare,Or that we women had men's privilege
Shakespeare,"Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,"
Shakespeare,For in this rapture I shall surely speak
Shakespeare,"The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,"
Shakespeare,"Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws"
Shakespeare,My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.
Shakespeare,"And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence."
Shakespeare,"Pretty, i' faith."
Shakespeare,"My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me,"
Shakespeare,"'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:"
Shakespeare,I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?
Shakespeare,"For this time will I take my leave, my lord."
Shakespeare,"Your leave, sweet Cressid!"
Shakespeare,"Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--"
Shakespeare,"Pray you, content you."
Shakespeare,"What offends you, lady?"
Shakespeare,"Sir, mine own company."
Shakespeare,You cannot shun Yourself.
Shakespeare,Let me go and try:
Shakespeare,"I have a kind of self resides with you,"
Shakespeare,"But an unkind self, that itself will leave,"
Shakespeare,To be another's fool. I would be gone:
Shakespeare,Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.
Shakespeare,Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.
Shakespeare,"Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love,"
Shakespeare,"And fell so roundly to a large confession,"
Shakespeare,"To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,"
Shakespeare,"Or else you love not, for to be wise and love"
Shakespeare,"Exceeds man's might, that dwells with gods above."
Shakespeare,O that I thought it could be in a woman--
Shakespeare,"As, if it can, I will presume in you--"
Shakespeare,"To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love,"
Shakespeare,"To keep her constancy in plight and youth,"
Shakespeare,"Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind"
Shakespeare,That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
Shakespeare,"Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,"
Shakespeare,That my integrity and truth to you
Shakespeare,Might be affronted with the match and weight
Shakespeare,"Of such a winnow'd purity in love,"
Shakespeare,"How were I then uplifted! but, alas!"
Shakespeare,I am as true as truth's simplicity
Shakespeare,And simpler than the infancy of truth.
Shakespeare,In that I'll war with you.
Shakespeare,"O virtuous fight,"
Shakespeare,When right with right wars who shall be most right!
Shakespeare,True swains in love shall in the world to come
Shakespeare,"Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,"
Shakespeare,"Full of protest, of oath and big compare,"
Shakespeare,"Want similes, truth tired with iteration,"
Shakespeare,"As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,"
Shakespeare,"As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,"
Shakespeare,"As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,"
Shakespeare,"Yet, after all comparisons of truth,"
Shakespeare,"As truth's authentic author to be cited,"
Shakespeare,"'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,"
Shakespeare,And sanctify the numbers.
Shakespeare,Prophet may you be!
Shakespeare,"If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,"
Shakespeare,"When time is old and hath forgot itself,"
Shakespeare,"When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,"
Shakespeare,"And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,"
Shakespeare,And mighty states characterless are grated
Shakespeare,"To dusty nothing, yet let memory,"
Shakespeare,"From false to false, among false maids in love,"
Shakespeare,Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false
Shakespeare,"As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,"
Shakespeare,"As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,"
Shakespeare,"Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'"
Shakespeare,"'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,"
Shakespeare,'As false as Cressid.'
Shakespeare,"Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it, I'll be the"
Shakespeare,"witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's."
Shakespeare,"If ever you prove false one to another, since I have"
Shakespeare,"taken such pains to bring you together, let all"
Shakespeare,pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end
Shakespeare,"after my name, call them all Pandars, let all"
Shakespeare,"constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,"
Shakespeare,"and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen."
Shakespeare,Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a
Shakespeare,"bed, which bed, because it shall not speak of your"
Shakespeare,"pretty encounters, press it to death: away!"
Shakespeare,And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here
Shakespeare,"Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!"
Shakespeare,"Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX, MENELAUS, and CALCHAS"
Shakespeare,"Now, princes, for the service I have done you,"
Shakespeare,The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
Shakespeare,To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
Shakespeare,"That, through the sight I bear in things to love,"
Shakespeare,"I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,"
Shakespeare,"Incurr'd a traitor's name, exposed myself,"
Shakespeare,"From certain and possess'd conveniences,"
Shakespeare,"To doubtful fortunes, sequestering from me all"
Shakespeare,"That time, acquaintance, custom and condition"
Shakespeare,"Made tame and most familiar to my nature,"
Shakespeare,"And here, to do you service, am become"
Shakespeare,"As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:"
Shakespeare,"I do beseech you, as in way of taste,"
Shakespeare,"To give me now a little benefit,"
Shakespeare,"Out of those many register'd in promise,"
Shakespeare,"Which, you say, live to come in my behalf."
Shakespeare,"What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand."
Shakespeare,"You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,"
Shakespeare,Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
Shakespeare,Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
Shakespeare,"Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,"
Shakespeare,"Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,"
Shakespeare,"I know, is such a wrest in their affairs"
Shakespeare,"That their negotiations all must slack,"
Shakespeare,"Wanting his manage, and they will almost"
Shakespeare,"Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,"
Shakespeare,"In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,"
Shakespeare,"And he shall buy my daughter, and her presence"
Shakespeare,"Shall quite strike off all service I have done,"
Shakespeare,In most accepted pain.
Shakespeare,"Let Diomedes bear him,"
Shakespeare,And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
Shakespeare,"What he requests of us. Good Diomed,"
Shakespeare,Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
Shakespeare,Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
Shakespeare,Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.
Shakespeare,"This shall I undertake, and 'tis a burden"
Shakespeare,Which I am proud to bear.
Shakespeare,Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS
Shakespeare,"Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent"
Shakespeare,Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:
Shakespeare,"Please it our general to pass strangely by him,"
Shakespeare,"As if he were forgot, and, princes all,"
Shakespeare,Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:
Shakespeare,I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
Shakespeare,Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:
Shakespeare,"If so, I have derision medicinable,"
Shakespeare,"To use between your strangeness and his pride,"
Shakespeare,Which his own will shall have desire to drink:
Shakespeare,It may be good: pride hath no other glass
Shakespeare,"To show itself but pride, for supple knees"
Shakespeare,Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
Shakespeare,"We'll execute your purpose, and put on"
Shakespeare,A form of strangeness as we pass along:
Shakespeare,"So do each lord, and either greet him not,"
Shakespeare,"Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more"
Shakespeare,Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.
Shakespeare,"What, comes the general to speak with me?"
Shakespeare,"You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy."
Shakespeare,What says Achilles? would he aught with us?
Shakespeare,"Would you, my lord, aught with the general?"
Shakespeare,The better.
Shakespeare,Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR
Shakespeare,"Good day, good day."
Shakespeare,How do you? how do you?
Shakespeare,"What, does the cuckold scorn me?"
Shakespeare,"How now, Patroclus!"
Shakespeare,"Good morrow, Ajax."
Shakespeare,Ha?
Shakespeare,"Ay, and good next day too."
Shakespeare,What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
Shakespeare,They pass by strangely: they were used to bend
Shakespeare,"To send their smiles before them to Achilles,"
Shakespeare,To come as humbly as they used to creep
Shakespeare,To holy altars.
Shakespeare,"What, am I poor of late?"
Shakespeare,"'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,"
Shakespeare,Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
Shakespeare,He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
Shakespeare,"As feel in his own fall, for men, like butterflies,"
Shakespeare,"Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,"
Shakespeare,"And not a man, for being simply man,"
Shakespeare,"Hath any honour, but honour for those honours"
Shakespeare,"That are without him, as place, riches, favour,"
Shakespeare,Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
Shakespeare,"Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,"
Shakespeare,"The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,"
Shakespeare,Do one pluck down another and together
Shakespeare,Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
Shakespeare,Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
Shakespeare,"At ample point all that I did possess,"
Shakespeare,"Save these men's looks, who do, methinks, find out"
Shakespeare,Something not worth in me such rich beholding
Shakespeare,"As they have often given. Here is Ulysses,"
Shakespeare,I'll interrupt his reading.
Shakespeare,How now Ulysses!
Shakespeare,"Now, great Thetis' son!"
Shakespeare,What are you reading?
Shakespeare,A strange fellow here
Shakespeare,"Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,"
Shakespeare,"How much in having, or without or in,"
Shakespeare,"Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,"
Shakespeare,"Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection,"
Shakespeare,As when his virtues shining upon others
Shakespeare,Heat them and they retort that heat again
Shakespeare,To the first giver.'
Shakespeare,"This is not strange, Ulysses."
Shakespeare,The beauty that is borne here in the face
Shakespeare,"The bearer knows not, but commends itself"
Shakespeare,"To others' eyes, nor doth the eye itself,"
Shakespeare,"That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,"
Shakespeare,"Not going from itself, but eye to eye opposed"
Shakespeare,"Salutes each other with each other's form,"
Shakespeare,"For speculation turns not to itself,"
Shakespeare,Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
Shakespeare,Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
Shakespeare,"I do not strain at the position,--"
Shakespeare,"It is familiar,--but at the author's drift,"
Shakespeare,"Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves"
Shakespeare,"That no man is the lord of any thing,"
Shakespeare,"Though in and of him there be much consisting,"
Shakespeare,Till he communicate his parts to others:
Shakespeare,Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
Shakespeare,Till he behold them form'd in the applause
Shakespeare,"Where they're extended, who, like an arch,"
Shakespeare,reverberates
Shakespeare,"The voice again, or, like a gate of steel"
Shakespeare,"Fronting the sun, receives and renders back"
Shakespeare,"His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this,"
Shakespeare,And apprehended here immediately
Shakespeare,The unknown Ajax.
Shakespeare,"Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,"
Shakespeare,"That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are"
Shakespeare,Most abject in regard and dear in use!
Shakespeare,What things again most dear in the esteem
Shakespeare,And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
Shakespeare,An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
Shakespeare,"Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,"
Shakespeare,While some men leave to do!
Shakespeare,"How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,"
Shakespeare,Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
Shakespeare,"How one man eats into another's pride,"
Shakespeare,While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
Shakespeare,"To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already"
Shakespeare,"They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,"
Shakespeare,As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
Shakespeare,And great Troy shrieking.
Shakespeare,"I do believe it, for they pass'd by me"
Shakespeare,"As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me"
Shakespeare,"Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?"
Shakespeare,"Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,"
Shakespeare,"Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,"
Shakespeare,A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
Shakespeare,"Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devour'd"
Shakespeare,"As fast as they are made, forgot as soon"
Shakespeare,"As done: perseverance, dear my lord,"
Shakespeare,Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
Shakespeare,"Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail"
Shakespeare,"In monumental mockery. Take the instant way,"
Shakespeare,"For honour travels in a strait so narrow,"
Shakespeare,"Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path,"
Shakespeare,For emulation hath a thousand sons
Shakespeare,"That one by one pursue: if you give way,"
Shakespeare,"Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,"
Shakespeare,"Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by"
Shakespeare,"And leave you hindmost,"
Shakespeare,"Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,"
Shakespeare,"Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,"
Shakespeare,"O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,"
Shakespeare,"Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours,"
Shakespeare,For time is like a fashionable host
Shakespeare,"That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,"
Shakespeare,"And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,"
Shakespeare,"Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,"
Shakespeare,"And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not"
Shakespeare,virtue seek
Shakespeare,"Remuneration for the thing it was,"
Shakespeare,"For beauty, wit,"
Shakespeare,"High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,"
Shakespeare,"Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all"
Shakespeare,To envious and calumniating time.
Shakespeare,"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,"
Shakespeare,"That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,"
Shakespeare,"Though they are made and moulded of things past,"
Shakespeare,And give to dust that is a little gilt
Shakespeare,More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
Shakespeare,The present eye praises the present object.
Shakespeare,"Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,"
Shakespeare,"That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,"
Shakespeare,Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
Shakespeare,"Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,"
Shakespeare,"And still it might, and yet it may again,"
Shakespeare,If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
Shakespeare,"And case thy reputation in thy tent,"
Shakespeare,"Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,"
Shakespeare,Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
Shakespeare,And drave great Mars to faction.
Shakespeare,Of this my privacy
Shakespeare,I have strong reasons.
Shakespeare,But 'gainst your privacy
Shakespeare,The reasons are more potent and heroical:
Shakespeare,"'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love"
Shakespeare,With one of Priam's daughters.
Shakespeare,Ha! known!
Shakespeare,Is that a wonder?
Shakespeare,The providence that's in a watchful state
Shakespeare,"Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,"
Shakespeare,"Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,"
Shakespeare,"Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,"
Shakespeare,Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
Shakespeare,There is a mystery--with whom relation
Shakespeare,"Durst never meddle--in the soul of state,"
Shakespeare,Which hath an operation more divine
Shakespeare,Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
Shakespeare,All the commerce that you have had with Troy
Shakespeare,"As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord,"
Shakespeare,And better would it fit Achilles much
Shakespeare,To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
Shakespeare,"But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,"
Shakespeare,"When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,"
Shakespeare,"And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,"
Shakespeare,"'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,"
Shakespeare,But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
Shakespeare,"Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak,"
Shakespeare,The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
Shakespeare,"To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:"
Shakespeare,A woman impudent and mannish grown
Shakespeare,Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
Shakespeare,"In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this,"
Shakespeare,They think my little stomach to the war
Shakespeare,And your great love to me restrains you thus:
Shakespeare,"Sweet, rouse yourself, and the weak wanton Cupid"
Shakespeare,"Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,"
Shakespeare,"And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,"
Shakespeare,Be shook to air.
Shakespeare,Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
Shakespeare,"Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him."
Shakespeare,I see my reputation is at stake
Shakespeare,My fame is shrewdly gored.
Shakespeare,"O, then, beware,"
Shakespeare,Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
Shakespeare,Omission to do what is necessary
Shakespeare,"Seals a commission to a blank of danger,"
Shakespeare,"And danger, like an ague, subtly taints"
Shakespeare,Even then when we sit idly in the sun.
Shakespeare,"Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:"
Shakespeare,I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
Shakespeare,To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
Shakespeare,"To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,"
Shakespeare,"An appetite that I am sick withal,"
Shakespeare,"To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,"
Shakespeare,"To talk with him and to behold his visage,"
Shakespeare,Even to my full of view.
Shakespeare,Enter THERSITES
Shakespeare,Enter THERSITES
Shakespeare,A labour saved!
Shakespeare,A wonder!
Shakespeare,"Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself."
Shakespeare,How so?
Shakespeare,"He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so"
Shakespeare,prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
Shakespeare,raves in saying nothing.
Shakespeare,How can that be?
Shakespeare,How can that be?
Shakespeare,"Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride"
Shakespeare,and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
Shakespeare,arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
Shakespeare,"bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should"
Shakespeare,"say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out,'"
Shakespeare,"and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire"
Shakespeare,"in a flint, which will not show without knocking."
Shakespeare,"The man's undone forever, for if Hector break not his"
Shakespeare,"neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in"
Shakespeare,"vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,"
Shakespeare,"Ajax,' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think"
Shakespeare,you of this man that takes me for the general? He's
Shakespeare,"grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster."
Shakespeare,A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both
Shakespeare,"sides, like a leather jerkin."
Shakespeare,"Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites."
Shakespeare,"Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody, he professes not"
Shakespeare,"answering: speaking is for beggars, he wears his"
Shakespeare,tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let
Shakespeare,"Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the"
Shakespeare,pageant of Ajax.
Shakespeare,"To him, Patroclus, tell him I humbly desire the"
Shakespeare,valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
Shakespeare,"to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure"
Shakespeare,safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous
Shakespeare,and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured
Shakespeare,"captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,"
Shakespeare,et cetera. Do this.
Shakespeare,Jove bless great Ajax!
Shakespeare,"I come from the worthy Achilles,--"
Shakespeare,"Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--"
Shakespeare,And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.
Shakespeare,Agamemnon!
Shakespeare,What say you to't?
Shakespeare,"God b' wi' you, with all my heart."
Shakespeare,"Your answer, sir."
Shakespeare,"Your answer, sir."
Shakespeare,"If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will"
Shakespeare,"go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me"
Shakespeare,ere he has me.
Shakespeare,"Fare you well, with all my heart."
Shakespeare,"Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?"
Shakespeare,"No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in"
Shakespeare,"him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know"
Shakespeare,"not, but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo"
Shakespeare,get his sinews to make catlings on.
Shakespeare,"Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight."
Shakespeare,"Let me bear another to his horse, for that's the more"
Shakespeare,capable creature.
Shakespeare,"My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd,"
Shakespeare,And I myself see not the bottom of it.
Shakespeare,Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
Shakespeare,Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
Shakespeare,"Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,"
Shakespeare,that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a
Shakespeare,tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Troy. A street.
Shakespeare,"Enter, from one side, AENEAS, and Servant with a  torch, from the other, PARIS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, DIOMEDES, and others, with torches"
Shakespeare,"See, ho! who is that there?"
Shakespeare,It is the Lord AEneas.
Shakespeare,Is the prince there in person?
Shakespeare,Had I so good occasion to lie long
Shakespeare,"As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business"
Shakespeare,Should rob my bed-mate of my company.
Shakespeare,"That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas."
Shakespeare,"A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--"
Shakespeare,"Witness the process of your speech, wherein"
Shakespeare,"You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,"
Shakespeare,Did haunt you in the field.
Shakespeare,"Health to you, valiant sir,"
Shakespeare,"During all question of the gentle truce,"
Shakespeare,"But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance"
Shakespeare,As heart can think or courage execute.
Shakespeare,The one and other Diomed embraces.
Shakespeare,"Our bloods are now in calm, and, so long, health!"
Shakespeare,"But when contention and occasion meet,"
Shakespeare,"By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life"
Shakespeare,"With all my force, pursuit and policy."
Shakespeare,"And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly"
Shakespeare,"With his face backward. In humane gentleness,"
Shakespeare,"Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,"
Shakespeare,"Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,"
Shakespeare,No man alive can love in such a sort
Shakespeare,The thing he means to kill more excellently.
Shakespeare,"We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,"
Shakespeare,"If to my sword his fate be not the glory,"
Shakespeare,A thousand complete courses of the sun!
Shakespeare,"But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,"
Shakespeare,"With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!"
Shakespeare,We know each other well.
Shakespeare,"We do, and long to know each other worse."
Shakespeare,"This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,"
Shakespeare,"The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of."
Shakespeare,"What business, lord, so early?"
Shakespeare,"I was sent for to the king, but why, I know not."
Shakespeare,His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
Shakespeare,"To Calchas' house, and there to render him,"
Shakespeare,"For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:"
Shakespeare,"Let's have your company, or, if you please,"
Shakespeare,Haste there before us: I constantly do think--
Shakespeare,"Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--"
Shakespeare,My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
Shakespeare,Rouse him and give him note of our approach.
Shakespeare,With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
Shakespeare,We shall be much unwelcome.
Shakespeare,That I assure you:
Shakespeare,Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
Shakespeare,Than Cressid borne from Troy.
Shakespeare,"There is no help,"
Shakespeare,The bitter disposition of the time
Shakespeare,"Will have it so. On, lord, we'll follow you."
Shakespeare,"Good morrow, all."
Shakespeare,Exit with Servant
Shakespeare,"And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,"
Shakespeare,"Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,"
Shakespeare,"Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,"
Shakespeare,Myself or Menelaus?
Shakespeare,Both alike:
Shakespeare,"He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,"
Shakespeare,"Not making any scruple of her soilure,"
Shakespeare,"With such a hell of pain and world of charge,"
Shakespeare,"And you as well to keep her, that defend her,"
Shakespeare,"Not palating the taste of her dishonour,"
Shakespeare,With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:
Shakespeare,"He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up"
Shakespeare,"The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece,"
Shakespeare,"You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins"
Shakespeare,Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:
Shakespeare,"Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more,"
Shakespeare,"But he as he, the heavier for a whore."
Shakespeare,You are too bitter to your countrywoman.
Shakespeare,"She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:"
Shakespeare,For every false drop in her bawdy veins
Shakespeare,"A Grecian's life hath sunk, for every scruple"
Shakespeare,"Of her contaminated carrion weight,"
Shakespeare,"A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,"
Shakespeare,She hath not given so many good words breath
Shakespeare,As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.
Shakespeare,"Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,"
Shakespeare,Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:
Shakespeare,"But we in silence hold this virtue well,"
Shakespeare,We'll but commend what we intend to sell.
Shakespeare,Here lies our way.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. The same. Court of Pandarus' house.
Shakespeare,Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA
Shakespeare,"Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold."
Shakespeare,"Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down,"
Shakespeare,He shall unbolt the gates.
Shakespeare,"Trouble him not,"
Shakespeare,"To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,"
Shakespeare,And give as soft attachment to thy senses
Shakespeare,As infants' empty of all thought!
Shakespeare,"Good morrow, then."
Shakespeare,"I prithee now, to bed."
Shakespeare,Are you a-weary of me?
Shakespeare,"O Cressida! but that the busy day,"
Shakespeare,"Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,"
Shakespeare,"And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,"
Shakespeare,I would not from thee.
Shakespeare,Night hath been too brief.
Shakespeare,Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays
Shakespeare,"As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love"
Shakespeare,With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
Shakespeare,"You will catch cold, and curse me."
Shakespeare,"Prithee, tarry:"
Shakespeare,You men will never tarry.
Shakespeare,"O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,"
Shakespeare,And then you would have tarried. Hark!
Shakespeare,there's one up.
Shakespeare,"[Within]  What, 's all the doors open here?"
Shakespeare,It is your uncle.
Shakespeare,A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:
Shakespeare,I shall have such a life!
Shakespeare,"How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, you"
Shakespeare,maid! where's my cousin Cressid?
Shakespeare,"Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!"
Shakespeare,"You bring me to do, and then you flout me too."
Shakespeare,To do what? to do what? let her say
Shakespeare,what: what have I brought you to do?
Shakespeare,"Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,"
Shakespeare,Nor suffer others.
Shakespeare,"Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!"
Shakespeare,"hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty"
Shakespeare,"man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!"
Shakespeare,Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!
Shakespeare,"Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see."
Shakespeare,"My lord, come you again into my chamber:"
Shakespeare,"You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily."
Shakespeare,"Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing."
Shakespeare,"How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:"
Shakespeare,I would not for half Troy have you seen here.
Shakespeare,Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA
Shakespeare,Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat
Shakespeare,down the door? How now! what's the matter?
Shakespeare,"Good morrow, lord, good morrow."
Shakespeare,"Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,"
Shakespeare,I knew you not: what news with you so early?
Shakespeare,Is not Prince Troilus here?
Shakespeare,Here! what should he do here?
Shakespeare,"Come, he is here, my lord, do not deny him:"
Shakespeare,It doth import him much to speak with me.
Shakespeare,"Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll"
Shakespeare,"be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What"
Shakespeare,should he do here?
Shakespeare,"Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong"
Shakespeare,"ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be"
Shakespeare,"false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go"
Shakespeare,"fetch him hither, go."
Shakespeare,Re-enter TROILUS
Shakespeare,Re-enter TROILUS
Shakespeare,"My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,"
Shakespeare,My matter is so rash: there is at hand
Shakespeare,"Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,"
Shakespeare,"The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor"
Shakespeare,"Deliver'd to us, and for him forthwith,"
Shakespeare,"Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,"
Shakespeare,We must give up to Diomedes' hand
Shakespeare,The Lady Cressida.
Shakespeare,Is it so concluded?
Shakespeare,By Priam and the general state of Troy:
Shakespeare,They are at hand and ready to effect it.
Shakespeare,How my achievements mock me!
Shakespeare,"I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,"
Shakespeare,"We met by chance, you did not find me here."
Shakespeare,"Good, good, my lord, the secrets of nature"
Shakespeare,Have not more gift in taciturnity.
Shakespeare,Exeunt TROILUS and AENEAS
Shakespeare,Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil
Shakespeare,take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a
Shakespeare,plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!
Shakespeare,Re-enter CRESSIDA
Shakespeare,Re-enter CRESSIDA
Shakespeare,How now! what's the matter? who was here?
Shakespeare,"Ah, ah!"
Shakespeare,Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!
Shakespeare,"Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?"
Shakespeare,Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!
Shakespeare,O the gods! what's the matter?
Shakespeare,"Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been"
Shakespeare,"born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor"
Shakespeare,gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!
Shakespeare,"Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,"
Shakespeare,"Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone, thou"
Shakespeare,"art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,"
Shakespeare,"and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death,"
Shakespeare,"'twill be his bane, he cannot bear it."
Shakespeare,O you immortal gods! I will not go.
Shakespeare,Thou must.
Shakespeare,"I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father,"
Shakespeare,"I know no touch of consanguinity,"
Shakespeare,"No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me"
Shakespeare,As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!
Shakespeare,"Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,"
Shakespeare,"If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,"
Shakespeare,"Do to this body what extremes you can,"
Shakespeare,But the strong base and building of my love
Shakespeare,"Is as the very centre of the earth,"
Shakespeare,"Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--"
Shakespeare,"Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,"
Shakespeare,Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
Shakespeare,With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.
Shakespeare,SCENE III. The same. Street before Pandarus' house.
Shakespeare,"Enter PARIS, TROILUS, AENEAS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, and DIOMEDES"
Shakespeare,"It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd"
Shakespeare,Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
Shakespeare,"Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,"
Shakespeare,"Tell you the lady what she is to do,"
Shakespeare,And haste her to the purpose.
Shakespeare,"Walk into her house,"
Shakespeare,I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:
Shakespeare,"And to his hand when I deliver her,"
Shakespeare,"Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus"
Shakespeare,A priest there offering to it his own heart.
Shakespeare,"I know what 'tis to love,"
Shakespeare,"And would, as I shall pity, I could help!"
Shakespeare,"Please you walk in, my lords."
Shakespeare,SCENE IV. The same. Pandarus' house.
Shakespeare,Enter PANDARUS and CRESSIDA
Shakespeare,"Be moderate, be moderate."
Shakespeare,Why tell you me of moderation?
Shakespeare,"The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,"
Shakespeare,And violenteth in a sense as strong
Shakespeare,As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?
Shakespeare,"If I could temporize with my affection,"
Shakespeare,"Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,"
Shakespeare,The like allayment could I give my grief.
Shakespeare,"My love admits no qualifying dross,"
Shakespeare,"No more my grief, in such a precious loss."
Shakespeare,"Here, here, here he comes."
Shakespeare,"Ah, sweet ducks!"
Shakespeare,O Troilus! Troilus!
Shakespeare,What a pair of spectacles is here!
Shakespeare,"Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,"
Shakespeare,"'--O heart, heavy heart,"
Shakespeare,Why sigh'st thou without breaking?
Shakespeare,"where he answers again,"
Shakespeare,'Because thou canst not ease thy smart
Shakespeare,By friendship nor by speaking.'
Shakespeare,There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away
Shakespeare,"nothing, for we may live to have need of such a"
Shakespeare,"verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?"
Shakespeare,"Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,"
Shakespeare,"That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,"
Shakespeare,More bright in zeal than the devotion which
Shakespeare,"Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me."
Shakespeare,Have the gods envy?
Shakespeare,"Ay, ay, ay, ay, 'tis too plain a case."
Shakespeare,And is it true that I must go from Troy?
Shakespeare,A hateful truth.
Shakespeare,"What, and from Troilus too?"
Shakespeare,From Troy and Troilus.
Shakespeare,"And suddenly, where injury of chance"
Shakespeare,"Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by"
Shakespeare,"All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips"
Shakespeare,"Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents"
Shakespeare,"Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows"
Shakespeare,Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:
Shakespeare,"We two, that with so many thousand sighs"
Shakespeare,"Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves"
Shakespeare,With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
Shakespeare,Injurious time now with a robber's haste
Shakespeare,"Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:"
Shakespeare,"As many farewells as be stars in heaven,"
Shakespeare,"With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,"
Shakespeare,"He fumbles up into a lose adieu,"
Shakespeare,"And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,"
Shakespeare,Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
Shakespeare,"[Within]  My lord, is the lady ready?"
Shakespeare,Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so
Shakespeare,Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.
Shakespeare,"Bid them have patience, she shall come anon."
Shakespeare,"Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or"
Shakespeare,my heart will be blown up by the root.
Shakespeare,I must then to the Grecians?
Shakespeare,No remedy.
Shakespeare,No remedy.
Shakespeare,A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
Shakespeare,"Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--"
Shakespeare,I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?
Shakespeare,"Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,"
Shakespeare,For it is parting from us:
Shakespeare,"I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,"
Shakespeare,"For I will throw my glove to Death himself,"
Shakespeare,That there's no maculation in thy heart:
Shakespeare,"But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in"
Shakespeare,"My sequent protestation, be thou true,"
Shakespeare,And I will see thee.
Shakespeare,"O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers"
Shakespeare,As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.
Shakespeare,And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.
Shakespeare,And you this glove. When shall I see you?
Shakespeare,"I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,"
Shakespeare,To give thee nightly visitation.
Shakespeare,But yet be true.
Shakespeare,O heavens! 'be true' again!
Shakespeare,"Hear while I speak it, love:"
Shakespeare,"The Grecian youths are full of quality,"
Shakespeare,"They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,"
Shakespeare,Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:
Shakespeare,"How novelty may move, and parts with person,"
Shakespeare,"Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--"
Shakespeare,"Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--"
Shakespeare,Makes me afeard.
Shakespeare,O heavens! you love me not.
Shakespeare,"Die I a villain, then!"
Shakespeare,In this I do not call your faith in question
Shakespeare,"So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,"
Shakespeare,"Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,"
Shakespeare,"Nor play at subtle games, fair virtues all,"
Shakespeare,To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:
Shakespeare,But I can tell that in each grace of these
Shakespeare,There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
Shakespeare,That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.
Shakespeare,Do you think I will?
Shakespeare,But something may be done that we will not:
Shakespeare,"And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,"
Shakespeare,"When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,"
Shakespeare,Presuming on their changeful potency.
Shakespeare,"[Within]  Nay, good my lord,--"
Shakespeare,"Come, kiss, and let us part."
Shakespeare,[Within]  Brother Troilus!
Shakespeare,"Good brother, come you hither,"
Shakespeare,And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.
Shakespeare,"My lord, will you be true?"
Shakespeare,"Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:"
Shakespeare,"Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,"
Shakespeare,"I with great truth catch mere simplicity,"
Shakespeare,"Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,"
Shakespeare,With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
Shakespeare,Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
Shakespeare,"Is 'plain and true,' there's all the reach of it."
Shakespeare,"Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS, and DIOMEDES"
Shakespeare,"Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady"
Shakespeare,Which for Antenor we deliver you:
Shakespeare,"At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,"
Shakespeare,And by the way possess thee what she is.
Shakespeare,"Entreat her fair, and, by my soul, fair Greek,"
Shakespeare,"If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,"
Shakespeare,Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe
Shakespeare,As Priam is in Ilion.
Shakespeare,"Fair Lady Cressid,"
Shakespeare,"So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:"
Shakespeare,"The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,"
Shakespeare,"Pleads your fair usage, and to Diomed"
Shakespeare,"You shall be mistress, and command him wholly."
Shakespeare,"Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,"
Shakespeare,To shame the zeal of my petition to thee
Shakespeare,"In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,"
Shakespeare,She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises
Shakespeare,As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.
Shakespeare,"I charge thee use her well, even for my charge,"
Shakespeare,"For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,"
Shakespeare,"Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,"
Shakespeare,I'll cut thy throat.
Shakespeare,"O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:"
Shakespeare,"Let me be privileged by my place and message,"
Shakespeare,"To be a speaker free, when I am hence"
Shakespeare,"I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,"
Shakespeare,I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
Shakespeare,"She shall be prized, but that you say 'be't so,'"
Shakespeare,"I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'"
Shakespeare,"Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,"
Shakespeare,This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.
Shakespeare,"Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,"
Shakespeare,To our own selves bend we our needful talk.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt TROILUS, CRESSIDA, and DIOMEDES"
Shakespeare,Hark! Hector's trumpet.
Shakespeare,How have we spent this morning!
Shakespeare,"The prince must think me tardy and remiss,"
Shakespeare,That sore to ride before him to the field.
Shakespeare,"'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him."
Shakespeare,Let us make ready straight.
Shakespeare,"Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,"
Shakespeare,Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
Shakespeare,The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
Shakespeare,On his fair worth and single chivalry.
Shakespeare,SCENE V. The Grecian camp. Lists set out.
Shakespeare,"Enter AJAX, armed, AGAMEMNON, ACHILLES, PATROCLUS, MENELAUS, ULYSSES, NESTOR, and others"
Shakespeare,"Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,"
Shakespeare,Anticipating time with starting courage.
Shakespeare,"Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,"
Shakespeare,"Thou dreadful Ajax, that the appalled air"
Shakespeare,May pierce the head of the great combatant
Shakespeare,And hale him hither.
Shakespeare,"Thou, trumpet, there's my purse."
Shakespeare,"Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:"
Shakespeare,"Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek"
Shakespeare,Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:
Shakespeare,"Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood,"
Shakespeare,Thou blow'st for Hector.
Shakespeare,No trumpet answers.
Shakespeare,'Tis but early days.
Shakespeare,"Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?"
Shakespeare,"'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait,"
Shakespeare,He rises on the toe: that spirit of his
Shakespeare,In aspiration lifts him from the earth.
Shakespeare,"Enter DIOMEDES, with CRESSIDA"
Shakespeare,Is this the Lady Cressid?
Shakespeare,Even she.
Shakespeare,"Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady."
Shakespeare,Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
Shakespeare,"Yet is the kindness but particular,"
Shakespeare,'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
Shakespeare,And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
Shakespeare,So much for Nestor.
Shakespeare,"I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:"
Shakespeare,Achilles bids you welcome.
Shakespeare,I had good argument for kissing once.
Shakespeare,"But that's no argument for kissing now,"
Shakespeare,"For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,"
Shakespeare,And parted thus you and your argument.
Shakespeare,"O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!"
Shakespeare,For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.
Shakespeare,"The first was Menelaus' kiss, this, mine:"
Shakespeare,Patroclus kisses you.
Shakespeare,"O, this is trim!"
Shakespeare,Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
Shakespeare,"I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave."
Shakespeare,"In kissing, do you render or receive?"
Shakespeare,Both take and give.
Shakespeare,"I'll make my match to live,"
Shakespeare,"The kiss you take is better than you give,"
Shakespeare,Therefore no kiss.
Shakespeare,"I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one."
Shakespeare,"You're an odd man, give even or give none."
Shakespeare,"An odd man, lady! every man is odd."
Shakespeare,"No, Paris is not, for you know 'tis true,"
Shakespeare,"That you are odd, and he is even with you."
Shakespeare,You fillip me o' the head.
Shakespeare,"No, I'll be sworn."
Shakespeare,"It were no match, your nail against his horn."
Shakespeare,"May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?"
Shakespeare,You may.
Shakespeare,"Why, beg, then."
Shakespeare,"Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,"
Shakespeare,"When Helen is a maid again, and his."
Shakespeare,"I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due."
Shakespeare,"Never's my day, and then a kiss of you."
Shakespeare,"Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father."
Shakespeare,Exit with CRESSIDA
Shakespeare,A woman of quick sense.
Shakespeare,"Fie, fie upon her!"
Shakespeare,"There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,"
Shakespeare,"Nay, her foot speaks, her wanton spirits look out"
Shakespeare,At every joint and motive of her body.
Shakespeare,"O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,"
Shakespeare,"That give accosting welcome ere it comes,"
Shakespeare,And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
Shakespeare,To every ticklish reader! set them down
Shakespeare,For sluttish spoils of opportunity
Shakespeare,And daughters of the game.
Shakespeare,The Trojans' trumpet.
Shakespeare,Yonder comes the troop.
Shakespeare,"Enter HECTOR, armed, AENEAS, TROILUS, and other Trojans, with Attendants"
Shakespeare,"Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done"
Shakespeare,To him that victory commands? or do you purpose
Shakespeare,A victor shall be known? will you the knights
Shakespeare,Shall to the edge of all extremity
Shakespeare,"Pursue each other, or shall be divided"
Shakespeare,By any voice or order of the field?
Shakespeare,Hector bade ask.
Shakespeare,Which way would Hector have it?
Shakespeare,"He cares not, he'll obey conditions."
Shakespeare,"'Tis done like Hector, but securely done,"
Shakespeare,"A little proudly, and great deal misprizing"
Shakespeare,The knight opposed.
Shakespeare,"If not Achilles, sir,"
Shakespeare,"If not Achilles, nothing."
Shakespeare,"Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:"
Shakespeare,"In the extremity of great and little,"
Shakespeare,"Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector,"
Shakespeare,"The one almost as infinite as all,"
Shakespeare,"The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,"
Shakespeare,And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
Shakespeare,This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:
Shakespeare,"In love whereof, half Hector stays at home,"
Shakespeare,"Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek"
Shakespeare,"This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek."
Shakespeare,"A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you."
Shakespeare,Re-enter DIOMEDES
Shakespeare,"Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,"
Shakespeare,Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas
Shakespeare,"Consent upon the order of their fight,"
Shakespeare,"So be it, either to the uttermost,"
Shakespeare,Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
Shakespeare,Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
Shakespeare,AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists
Shakespeare,They are opposed already.
Shakespeare,What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?
Shakespeare,"The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,"
Shakespeare,"Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,"
Shakespeare,"Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue,"
Shakespeare,Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:
Shakespeare,"His heart and hand both open and both free,"
Shakespeare,"For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows,"
Shakespeare,"Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,"
Shakespeare,"Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath,"
Shakespeare,"Manly as Hector, but more dangerous,"
Shakespeare,For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
Shakespeare,"To tender objects, but he in heat of action"
Shakespeare,Is more vindicative than jealous love:
Shakespeare,"They call him Troilus, and on him erect"
Shakespeare,"A second hope, as fairly built as Hector."
Shakespeare,"Thus says AEneas, one that knows the youth"
Shakespeare,"Even to his inches, and with private soul"
Shakespeare,Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.
Shakespeare,Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight
Shakespeare,They are in action.
Shakespeare,"Now, Ajax, hold thine own!"
Shakespeare,"Hector, thou sleep'st,"
Shakespeare,Awake thee!
Shakespeare,"His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!"
Shakespeare,You must no more.
Shakespeare,Trumpets cease
Shakespeare,"Princes, enough, so please you."
Shakespeare,"I am not warm yet, let us fight again."
Shakespeare,As Hector pleases.
Shakespeare,"Why, then will I no more:"
Shakespeare,"Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,"
Shakespeare,"A cousin-german to great Priam's seed,"
Shakespeare,The obligation of our blood forbids
Shakespeare,A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
Shakespeare,Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
Shakespeare,"That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,"
Shakespeare,"And this is Trojan, the sinews of this leg"
Shakespeare,"All Greek, and this all Troy, my mother's blood"
Shakespeare,"Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister"
Shakespeare,"Bounds in my father's,' by Jove multipotent,"
Shakespeare,Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
Shakespeare,Wherein my sword had not impressure made
Shakespeare,Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay
Shakespeare,"That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,"
Shakespeare,"My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword"
Shakespeare,"Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:"
Shakespeare,"By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms,"
Shakespeare,Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
Shakespeare,"Cousin, all honour to thee!"
Shakespeare,"I thank thee, Hector"
Shakespeare,Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
Shakespeare,"I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence"
Shakespeare,A great addition earned in thy death.
Shakespeare,"Not Neoptolemus so mirable,"
Shakespeare,On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
Shakespeare,"Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself"
Shakespeare,A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
Shakespeare,"There is expectance here from both the sides,"
Shakespeare,What further you will do.
Shakespeare,"We'll answer it,"
Shakespeare,"The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell."
Shakespeare,If I might in entreaties find success--
Shakespeare,As seld I have the chance--I would desire
Shakespeare,My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
Shakespeare,"'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles"
Shakespeare,Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
Shakespeare,"AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,"
Shakespeare,And signify this loving interview
Shakespeare,"To the expecters of our Trojan part,"
Shakespeare,"Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin,"
Shakespeare,I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
Shakespeare,Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
Shakespeare,"The worthiest of them tell me name by name,"
Shakespeare,"But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes"
Shakespeare,Shall find him by his large and portly size.
Shakespeare,Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
Shakespeare,"That would be rid of such an enemy,"
Shakespeare,"But that's no welcome: understand more clear,"
Shakespeare,What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
Shakespeare,"And formless ruin of oblivion,"
Shakespeare,"But in this extant moment, faith and troth,"
Shakespeare,"Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,"
Shakespeare,"Bids thee, with most divine integrity,"
Shakespeare,"From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome."
Shakespeare,"I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon."
Shakespeare,"[To TROILUS]  My well-famed lord of Troy, no"
Shakespeare,less to you.
Shakespeare,Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:
Shakespeare,"You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither."
Shakespeare,Who must we answer?
Shakespeare,The noble Menelaus.
Shakespeare,"O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!"
Shakespeare,"Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath,"
Shakespeare,Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
Shakespeare,"She's well, but bade me not commend her to you."
Shakespeare,"Name her not now, sir, she's a deadly theme."
Shakespeare,"O, pardon, I offend."
Shakespeare,"I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft"
Shakespeare,Labouring for destiny make cruel way
Shakespeare,"Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,"
Shakespeare,"As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,"
Shakespeare,"Despising many forfeits and subduements,"
Shakespeare,"When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,"
Shakespeare,"Not letting it decline on the declined,"
Shakespeare,That I have said to some my standers by
Shakespeare,"'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'"
Shakespeare,"And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,"
Shakespeare,"When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,"
Shakespeare,"Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen,"
Shakespeare,"But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,"
Shakespeare,"I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,"
Shakespeare,"And once fought with him: he was a soldier good,"
Shakespeare,"But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,"
Shakespeare,"Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee,"
Shakespeare,"And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents."
Shakespeare,'Tis the old Nestor.
Shakespeare,"Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,"
Shakespeare,That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
Shakespeare,"Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee."
Shakespeare,"I would my arms could match thee in contention,"
Shakespeare,As they contend with thee in courtesy.
Shakespeare,I would they could.
Shakespeare,"By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow."
Shakespeare,"Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time."
Shakespeare,I wonder now how yonder city stands
Shakespeare,When we have here her base and pillar by us.
Shakespeare,"I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well."
Shakespeare,"Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,"
Shakespeare,Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
Shakespeare,"In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy."
Shakespeare,"Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:"
Shakespeare,"My prophecy is but half his journey yet,"
Shakespeare,"For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,"
Shakespeare,"Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,"
Shakespeare,Must kiss their own feet.
Shakespeare,I must not believe you:
Shakespeare,"There they stand yet, and modestly I think,"
Shakespeare,The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
Shakespeare,"A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,"
Shakespeare,"And that old common arbitrator, Time,"
Shakespeare,Will one day end it.
Shakespeare,So to him we leave it.
Shakespeare,"Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:"
Shakespeare,"After the general, I beseech you next"
Shakespeare,To feast with me and see me at my tent.
Shakespeare,"I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!"
Shakespeare,"Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee,"
Shakespeare,"I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,"
Shakespeare,And quoted joint by joint.
Shakespeare,Is this Achilles?
Shakespeare,I am Achilles.
Shakespeare,"Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee."
Shakespeare,Behold thy fill.
Shakespeare,"Nay, I have done already."
Shakespeare,"Thou art too brief: I will the second time,"
Shakespeare,"As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb."
Shakespeare,"O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er,"
Shakespeare,But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
Shakespeare,Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?
Shakespeare,"Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body"
Shakespeare,"Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?"
Shakespeare,That I may give the local wound a name
Shakespeare,And make distinct the very breach whereout
Shakespeare,"Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!"
Shakespeare,"It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,"
Shakespeare,To answer such a question: stand again:
Shakespeare,Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
Shakespeare,As to prenominate in nice conjecture
Shakespeare,Where thou wilt hit me dead?
Shakespeare,"I tell thee, yea."
Shakespeare,"Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,"
Shakespeare,"I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well,"
Shakespeare,"For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there,"
Shakespeare,"But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,"
Shakespeare,"I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er."
Shakespeare,"You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag,"
Shakespeare,"His insolence draws folly from my lips,"
Shakespeare,"But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,"
Shakespeare,Or may I never--
Shakespeare,"Do not chafe thee, cousin:"
Shakespeare,"And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,"
Shakespeare,Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
Shakespeare,You may have every day enough of Hector
Shakespeare,"If you have stomach, the general state, I fear,"
Shakespeare,Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
Shakespeare,"I pray you, let us see you in the field:"
Shakespeare,"We have had pelting wars, since you refused"
Shakespeare,The Grecians' cause.
Shakespeare,"Dost thou entreat me, Hector?"
Shakespeare,"To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death,"
Shakespeare,To-night all friends.
Shakespeare,Thy hand upon that match.
Shakespeare,"First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent,"
Shakespeare,"There in the full convive we: afterwards,"
Shakespeare,As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
Shakespeare,"Concur together, severally entreat him."
Shakespeare,"Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,"
Shakespeare,That this great soldier may his welcome know.
Shakespeare,Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSES
Shakespeare,"My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,"
Shakespeare,In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?
Shakespeare,"At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:"
Shakespeare,"There Diomed doth feast with him to-night,"
Shakespeare,"Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,"
Shakespeare,But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
Shakespeare,On the fair Cressid.
Shakespeare,"Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,"
Shakespeare,"After we part from Agamemnon's tent,"
Shakespeare,To bring me thither?
Shakespeare,"You shall command me, sir."
Shakespeare,"As gentle tell me, of what honour was"
Shakespeare,This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
Shakespeare,That wails her absence?
Shakespeare,"O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars"
Shakespeare,"A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?"
Shakespeare,"She was beloved, she loved, she is, and doth:"
Shakespeare,But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.
Shakespeare,"I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,"
Shakespeare,Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.
Shakespeare,"Patroclus, let us feast him to the height."
Shakespeare,Here comes Thersites.
Shakespeare,"How now, thou core of envy!"
Shakespeare,"Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?"
Shakespeare,"Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol"
Shakespeare,"of idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee."
Shakespeare,"From whence, fragment?"
Shakespeare,"Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy."
Shakespeare,Who keeps the tent now?
Shakespeare,"The surgeon's box, or the patient's wound."
Shakespeare,"Well said, adversity! and what need these tricks?"
Shakespeare,"Prithee, be silent, boy, I profit not by thy talk:"
Shakespeare,thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.
Shakespeare,"Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?"
Shakespeare,"Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases"
Shakespeare,"of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs,"
Shakespeare,"loads o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, cold"
Shakespeare,"palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing"
Shakespeare,"lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,"
Shakespeare,"limekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the"
Shakespeare,"rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take"
Shakespeare,again such preposterous discoveries!
Shakespeare,"Why thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest"
Shakespeare,thou to curse thus?
Shakespeare,Do I curse thee?
Shakespeare,"Why no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson"
Shakespeare,"indistinguishable cur, no."
Shakespeare,"No! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle"
Shakespeare,"immaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenet"
Shakespeare,"flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's"
Shakespeare,"purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered"
Shakespeare,"with such waterflies, diminutives of nature!"
Shakespeare,"Out, gall!"
Shakespeare,Finch-egg!
Shakespeare,"My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite"
Shakespeare,From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.
Shakespeare,"Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,"
Shakespeare,"A token from her daughter, my fair love,"
Shakespeare,Both taxing me and gaging me to keep
Shakespeare,An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:
Shakespeare,"Fall Greeks, fail fame, honour or go or stay,"
Shakespeare,"My major vow lies here, this I'll obey."
Shakespeare,"Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent:"
Shakespeare,This night in banqueting must all be spent.
Shakespeare,"Away, Patroclus!"
Shakespeare,"With too much blood and too little brain, these two"
Shakespeare,"may run mad, but, if with too much brain and too"
Shakespeare,"little blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen."
Shakespeare,"Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one"
Shakespeare,"that loves quails, but he has not so much brain as"
Shakespeare,earwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter
Shakespeare,"there, his brother, the bull,--the primitive statue,"
Shakespeare,"and oblique memorial of cuckolds, a thrifty"
Shakespeare,"shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's"
Shakespeare,"leg,--to what form but that he is, should wit larded"
Shakespeare,with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?
Shakespeare,"To an ass, were nothing, he is both ass and ox: to"
Shakespeare,"an ox, were nothing, he is both ox and ass. To be a"
Shakespeare,"dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an"
Shakespeare,"owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would"
Shakespeare,"not care, but to be Menelaus, I would conspire"
Shakespeare,"against destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I"
Shakespeare,"were not Thersites, for I care not to be the louse"
Shakespeare,"of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!"
Shakespeare,spirits and fires!
Shakespeare,"Enter HECTOR, TROILUS, AJAX, AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, MENELAUS, and DIOMEDES, with lights"
Shakespeare,"We go wrong, we go wrong."
Shakespeare,"No, yonder 'tis,"
Shakespeare,"There, where we see the lights."
Shakespeare,I trouble you.
Shakespeare,"No, not a whit."
Shakespeare,Here comes himself to guide you.
Shakespeare,Re-enter ACHILLES
Shakespeare,"Welcome, brave Hector, welcome, princes all."
Shakespeare,"So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night."
Shakespeare,Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.
Shakespeare,Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.
Shakespeare,"Good night, sweet lord Menelaus."
Shakespeare,"Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,"
Shakespeare,sweet sewer.
Shakespeare,"Good night and welcome, both at once, to those"
Shakespeare,That go or tarry.
Shakespeare,Exeunt AGAMEMNON and MENELAUS
Shakespeare,"Old Nestor tarries, and you too, Diomed,"
Shakespeare,Keep Hector company an hour or two.
Shakespeare,"I cannot, lord, I have important business,"
Shakespeare,"The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector."
Shakespeare,Give me your hand.
Shakespeare,"[Aside to TROILUS]  Follow his torch, he goes to"
Shakespeare,Calchas' tent:
Shakespeare,"Sweet sir, you honour me."
Shakespeare,"And so, good night."
Shakespeare,"And so, good night."
Shakespeare,"Exit DIOMEDES, ULYSSES and TROILUS following"
Shakespeare,"Come, come, enter my tent."
Shakespeare,"Exeunt ACHILLES, HECTOR, AJAX, and NESTOR"
Shakespeare,"That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most"
Shakespeare,"unjust knave, I will no more trust him when he leers"
Shakespeare,than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend
Shakespeare,"his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:"
Shakespeare,"but when he performs, astronomers foretell it, it"
Shakespeare,"is prodigious, there will come some change, the sun"
Shakespeare,"borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his"
Shakespeare,"word. I will rather leave to see Hector, than"
Shakespeare,not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan
Shakespeare,"drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll"
Shakespeare,after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!
Shakespeare,SCENE II. The same. Before Calchas' tent.
Shakespeare,"What, are you up here, ho? speak."
Shakespeare,[Within]  Who calls?
Shakespeare,"Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?"
Shakespeare,[Within]  She comes to you.
Shakespeare,"Enter TROILUS and ULYSSES, at a distance, after them, THERSITES"
Shakespeare,Stand where the torch may not discover us.
Shakespeare,Enter CRESSIDA
Shakespeare,Cressid comes forth to him.
Shakespeare,"How now, my charge!"
Shakespeare,"Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you."
Shakespeare,"Yea, so familiar!"
Shakespeare,She will sing any man at first sight.
Shakespeare,"And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff,"
Shakespeare,she's noted.
Shakespeare,Will you remember?
Shakespeare,Remember! yes.
Shakespeare,"Nay, but do, then,"
Shakespeare,And let your mind be coupled with your words.
Shakespeare,What should she remember?
Shakespeare,List.
Shakespeare,"Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly."
Shakespeare,Roguery!
Shakespeare,"Nay, then,--"
Shakespeare,"I'll tell you what,--"
Shakespeare,"Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn."
Shakespeare,"In faith, I cannot: what would you have me do?"
Shakespeare,"A juggling trick,--to be secretly open."
Shakespeare,What did you swear you would bestow on me?
Shakespeare,"I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath,"
Shakespeare,"Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek."
Shakespeare,"Hold, patience!"
Shakespeare,"How now, Trojan!"
Shakespeare,"Diomed,--"
Shakespeare,"No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more."
Shakespeare,Thy better must.
Shakespeare,"Hark, one word in your ear."
Shakespeare,O plague and madness!
Shakespeare,"You are moved, prince, let us depart, I pray you,"
Shakespeare,Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
Shakespeare,"To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous,"
Shakespeare,"The time right deadly, I beseech you, go."
Shakespeare,"Behold, I pray you!"
Shakespeare,"Nay, good my lord, go off:"
Shakespeare,"You flow to great distraction, come, my lord."
Shakespeare,"I pray thee, stay."
Shakespeare,"You have not patience, come."
Shakespeare,"I pray you, stay, by hell and all hell's torments"
Shakespeare,I will not speak a word!
Shakespeare,"Nay, but you part in anger."
Shakespeare,Doth that grieve thee?
Shakespeare,O wither'd truth!
Shakespeare,"Why, how now, lord!"
Shakespeare,"By Jove,"
Shakespeare,I will be patient.
Shakespeare,"Guardian!--why, Greek!"
Shakespeare,"Foh, foh! adieu, you palter."
Shakespeare,"In faith, I do not: come hither once again."
Shakespeare,"You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?"
Shakespeare,You will break out.
Shakespeare,She strokes his cheek!
Shakespeare,"Nay, stay, by Jove, I will not speak a word:"
Shakespeare,There is between my will and all offences
Shakespeare,A guard of patience: stay a little while.
Shakespeare,"How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and"
Shakespeare,"potato-finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!"
Shakespeare,"But will you, then?"
Shakespeare,"In faith, I will, la, never trust me else."
Shakespeare,Give me some token for the surety of it.
Shakespeare,I'll fetch you one.
Shakespeare,You have sworn patience.
Shakespeare,"Fear me not, sweet lord,"
Shakespeare,"I will not be myself, nor have cognition"
Shakespeare,Of what I feel: I am all patience.
Shakespeare,"Now the pledge, now, now, now!"
Shakespeare,"Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve."
Shakespeare,O beauty! where is thy faith?
Shakespeare,"I will be patient, outwardly I will."
Shakespeare,"You look upon that sleeve, behold it well."
Shakespeare,He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.
Shakespeare,Whose was't?
Shakespeare,"It is no matter, now I have't again."
Shakespeare,I will not meet with you to-morrow night:
Shakespeare,"I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more."
Shakespeare,"Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!"
Shakespeare,I shall have it.
Shakespeare,"What, this?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, that."
Shakespeare,"O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!"
Shakespeare,Thy master now lies thinking in his bed
Shakespeare,"Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,"
Shakespeare,"And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,"
Shakespeare,"As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me,"
Shakespeare,He that takes that doth take my heart withal.
Shakespeare,"I had your heart before, this follows it."
Shakespeare,I did swear patience.
Shakespeare,"You shall not have it, Diomed, faith, you shall not,"
Shakespeare,I'll give you something else.
Shakespeare,I will have this: whose was it?
Shakespeare,It is no matter.
Shakespeare,"Come, tell me whose it was."
Shakespeare,'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.
Shakespeare,"But, now you have it, take it."
Shakespeare,"By all Diana's waiting-women yond,"
Shakespeare,"And by herself, I will not tell you whose."
Shakespeare,"To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,"
Shakespeare,And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
Shakespeare,"Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,"
Shakespeare,It should be challenged.
Shakespeare,"Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not,"
Shakespeare,I will not keep my word.
Shakespeare,"Why, then, farewell,"
Shakespeare,Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.
Shakespeare,"You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,"
Shakespeare,But it straight starts you.
Shakespeare,I do not like this fooling.
Shakespeare,"Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best."
Shakespeare,"What, shall I come? the hour?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, come:--O Jove!--do come:--I shall be plagued."
Shakespeare,Farewell till then.
Shakespeare,"Good night: I prithee, come."
Shakespeare,Exit DIOMEDES
Shakespeare,"Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee"
Shakespeare,But with my heart the other eye doth see.
Shakespeare,"Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,"
Shakespeare,The error of our eye directs our mind:
Shakespeare,"What error leads must err, O, then conclude"
Shakespeare,Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.
Shakespeare,"A proof of strength she could not publish more,"
Shakespeare,Unless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.'
Shakespeare,"All's done, my lord."
Shakespeare,"Why stay we, then?"
Shakespeare,To make a recordation to my soul
Shakespeare,Of every syllable that here was spoke.
Shakespeare,"But if I tell how these two did co-act,"
Shakespeare,Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
Shakespeare,"Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,"
Shakespeare,"An esperance so obstinately strong,"
Shakespeare,"That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,"
Shakespeare,"As if those organs had deceptious functions,"
Shakespeare,Created only to calumniate.
Shakespeare,Was Cressid here?
Shakespeare,"I cannot conjure, Trojan."
Shakespeare,"She was not, sure."
Shakespeare,Most sure she was.
Shakespeare,"Why, my negation hath no taste of madness."
Shakespeare,"Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now."
Shakespeare,Let it not be believed for womanhood!
Shakespeare,"Think, we had mothers, do not give advantage"
Shakespeare,"To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,"
Shakespeare,"For depravation, to square the general sex"
Shakespeare,By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.
Shakespeare,"What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?"
Shakespeare,"Nothing at all, unless that this were she."
Shakespeare,Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?
Shakespeare,"This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:"
Shakespeare,"If beauty have a soul, this is not she,"
Shakespeare,"If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,"
Shakespeare,"If sanctimony be the gods' delight,"
Shakespeare,"If there be rule in unity itself,"
Shakespeare,"This is not she. O madness of discourse,"
Shakespeare,That cause sets up with and against itself!
Shakespeare,Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt
Shakespeare,"Without perdition, and loss assume all reason"
Shakespeare,"Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid."
Shakespeare,Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
Shakespeare,Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
Shakespeare,"Divides more wider than the sky and earth,"
Shakespeare,And yet the spacious breadth of this division
Shakespeare,Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
Shakespeare,As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.
Shakespeare,"Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates,"
Shakespeare,"Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:"
Shakespeare,"Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself,"
Shakespeare,"The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed,"
Shakespeare,"And with another knot, five-finger-tied,"
Shakespeare,"The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,"
Shakespeare,"The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics"
Shakespeare,"Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed."
Shakespeare,May worthy Troilus be half attach'd
Shakespeare,With that which here his passion doth express?
Shakespeare,"Ay, Greek, and that shall be divulged well"
Shakespeare,In characters as red as Mars his heart
Shakespeare,Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy
Shakespeare,With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.
Shakespeare,"Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,"
Shakespeare,So much by weight hate I her Diomed:
Shakespeare,"That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm,"
Shakespeare,"Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,"
Shakespeare,My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout
Shakespeare,"Which shipmen do the hurricano call,"
Shakespeare,"Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,"
Shakespeare,Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear
Shakespeare,In his descent than shall my prompted sword
Shakespeare,Falling on Diomed.
Shakespeare,He'll tickle it for his concupy.
Shakespeare,"O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!"
Shakespeare,"Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,"
Shakespeare,And they'll seem glorious.
Shakespeare,"O, contain yourself"
Shakespeare,Your passion draws ears hither.
Shakespeare,"I have been seeking you this hour, my lord:"
Shakespeare,"Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy,"
Shakespeare,"Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home."
Shakespeare,"Have with you, prince. My courteous lord, adieu."
Shakespeare,"Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,"
Shakespeare,"Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!"
Shakespeare,I'll bring you to the gates.
Shakespeare,Accept distracted thanks.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt TROILUS, AENEAS, and ULYSSES"
Shakespeare,Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
Shakespeare,"croak like a raven, I would bode, I would bode."
Shakespeare,Patroclus will give me any thing for the
Shakespeare,intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not
Shakespeare,do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.
Shakespeare,"Lechery, lechery, still, wars and lechery, nothing"
Shakespeare,else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!
Shakespeare,SCENE III. Troy. Before Priam's palace.
Shakespeare,Enter HECTOR and ANDROMACHE
Shakespeare,"When was my lord so much ungently temper'd,"
Shakespeare,To stop his ears against admonishment?
Shakespeare,"Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day."
Shakespeare,"You train me to offend you, get you in:"
Shakespeare,"By all the everlasting gods, I'll go!"
Shakespeare,"My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day."
Shakespeare,"No more, I say."
Shakespeare,Enter CASSANDRA
Shakespeare,Where is my brother Hector?
Shakespeare,"Here, sister, arm'd, and bloody in intent."
Shakespeare,"Consort with me in loud and dear petition,"
Shakespeare,"Pursue we him on knees, for I have dream'd"
Shakespeare,"Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night"
Shakespeare,Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.
Shakespeare,"O, 'tis true."
Shakespeare,Ho! bid my trumpet sound!
Shakespeare,"No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother."
Shakespeare,"Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear."
Shakespeare,The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:
Shakespeare,"They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd"
Shakespeare,Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.
Shakespeare,"O, be persuaded! do not count it holy"
Shakespeare,"To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,"
Shakespeare,"For we would give much, to use violent thefts,"
Shakespeare,And rob in the behalf of charity.
Shakespeare,"It is the purpose that makes strong the vow,"
Shakespeare,But vows to every purpose must not hold:
Shakespeare,"Unarm, sweet Hector."
Shakespeare,"Hold you still, I say,"
Shakespeare,Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate:
Shakespeare,"Lie every man holds dear, but the brave man"
Shakespeare,Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.
Shakespeare,"How now, young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?"
Shakespeare,"Cassandra, call my father to persuade."
Shakespeare,Exit CASSANDRA
Shakespeare,"No, faith, young Troilus, doff thy harness, youth,"
Shakespeare,I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:
Shakespeare,"Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,"
Shakespeare,And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
Shakespeare,"Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,"
Shakespeare,I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.
Shakespeare,"Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,"
Shakespeare,Which better fits a lion than a man.
Shakespeare,"What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it."
Shakespeare,"When many times the captive Grecian falls,"
Shakespeare,"Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,"
Shakespeare,"You bid them rise, and live."
Shakespeare,"O,'tis fair play."
Shakespeare,"Fool's play, by heaven, Hector."
Shakespeare,How now! how now!
Shakespeare,"For the love of all the gods,"
Shakespeare,"Let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers,"
Shakespeare,"And when we have our armours buckled on,"
Shakespeare,"The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords,"
Shakespeare,"Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth."
Shakespeare,"Fie, savage, fie!"
Shakespeare,"Hector, then 'tis wars."
Shakespeare,"Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day."
Shakespeare,Who should withhold me?
Shakespeare,"Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars"
Shakespeare,"Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire,"
Shakespeare,"Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,"
Shakespeare,"Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears,"
Shakespeare,"Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,"
Shakespeare,"Opposed to  hinder me, should stop my way,"
Shakespeare,But by my ruin.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter CASSANDRA, with PRIAM"
Shakespeare,"Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:"
Shakespeare,"He is thy crutch, now if thou lose thy stay,"
Shakespeare,"Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,"
Shakespeare,Fall all together.
Shakespeare,"Come, Hector, come, go back:"
Shakespeare,"Thy wife hath dream'd, thy mother hath had visions,"
Shakespeare,"Cassandra doth foresee, and I myself"
Shakespeare,Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
Shakespeare,To tell thee that this day is ominous:
Shakespeare,"Therefore, come back."
Shakespeare,"AEneas is a-field,"
Shakespeare,"And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,"
Shakespeare,"Even in the faith of valour, to appear"
Shakespeare,This morning to them.
Shakespeare,"Ay, but thou shalt not go."
Shakespeare,I must not break my faith.
Shakespeare,"You know me dutiful, therefore, dear sir,"
Shakespeare,"Let me not shame respect, but give me leave"
Shakespeare,"To take that course by your consent and voice,"
Shakespeare,"Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam."
Shakespeare,"O Priam, yield not to him!"
Shakespeare,"Do not, dear father."
Shakespeare,"Andromache, I am offended with you:"
Shakespeare,"Upon the love you bear me, get you in."
Shakespeare,Exit ANDROMACHE
Shakespeare,"This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl"
Shakespeare,Makes all these bodements.
Shakespeare,"O, farewell, dear Hector!"
Shakespeare,"Look, how thou diest! look, how thy eye turns pale!"
Shakespeare,"Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!"
Shakespeare,"Hark, how Troy roars! how Hecuba cries out!"
Shakespeare,How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!
Shakespeare,"Behold, distraction, frenzy and amazement,"
Shakespeare,"Like witless antics, one another meet,"
Shakespeare,"And all cry, Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!"
Shakespeare,Away! away!
Shakespeare,"Farewell: yet, soft! Hector! take my leave:"
Shakespeare,Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.
Shakespeare,"You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim:"
Shakespeare,"Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,"
Shakespeare,Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night.
Shakespeare,Farewell: the gods with safety stand about thee!
Shakespeare,Exeunt severally PRIAM and HECTOR. Alarums
Shakespeare,"They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,"
Shakespeare,"I come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve."
Shakespeare,"Do you hear, my lord? do you hear?"
Shakespeare,What now?
Shakespeare,Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.
Shakespeare,Let me read.
Shakespeare,"A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so"
Shakespeare,"troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl,"
Shakespeare,"and what one thing, what another, that I shall"
Shakespeare,leave you one o' these days: and I have a rheum
Shakespeare,"in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones"
Shakespeare,"that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell what"
Shakespeare,to think on't. What says she there?
Shakespeare,"Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart:"
Shakespeare,The effect doth operate another way.
Shakespeare,Tearing the letter
Shakespeare,"Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together."
Shakespeare,"My love with words and errors still she feeds,"
Shakespeare,But edifies another with her deeds.
Shakespeare,SCENE IV. Plains between Troy and the Grecian camp.
Shakespeare,Alarums: excursions. Enter THERSITES
Shakespeare,"Now they are clapper-clawing one another, I'll go"
Shakespeare,"look on. That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,"
Shakespeare,has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's
Shakespeare,sleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see
Shakespeare,"them meet, that that same young Trojan ass, that"
Shakespeare,"loves the whore there, might send that Greekish"
Shakespeare,"whore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the"
Shakespeare,"dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand."
Shakespeare,"O' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty"
Shakespeare,"swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry"
Shakespeare,"cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is"
Shakespeare,"not proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in"
Shakespeare,"policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of"
Shakespeare,"as bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax"
Shakespeare,"prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm"
Shakespeare,"to-day, whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim"
Shakespeare,"barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion."
Shakespeare,"Soft! here comes sleeve, and t'other."
Shakespeare,"Enter DIOMEDES, TROILUS following"
Shakespeare,"Fly not, for shouldst thou take the river Styx,"
Shakespeare,I would swim after.
Shakespeare,Thou dost miscall retire:
Shakespeare,"I do not fly, but advantageous care"
Shakespeare,Withdrew me from the odds of multitude:
Shakespeare,Have at thee!
Shakespeare,"Hold thy whore, Grecian!--now for thy whore,"
Shakespeare,"Trojan!--now the sleeve, now the sleeve!"
Shakespeare,"Exeunt TROILUS and DIOMEDES, fighting"
Shakespeare,Enter HECTOR
Shakespeare,Enter HECTOR
Shakespeare,Enter HECTOR
Shakespeare,"What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?"
Shakespeare,Art thou of blood and honour?
Shakespeare,"No, no, I am a rascal, a scurvy railing knave:"
Shakespeare,a very filthy rogue.
Shakespeare,I do believe thee: live.
Shakespeare,"God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me, but a"
Shakespeare,plague break thy neck for frightening me! What's
Shakespeare,become of the wenching rogues? I think they have
Shakespeare,swallowed one another: I would laugh at that
Shakespeare,"miracle: yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself."
Shakespeare,I'll seek them.
Shakespeare,SCENE V. Another part of the plains.
Shakespeare,Enter DIOMEDES and a Servant
Shakespeare,"Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse,"
Shakespeare,Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid:

Shakespeare,And am her knight by proof.
Shakespeare,Enter AGAMEMNON
Shakespeare,"Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamas"
Shakespeare,Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon
Shakespeare,"Hath Doreus prisoner,"
Shakespeare,"And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,"
Shakespeare,Upon the pashed corses of the kings
Shakespeare,"Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain,"
Shakespeare,"Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,"
Shakespeare,"Patroclus ta'en or slain, and Palamedes"
Shakespeare,Sore hurt and bruised: the dreadful Sagittary
Shakespeare,"Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,"
Shakespeare,"To reinforcement, or we perish all."
Shakespeare,Enter NESTOR
Shakespeare,"Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles,"
Shakespeare,And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame.
Shakespeare,There is a thousand Hectors in the field:
Shakespeare,"Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,"
Shakespeare,"And there lacks work, anon he's there afoot,"
Shakespeare,"And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls"
Shakespeare,"Before the belching whale, then is he yonder,"
Shakespeare,"And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,"
Shakespeare,"Fall down before him, like the mower's swath:"
Shakespeare,"Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes,"
Shakespeare,Dexterity so obeying appetite
Shakespeare,"That what he will he does, and does so much"
Shakespeare,That proof is call'd impossibility.
Shakespeare,Enter ULYSSES
Shakespeare,"O, courage, courage, princes! great Achilles"
Shakespeare,"Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance:"
Shakespeare,"Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood,"
Shakespeare,"Together with his mangled Myrmidons,"
Shakespeare,"That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him,"
Shakespeare,Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend
Shakespeare,"And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,"
Shakespeare,"Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day"
Shakespeare,"Mad and fantastic execution,"
Shakespeare,Engaging and redeeming of himself
Shakespeare,With such a careless force and forceless care
Shakespeare,"As if that luck, in very spite of cunning,"
Shakespeare,Bade him win all.
Shakespeare,Enter AJAX
Shakespeare,Enter AJAX
Shakespeare,Troilus! thou coward Troilus!
Shakespeare,"Ay, there, there."
Shakespeare,"So, so, we draw together."
Shakespeare,Where is this Hector?
Shakespeare,"Come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face,"
Shakespeare,Know what it is to meet Achilles angry:
Shakespeare,Hector? where's Hector? I will none but Hector.
Shakespeare,SCENE VI. Another part of the plains.
Shakespeare,"Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head!"
Shakespeare,"Troilus, I say! where's Troilus?"
Shakespeare,What wouldst thou?
Shakespeare,I would correct him.
Shakespeare,"Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office"
Shakespeare,"Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!"
Shakespeare,"O traitor Diomed! turn thy false face, thou traitor,"
Shakespeare,And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse!
Shakespeare,"Ha, art thou there?"
Shakespeare,"I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed."
Shakespeare,"He is my prize, I will not look upon."
Shakespeare,"Come, both you cogging Greeks, have at you both!"
Shakespeare,"Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!"
Shakespeare,"Now do I see thee, ha! have at thee, Hector!"
Shakespeare,"Pause, if thou wilt."
Shakespeare,"I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan:"
Shakespeare,Be happy that my arms are out of use:
Shakespeare,"My rest and negligence befriends thee now,"
Shakespeare,"But thou anon shalt hear of me again,"
Shakespeare,"Till when, go seek thy fortune."
Shakespeare,Fare thee well:
Shakespeare,"I would have been much more a fresher man,"
Shakespeare,"Had I expected thee. How now, my brother!"
Shakespeare,Ajax hath ta'en AEneas: shall it be?
Shakespeare,"No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,"
Shakespeare,"He shall not carry him: I'll be ta'en too,"
Shakespeare,"Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say!"
Shakespeare,I reck not though I end my life to-day.
Shakespeare,Enter one in sumptuous armour
Shakespeare,"Stand, stand, thou Greek, thou art a goodly mark:"
Shakespeare,"No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well,"
Shakespeare,"I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all,"
Shakespeare,"But I'll be master of it: wilt thou not,"
Shakespeare,"beast, abide?"
Shakespeare,"Why, then fly on, I'll hunt thee for thy hide."
Shakespeare,SCENE VII. Another part of the plains.
Shakespeare,"Enter ACHILLES, with Myrmidons"
Shakespeare,"Come here about me, you my Myrmidons,"
Shakespeare,Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:
Shakespeare,"Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath:"
Shakespeare,"And when I have the bloody Hector found,"
Shakespeare,"Empale him with your weapons round about,"
Shakespeare,In fellest manner execute your aims.
Shakespeare,"Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye:"
Shakespeare,It is decreed Hector the great must die.
Shakespeare,"Enter MENELAUS and PARIS, fighting: then THERSITES"
Shakespeare,"The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now,"
Shakespeare,"bull! now, dog! 'Loo, Paris, 'loo! now my double-"
Shakespeare,"henned sparrow! 'loo, Paris, 'loo! The bull has the"
Shakespeare,"game: ware horns, ho!"
Shakespeare,Exeunt PARIS and MENELAUS
Shakespeare,Enter MARGARELON
Shakespeare,"Turn, slave, and fight."
Shakespeare,A bastard son of Priam's.
Shakespeare,"I am a bastard too, I love bastards: I am a bastard"
Shakespeare,"begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard"
Shakespeare,"in valour, in every thing illegitimate. One bear will"
Shakespeare,"not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard?"
Shakespeare,"Take heed, the quarrel's most ominous to us: if the"
Shakespeare,"son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgment:"
Shakespeare,"farewell, bastard."
Shakespeare,"The devil take thee, coward!"
Shakespeare,SCENE VIII. Another part of the plains.
Shakespeare,"Most putrefied core, so fair without,"
Shakespeare,Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.
Shakespeare,"Now is my day's work done, I'll take good breath:"
Shakespeare,"Rest, sword, thou hast thy fill of blood and death."
Shakespeare,Puts off his helmet and hangs his shield behind him
Shakespeare,Enter ACHILLES and Myrmidons
Shakespeare,"Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set,"
Shakespeare,How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:
Shakespeare,"Even with the vail and darking of the sun,"
Shakespeare,"To close the day up, Hector's life is done."
Shakespeare,"I am unarm'd, forego this vantage, Greek."
Shakespeare,"Strike, fellows, strike, this is the man I seek."
Shakespeare,HECTOR falls
Shakespeare,"So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down!"
Shakespeare,"Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone."
Shakespeare,"On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,"
Shakespeare,'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.'
Shakespeare,Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.
Shakespeare,"The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord."
Shakespeare,"The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth,"
Shakespeare,"And, stickler-like, the armies separates."
Shakespeare,"My half-supp'd sword, that frankly would have fed,"
Shakespeare,"Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed."
Shakespeare,Sheathes his sword
Shakespeare,"Come, tie his body to my horse's tail,"
Shakespeare,Along the field I will the Trojan trail.
Shakespeare,SCENE IX. Another part of the plains.
Shakespeare,"Enter AGAMEMNON, AJAX, MENELAUS, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and others, marching. Shouts within"
Shakespeare,Hark! hark! what shout is that?
Shakespeare,"Peace, drums!"
Shakespeare,Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles.
Shakespeare,"The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles."
Shakespeare,"If it be so, yet bragless let it be,"
Shakespeare,Great Hector was a man as good as he.
Shakespeare,March patiently along: let one be sent
Shakespeare,To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
Shakespeare,"If in his death the gods have us befriended,"
Shakespeare,"Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended."
Shakespeare,SCENE X. Another part of the plains.
Shakespeare,Enter AENEAS and Trojans
Shakespeare,"Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:"
Shakespeare,"Never go home, here starve we out the night."
Shakespeare,Hector is slain.
Shakespeare,Hector! the gods forbid!
Shakespeare,"He's dead, and at the murderer's horse's tail,"
Shakespeare,"In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field."
Shakespeare,"Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!"
Shakespeare,"Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!"
Shakespeare,"I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,"
Shakespeare,And linger not our sure destructions on!
Shakespeare,"My lord, you do discomfort all the host!"
Shakespeare,You understand me not that tell me so:
Shakespeare,"I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,"
Shakespeare,But dare all imminence that gods and men
Shakespeare,Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:
Shakespeare,"Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?"
Shakespeare,"Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,"
Shakespeare,"Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:"
Shakespeare,"There is a word will Priam turn to stone,"
Shakespeare,"Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,"
Shakespeare,"Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,"
Shakespeare,"Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:"
Shakespeare,"Hector is dead, there is no more to say."
Shakespeare,"Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,"
Shakespeare,"Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,"
Shakespeare,"Let Titan rise as early as he dare,"
Shakespeare,"I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,"
Shakespeare,No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:
Shakespeare,"I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,"
Shakespeare,That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.
Shakespeare,Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:
Shakespeare,Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.
Shakespeare,Exeunt AENEAS and Trojans
Shakespeare,"As TROILUS is going out, enter, from the other side, PANDARUS"
Shakespeare,"But hear you, hear you!"
Shakespeare,"Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame"
Shakespeare,"Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!"
Shakespeare,A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world!
Shakespeare,world! world! thus is the poor agent despised!
Shakespeare,"O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set"
Shakespeare,"a-work, and how ill requited! why should our"
Shakespeare,endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?
Shakespeare,what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:
Shakespeare,"Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,"
Shakespeare,"Till he hath lost his honey and his sting,"
Shakespeare,"And being once subdued in armed tail,"
Shakespeare,Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.
Shakespeare,"Good traders in the flesh, set this in your"
Shakespeare,painted cloths.
Shakespeare,"As many as be here of pander's hall,"
Shakespeare,"Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall,"
Shakespeare,"Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,"
Shakespeare,"Though not for me, yet for your aching bones."
Shakespeare,"Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,"
Shakespeare,Some two months hence my will shall here be made:
Shakespeare,"It should be now, but that my fear is this,"
Shakespeare,Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:
Shakespeare,"Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,"
Shakespeare,And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. DUKE ORSINO's palace.
Shakespeare,"Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and other Lords, Musicians attending"
Shakespeare,"If music be the food of love, play on,"
Shakespeare,"Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,"
Shakespeare,"The appetite may sicken, and so die."
Shakespeare,That strain again! it had a dying fall:
Shakespeare,"O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,"
Shakespeare,"That breathes upon a bank of violets,"
Shakespeare,"Stealing and giving odour! Enough, no more:"
Shakespeare,'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
Shakespeare,"O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,"
Shakespeare,"That, notwithstanding thy capacity"
Shakespeare,"Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,"
Shakespeare,"Of what validity and pitch soe'er,"
Shakespeare,"But falls into abatement and low price,"
Shakespeare,Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy
Shakespeare,That it alone is high fantastical.
Shakespeare,"Will you go hunt, my lord?"
Shakespeare,"What, Curio?"
Shakespeare,The hart.
Shakespeare,"Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:"
Shakespeare,"O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,"
Shakespeare,Methought she purged the air of pestilence!
Shakespeare,"That instant was I turn'd into a hart,"
Shakespeare,"And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,"
Shakespeare,E'er since pursue me.
Shakespeare,Enter VALENTINE
Shakespeare,Enter VALENTINE
Shakespeare,Enter VALENTINE
Shakespeare,How now! what news from her?
Shakespeare,"So please my lord, I might not be admitted,"
Shakespeare,But from her handmaid do return this answer:
Shakespeare,"The element itself, till seven years' heat,"
Shakespeare,"Shall not behold her face at ample view,"
Shakespeare,"But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk"
Shakespeare,And water once a day her chamber round
Shakespeare,With eye-offending brine: all this to season
Shakespeare,"A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh"
Shakespeare,And lasting in her sad remembrance.
Shakespeare,"O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame"
Shakespeare,"To pay this debt of love but to a brother,"
Shakespeare,"How will she love, when the rich golden shaft"
Shakespeare,Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
Shakespeare,"That live in her, when liver, brain and heart,"
Shakespeare,"These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd"
Shakespeare,Her sweet perfections with one self king!
Shakespeare,Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
Shakespeare,Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. The sea-coast.
Shakespeare,"Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors"
Shakespeare,"What country, friends, is this?"
Shakespeare,"This is Illyria, lady."
Shakespeare,And what should I do in Illyria?
Shakespeare,My brother he is in Elysium.
Shakespeare,"Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?"
Shakespeare,It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
Shakespeare,O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
Shakespeare,"True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,"
Shakespeare,"Assure yourself, after our ship did split,"
Shakespeare,When you and those poor number saved with you
Shakespeare,"Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,"
Shakespeare,"Most provident in peril, bind himself,"
Shakespeare,"Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,"
Shakespeare,"To a strong mast that lived upon the sea,"
Shakespeare,"Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,"
Shakespeare,I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
Shakespeare,So long as I could see.
Shakespeare,"For saying so, there's gold:"
Shakespeare,"Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,"
Shakespeare,"Whereto thy speech serves for authority,"
Shakespeare,The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
Shakespeare,"Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born"
Shakespeare,Not three hours' travel from this very place.
Shakespeare,Who governs here?
Shakespeare,"A noble duke, in nature as in name."
Shakespeare,What is the name?
Shakespeare,Orsino.
Shakespeare,Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
Shakespeare,He was a bachelor then.
Shakespeare,"And so is now, or was so very late,"
Shakespeare,"For but a month ago I went from hence,"
Shakespeare,"And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,"
Shakespeare,"What great ones do the less will prattle of,--"
Shakespeare,That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
Shakespeare,What's she?
Shakespeare,"A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count"
Shakespeare,"That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her"
Shakespeare,"In the protection of his son, her brother,"
Shakespeare,"Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,"
Shakespeare,"They say, she hath abjured the company"
Shakespeare,And sight of men.
Shakespeare,O that I served that lady
Shakespeare,"And might not be delivered to the world,"
Shakespeare,"Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,"
Shakespeare,What my estate is!
Shakespeare,"That were hard to compass,"
Shakespeare,"Because she will admit no kind of suit,"
Shakespeare,"No, not the duke's."
Shakespeare,"There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,"
Shakespeare,And though that nature with a beauteous wall
Shakespeare,"Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee"
Shakespeare,I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
Shakespeare,With this thy fair and outward character.
Shakespeare,"I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,"
Shakespeare,"Conceal me what I am, and be my aid"
Shakespeare,For such disguise as haply shall become
Shakespeare,The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
Shakespeare,Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
Shakespeare,"It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing"
Shakespeare,And speak to him in many sorts of music
Shakespeare,That will allow me very worth his service.
Shakespeare,"What else may hap to time I will commit,"
Shakespeare,Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
Shakespeare,"Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:"
Shakespeare,"When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see."
Shakespeare,I thank thee: lead me on.
Shakespeare,SCENE III. OLIVIA'S house.
Shakespeare,Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA
Shakespeare,Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA
Shakespeare,"What a plague means my niece, to take the death of"
Shakespeare,her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
Shakespeare,"By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'"
Shakespeare,"nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great"
Shakespeare,exceptions to your ill hours.
Shakespeare,"Why, let her except, before excepted."
Shakespeare,"Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest"
Shakespeare,limits of order.
Shakespeare,Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:
Shakespeare,"these clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be"
Shakespeare,"these boots too: an they be not, let them hang"
Shakespeare,themselves in their own straps.
Shakespeare,That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard
Shakespeare,"my lady talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish"
Shakespeare,knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
Shakespeare,"Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, he."
Shakespeare,He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
Shakespeare,What's that to the purpose?
Shakespeare,"Why, he has three thousand ducats a year."
Shakespeare,"Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:"
Shakespeare,he's a very fool and a prodigal.
Shakespeare,"Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the"
Shakespeare,"viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages"
Shakespeare,"word for word without book, and hath all the good"
Shakespeare,gifts of nature.
Shakespeare,"He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that"
Shakespeare,"he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that"
Shakespeare,he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
Shakespeare,"hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent"
Shakespeare,he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
Shakespeare,"By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors"
Shakespeare,that say so of him. Who are they?
Shakespeare,"They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company."
Shakespeare,With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to
Shakespeare,her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
Shakespeare,drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill
Shakespeare,that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
Shakespeare,"o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!"
Shakespeare,Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
Shakespeare,Enter SIR ANDREW
Shakespeare,Enter SIR ANDREW
Shakespeare,Enter SIR ANDREW
Shakespeare,"Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!"
Shakespeare,Sweet Sir Andrew!
Shakespeare,"Bless you, fair shrew."
Shakespeare,"And you too, sir."
Shakespeare,"Accost, Sir Andrew, accost."
Shakespeare,My niece's chambermaid.
Shakespeare,"Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance."
Shakespeare,"My name is Mary, sir."
Shakespeare,"Good Mistress Mary Accost,--"
Shakespeare,"You mistake, knight, 'accost' is front her, board"
Shakespeare,"her, woo her, assail her."
Shakespeare,"By my troth, I would not undertake her in this"
Shakespeare,company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?
Shakespeare,"Fare you well, gentlemen."
Shakespeare,"An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst"
Shakespeare,never draw sword again.
Shakespeare,"An you part so, mistress, I would I might never"
Shakespeare,"draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have"
Shakespeare,fools in hand?
Shakespeare,"Sir, I have not you by the hand."
Shakespeare,"Marry, but you shall have, and here's my hand."
Shakespeare,"Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring"
Shakespeare,your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.
Shakespeare,"Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?"
Shakespeare,"It's dry, sir."
Shakespeare,"Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can"
Shakespeare,keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?
Shakespeare,"A dry jest, sir."
Shakespeare,Are you full of them?
Shakespeare,"Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,"
Shakespeare,"now I let go your hand, I am barren."
Shakespeare,O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I
Shakespeare,see thee so put down?
Shakespeare,"Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary"
Shakespeare,put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
Shakespeare,than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
Shakespeare,great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
Shakespeare,"An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home"
Shakespeare,"to-morrow, Sir Toby."
Shakespeare,"Pourquoi, my dear knight?"
Shakespeare,What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
Shakespeare,bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
Shakespeare,"fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but"
Shakespeare,followed the arts!
Shakespeare,Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
Shakespeare,"Why, would that have mended my hair?"
Shakespeare,"Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature."
Shakespeare,"But it becomes me well enough, does't not?"
Shakespeare,"Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff, and I"
Shakespeare,hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
Shakespeare,and spin it off.
Shakespeare,"Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece"
Shakespeare,"will not be seen, or if she be, it's four to one"
Shakespeare,she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.
Shakespeare,She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
Shakespeare,"her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit, I"
Shakespeare,"have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,"
Shakespeare,I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
Shakespeare,"strangest mind i' the world, I delight in masques"
Shakespeare,and revels sometimes altogether.
Shakespeare,"Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?"
Shakespeare,"As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the"
Shakespeare,"degree of my betters, and yet I will not compare"
Shakespeare,with an old man.
Shakespeare,"What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?"
Shakespeare,"Faith, I can cut a caper."
Shakespeare,And I can cut the mutton to't.
Shakespeare,And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
Shakespeare,as any man in Illyria.
Shakespeare,Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
Shakespeare,these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
Shakespeare,"take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost"
Shakespeare,thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
Shakespeare,"a coranto? My very walk should be a jig, I would not"
Shakespeare,so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
Shakespeare,dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
Shakespeare,"I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy"
Shakespeare,"leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard."
Shakespeare,"Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a"
Shakespeare,flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?
Shakespeare,What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
Shakespeare,Taurus! That's sides and heart.
Shakespeare,"No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see the"
Shakespeare,"caper, ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!"
Shakespeare,SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.
Shakespeare,SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.
Shakespeare,Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in man's attire
Shakespeare,"If the duke continue these favours towards you,"
Shakespeare,"Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath"
Shakespeare,"known you but three days, and already you are no stranger."
Shakespeare,"You either fear his humour or my negligence, that"
Shakespeare,you call in question the continuance of his love:
Shakespeare,"is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?"
Shakespeare,"No, believe me."
Shakespeare,"No, believe me."
Shakespeare,I thank you. Here comes the count.
Shakespeare,"Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and Attendants"
Shakespeare,"Who saw Cesario, ho?"
Shakespeare,"On your attendance, my lord, here."
Shakespeare,"Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,"
Shakespeare,"Thou know'st no less but all, I have unclasp'd"
Shakespeare,To thee the book even of my secret soul:
Shakespeare,"Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her,"
Shakespeare,"Be not denied access, stand at her doors,"
Shakespeare,"And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow"
Shakespeare,Till thou have audience.
Shakespeare,"Sure, my noble lord,"
Shakespeare,If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
Shakespeare,"As it is spoke, she never will admit me."
Shakespeare,Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
Shakespeare,Rather than make unprofited return.
Shakespeare,"Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?"
Shakespeare,"O, then unfold the passion of my love,"
Shakespeare,Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
Shakespeare,"It shall become thee well to act my woes,"
Shakespeare,She will attend it better in thy youth
Shakespeare,Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.
Shakespeare,"I think not so, my lord."
Shakespeare,"Dear lad, believe it,"
Shakespeare,"For they shall yet belie thy happy years,"
Shakespeare,That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
Shakespeare,"Is not more smooth and rubious, thy small pipe"
Shakespeare,"Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,"
Shakespeare,And all is semblative a woman's part.
Shakespeare,I know thy constellation is right apt
Shakespeare,"For this affair. Some four or five attend him,"
Shakespeare,"All, if you will, for I myself am best"
Shakespeare,"When least in company. Prosper well in this,"
Shakespeare,"And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,"
Shakespeare,To call his fortunes thine.
Shakespeare,I'll do my best
Shakespeare,To woo your lady:
Shakespeare,"yet, a barful strife!"
Shakespeare,"Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife."
Shakespeare,SCENE V. OLIVIA'S house.
Shakespeare,Enter MARIA and Clown
Shakespeare,Enter MARIA and Clown
Shakespeare,"Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will"
Shakespeare,not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
Shakespeare,way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.
Shakespeare,Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this
Shakespeare,world needs to fear no colours.
Shakespeare,Make that good.
Shakespeare,He shall see none to fear.
Shakespeare,A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that
Shakespeare,"saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'"
Shakespeare,"Where, good Mistress Mary?"
Shakespeare,"In the wars, and that may you be bold to say in your foolery."
Shakespeare,"Well, God give them wisdom that have it, and those"
Shakespeare,"that are fools, let them use their talents."
Shakespeare,"Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent, or,"
Shakespeare,"to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?"
Shakespeare,"Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage, and,"
Shakespeare,"for turning away, let summer bear it out."
Shakespeare,"You are resolute, then?"
Shakespeare,"Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points."
Shakespeare,"That if one break, the other will hold, or, if both"
Shakespeare,"break, your gaskins fall."
Shakespeare,"Apt, in good faith, very apt. Well, go thy way, if"
Shakespeare,"Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a"
Shakespeare,piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.
Shakespeare,"Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my"
Shakespeare,"lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best."
Shakespeare,"Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!"
Shakespeare,"Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft"
Shakespeare,"prove fools, and I, that am sure I lack thee, may"
Shakespeare,pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
Shakespeare,"'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'"
Shakespeare,Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO
Shakespeare,"God bless thee, lady!"
Shakespeare,Take the fool away.
Shakespeare,"Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady."
Shakespeare,"Go to, you're a dry fool, I'll no more of you:"
Shakespeare,"besides, you grow dishonest."
Shakespeare,"Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel"
Shakespeare,"will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is"
Shakespeare,the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
Shakespeare,"himself, if he mend, he is no longer dishonest, if"
Shakespeare,"he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing"
Shakespeare,that's mended is but patched: virtue that
Shakespeare,"transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that"
Shakespeare,amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
Shakespeare,"simple syllogism will serve, so, if it will not,"
Shakespeare,what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
Shakespeare,"calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take"
Shakespeare,"away the fool, therefore, I say again, take her away."
Shakespeare,"Sir, I bade them take away you."
Shakespeare,"Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non"
Shakespeare,"facit monachum, that's as much to say as I wear not"
Shakespeare,"motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to"
Shakespeare,prove you a fool.
Shakespeare,Can you do it?
Shakespeare,"Dexterously, good madonna."
Shakespeare,Make your proof.
Shakespeare,"I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse"
Shakespeare,"of virtue, answer me."
Shakespeare,"Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof."
Shakespeare,"Good madonna, why mournest thou?"
Shakespeare,"Good fool, for my brother's death."
Shakespeare,"I think his soul is in hell, madonna."
Shakespeare,"I know his soul is in heaven, fool."
Shakespeare,"The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's"
Shakespeare,"soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen."
Shakespeare,"What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?"
Shakespeare,"Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:"
Shakespeare,"infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the"
Shakespeare,better fool.
Shakespeare,"God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the"
Shakespeare,better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
Shakespeare,"sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his"
Shakespeare,word for two pence that you are no fool.
Shakespeare,"How say you to that, Malvolio?"
Shakespeare,I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
Shakespeare,barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
Shakespeare,with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
Shakespeare,"than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard"
Shakespeare,"already, unless you laugh and minister occasion to"
Shakespeare,"him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,"
Shakespeare,"that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better"
Shakespeare,than the fools' zanies.
Shakespeare,"Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste"
Shakespeare,"with a distempered appetite. To be generous,"
Shakespeare,"guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those"
Shakespeare,things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:
Shakespeare,"there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do"
Shakespeare,"nothing but rail, nor no railing in a known discreet"
Shakespeare,"man, though he do nothing but reprove."
Shakespeare,"Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou"
Shakespeare,speakest well of fools!
Shakespeare,Re-enter MARIA
Shakespeare,Re-enter MARIA
Shakespeare,Re-enter MARIA
Shakespeare,"Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much"
Shakespeare,desires to speak with you.
Shakespeare,"From the Count Orsino, is it?"
Shakespeare,"I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended."
Shakespeare,Who of my people hold him in delay?
Shakespeare,"Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman."
Shakespeare,"Fetch him off, I pray you, he speaks nothing but"
Shakespeare,madman: fie on him!
Shakespeare,Exit MARIA
Shakespeare,Exit MARIA
Shakespeare,"Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I"
Shakespeare,"am sick, or not at home, what you will, to dismiss it."
Shakespeare,Exit MALVOLIO
Shakespeare,"Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and"
Shakespeare,people dislike it.
Shakespeare,"Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest"
Shakespeare,"son should be a fool, whose skull Jove cram with"
Shakespeare,"brains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has a"
Shakespeare,most weak pia mater.
Shakespeare,Enter SIR TOBY BELCH
Shakespeare,"By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?"
Shakespeare,A gentleman! what gentleman?
Shakespeare,'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these
Shakespeare,"pickle-herring! How now, sot!"
Shakespeare,Good Sir Toby!
Shakespeare,"Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?"
Shakespeare,Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.
Shakespeare,"Ay, marry, what is he?"
Shakespeare,"Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give"
Shakespeare,"me faith, say I. Well, it's all one."
Shakespeare,"What's a drunken man like, fool?"
Shakespeare,"Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one"
Shakespeare,"draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads"
Shakespeare,"him, and a third drowns him."
Shakespeare,"Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my"
Shakespeare,"coz, for he's in the third degree of drink, he's"
Shakespeare,"drowned: go, look after him."
Shakespeare,"He is but mad yet, madonna, and the fool shall look"
Shakespeare,to the madman.
Shakespeare,Re-enter MALVOLIO
Shakespeare,Re-enter MALVOLIO
Shakespeare,"Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with"
Shakespeare,"you. I told him you were sick, he takes on him to"
Shakespeare,"understand so much, and therefore comes to speak"
Shakespeare,"with you. I told him you were asleep, he seems to"
Shakespeare,"have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore"
Shakespeare,"comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,"
Shakespeare,lady? he's fortified against any denial.
Shakespeare,Tell him he shall not speak with me.
Shakespeare,"Has been told so, and he says, he'll stand at your"
Shakespeare,"door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to"
Shakespeare,"a bench, but he'll speak with you."
Shakespeare,What kind o' man is he?
Shakespeare,"Why, of mankind."
Shakespeare,What manner of man?
Shakespeare,"Of very ill manner, he'll speak with you, will you or no."
Shakespeare,Of what personage and years is he?
Shakespeare,"Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for"
Shakespeare,"a boy, as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a"
Shakespeare,cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him
Shakespeare,"in standing water, between boy and man. He is very"
Shakespeare,"well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly, one"
Shakespeare,would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.
Shakespeare,Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.
Shakespeare,"Gentlewoman, my lady calls."
Shakespeare,"Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face."
Shakespeare,We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.
Shakespeare,"Enter VIOLA, and Attendants"
Shakespeare,"The honourable lady of the house, which is she?"
Shakespeare,"Speak to me, I shall answer for her."
Shakespeare,"Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I"
Shakespeare,"pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,"
Shakespeare,for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
Shakespeare,"my speech, for besides that it is excellently well"
Shakespeare,"penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good"
Shakespeare,"beauties, let me sustain no scorn, I am very"
Shakespeare,"comptible, even to the least sinister usage."
Shakespeare,"Whence came you, sir?"
Shakespeare,"I can say little more than I have studied, and that"
Shakespeare,"question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me"
Shakespeare,"modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,"
Shakespeare,that I may proceed in my speech.
Shakespeare,Are you a comedian?
Shakespeare,"No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs"
Shakespeare,"of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you"
Shakespeare,the lady of the house?
Shakespeare,"If I do not usurp myself, I am."
Shakespeare,"Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp"
Shakespeare,"yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours"
Shakespeare,to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will
Shakespeare,"on with my speech in your praise, and then show you"
Shakespeare,the heart of my message.
Shakespeare,Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.
Shakespeare,"Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical."
Shakespeare,"It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,"
Shakespeare,"keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,"
Shakespeare,and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
Shakespeare,"than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone, if"
Shakespeare,"you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of"
Shakespeare,moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
Shakespeare,"Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way."
Shakespeare,"No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little"
Shakespeare,"longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet"
Shakespeare,lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.
Shakespeare,"Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when"
Shakespeare,the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
Shakespeare,It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
Shakespeare,"war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my"
Shakespeare,"hand, my words are as fun of peace as matter."
Shakespeare,Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
Shakespeare,The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
Shakespeare,"learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I"
Shakespeare,"would, are as secret as maidenhead, to your ears,"
Shakespeare,"divinity, to any other's, profanation."
Shakespeare,Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.
Shakespeare,Exeunt MARIA and Attendants
Shakespeare,"Now, sir, what is your text?"
Shakespeare,"Most sweet lady,--"
Shakespeare,"A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it."
Shakespeare,Where lies your text?
Shakespeare,In Orsino's bosom.
Shakespeare,In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
Shakespeare,"To answer by the method, in the first of his heart."
Shakespeare,"O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?"
Shakespeare,"Good madam, let me see your face."
Shakespeare,Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
Shakespeare,with my face? You are now out of your text: but
Shakespeare,we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
Shakespeare,"Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't"
Shakespeare,not well done?
Shakespeare,"Excellently done, if God did all."
Shakespeare,"'Tis in grain, sir, 'twill endure wind and weather."
Shakespeare,"'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white"
Shakespeare,Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
Shakespeare,"Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,"
Shakespeare,If you will lead these graces to the grave
Shakespeare,And leave the world no copy.
Shakespeare,"O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted, I will give"
Shakespeare,out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
Shakespeare,"inventoried, and every particle and utensil"
Shakespeare,"labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,"
Shakespeare,"indifferent red, item, two grey eyes, with lids to"
Shakespeare,"them, item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were"
Shakespeare,you sent hither to praise me?
Shakespeare,"I see you what you are, you are too proud,"
Shakespeare,"But, if you were the devil, you are fair."
Shakespeare,"My lord and master loves you: O, such love"
Shakespeare,"Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd"
Shakespeare,The nonpareil of beauty!
Shakespeare,How does he love me?
Shakespeare,"With adorations, fertile tears,"
Shakespeare,"With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire."
Shakespeare,"Your lord does know my mind, I cannot love him:"
Shakespeare,"Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,"
Shakespeare,"Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth,"
Shakespeare,"In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant,"
Shakespeare,And in dimension and the shape of nature
Shakespeare,"A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him,"
Shakespeare,He might have took his answer long ago.
Shakespeare,"If I did love you in my master's flame,"
Shakespeare,"With such a suffering, such a deadly life,"
Shakespeare,"In your denial I would find no sense,"
Shakespeare,I would not understand it.
Shakespeare,"Why, what would you?"
Shakespeare,"Make me a willow cabin at your gate,"
Shakespeare,"And call upon my soul within the house,"
Shakespeare,Write loyal cantons of contemned love
Shakespeare,"And sing them loud even in the dead of night,"
Shakespeare,Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
Shakespeare,And make the babbling gossip of the air
Shakespeare,"Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest"
Shakespeare,"Between the elements of air and earth,"
Shakespeare,But you should pity me!
Shakespeare,You might do much.
Shakespeare,What is your parentage?
Shakespeare,"Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:"
Shakespeare,I am a gentleman.
Shakespeare,"Get you to your lord,"
Shakespeare,"I cannot love him: let him send no more,"
Shakespeare,"Unless, perchance, you come to me again,"
Shakespeare,To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
Shakespeare,I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
Shakespeare,"I am no fee'd post, lady, keep your purse:"
Shakespeare,"My master, not myself, lacks recompense."
Shakespeare,"Love make his heart of flint that you shall love,"
Shakespeare,"And let your fervor, like my master's, be"
Shakespeare,"Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty."
Shakespeare,'What is your parentage?'
Shakespeare,"'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:"
Shakespeare,"I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art,"
Shakespeare,"Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,"
Shakespeare,Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
Shakespeare,"soft, soft!"
Shakespeare,Unless the master were the man. How now!
Shakespeare,Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
Shakespeare,Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
Shakespeare,With an invisible and subtle stealth
Shakespeare,"To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be."
Shakespeare,"What ho, Malvolio!"
Shakespeare,"Here, madam, at your service."
Shakespeare,"Run after that same peevish messenger,"
Shakespeare,"The county's man: he left this ring behind him,"
Shakespeare,Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.
Shakespeare,"Desire him not to flatter with his lord,"
Shakespeare,"Nor hold him up with hopes, I am not for him:"
Shakespeare,"If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,"
Shakespeare,"I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio."
Shakespeare,"I do I know not what, and fear to find"
Shakespeare,Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
Shakespeare,"Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe,"
Shakespeare,"What is decreed must be, and be this so."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. The sea-coast.
Shakespeare,Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
Shakespeare,Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?
Shakespeare,"By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over"
Shakespeare,me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
Shakespeare,"distemper yours, therefore I shall crave of you your"
Shakespeare,leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
Shakespeare,"recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you."
Shakespeare,ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
Shakespeare,"No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere"
Shakespeare,extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
Shakespeare,"touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me"
Shakespeare,"what I am willing to keep in, therefore it charges"
Shakespeare,me in manners the rather to express myself. You
Shakespeare,"must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,"
Shakespeare,which I called Roderigo. My father was that
Shakespeare,"Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard"
Shakespeare,"of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both"
Shakespeare,"born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,"
Shakespeare,"would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that,"
Shakespeare,for some hour before you took me from the breach of
Shakespeare,the sea was my sister drowned.
Shakespeare,Alas the day!
Shakespeare,"A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled"
Shakespeare,"me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,"
Shakespeare,though I could not with such estimable wonder
Shakespeare,"overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly"
Shakespeare,"publish her, she bore a mind that envy could not but"
Shakespeare,"call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt"
Shakespeare,"water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more."
Shakespeare,"Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment."
Shakespeare,"O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble."
Shakespeare,"If you will not murder me for my love, let me be"
Shakespeare,"If you will not undo what you have done, that is,"
Shakespeare,"kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not."
Shakespeare,"Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,"
Shakespeare,"and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that"
Shakespeare,upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
Shakespeare,tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.
Shakespeare,The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
Shakespeare,"I have many enemies in Orsino's court,"
Shakespeare,Else would I very shortly see thee there.
Shakespeare,"But, come what may, I do adore thee so,"
Shakespeare,"That danger shall seem sport, and I will go."
Shakespeare,"Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following"
Shakespeare,Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
Shakespeare,"Even now, sir, on a moderate pace I have since"
Shakespeare,arrived but hither.
Shakespeare,"She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have"
Shakespeare,"saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself."
Shakespeare,"She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord"
Shakespeare,into a desperate assurance she will none of him:
Shakespeare,"and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to"
Shakespeare,"come again in his affairs, unless it be to report"
Shakespeare,your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.
Shakespeare,She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.
Shakespeare,"Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and her"
Shakespeare,"will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth"
Shakespeare,"stooping for, there it lies in your eye, if not, be"
Shakespeare,it his that finds it.
Shakespeare,I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
Shakespeare,Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
Shakespeare,"She made good view of me, indeed, so much,"
Shakespeare,"That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,"
Shakespeare,For she did speak in starts distractedly.
Shakespeare,"She loves me, sure, the cunning of her passion"
Shakespeare,Invites me in this churlish messenger.
Shakespeare,"None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none."
Shakespeare,"I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,"
Shakespeare,"Poor lady, she were better love a dream."
Shakespeare,"Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,"
Shakespeare,Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
Shakespeare,How easy is it for the proper-false
Shakespeare,In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
Shakespeare,"Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!"
Shakespeare,"For such as we are made of, such we be."
Shakespeare,"How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly,"
Shakespeare,"And I, poor monster, fond as much on him,"
Shakespeare,"And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me."
Shakespeare,"What will become of this? As I am man,"
Shakespeare,"My state is desperate for my master's love,"
Shakespeare,"As I am woman,--now alas the day!--"
Shakespeare,What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
Shakespeare,"O time! thou must untangle this, not I,"
Shakespeare,It is too hard a knot for me to untie!
Shakespeare,SCENE III. OLIVIA's house.
Shakespeare,Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW
Shakespeare,"Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed after"
Shakespeare,"midnight is to be up betimes, and 'diluculo"
Shakespeare,"surgere,' thou know'st,--"
Shakespeare,"Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know, to be up"
Shakespeare,late is to be up late.
Shakespeare,A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.
Shakespeare,"To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is"
Shakespeare,early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go
Shakespeare,to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the
Shakespeare,four elements?
Shakespeare,"Faith, so they say, but I think it rather consists"
Shakespeare,of eating and drinking.
Shakespeare,"Thou'rt a scholar, let us therefore eat and drink."
Shakespeare,"Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!"
Shakespeare,"Here comes the fool, i' faith."
Shakespeare,"How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture"
Shakespeare,of 'we three'?
Shakespeare,"Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch."
Shakespeare,"By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I"
Shakespeare,"had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,"
Shakespeare,"and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In"
Shakespeare,"sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last"
Shakespeare,"night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the"
Shakespeare,Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas
Shakespeare,"very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy"
Shakespeare,leman: hadst it?
Shakespeare,"I did impeticos thy gratillity, for Malvolio's nose"
Shakespeare,"is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the"
Shakespeare,Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.
Shakespeare,"Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all"
Shakespeare,"is done. Now, a song."
Shakespeare,"Come on, there is sixpence for you: let's have a song."
Shakespeare,There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--
Shakespeare,"Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?"
Shakespeare,"A love-song, a love-song."
Shakespeare,"Ay, ay: I care not for good life."
Shakespeare,"O mistress mine, where are you roaming?"
Shakespeare,"O, stay and hear, your true love's coming,"
Shakespeare,That can sing both high and low:
Shakespeare,"Trip no further, pretty sweeting,"
Shakespeare,"Journeys end in lovers meeting,"
Shakespeare,Every wise man's son doth know.
Shakespeare,"Excellent good, i' faith."
Shakespeare,"Good, good."
Shakespeare,"What is love? 'tis not hereafter,"
Shakespeare,"Present mirth hath present laughter,"
Shakespeare,What's to come is still unsure:
Shakespeare,"In delay there lies no plenty,"
Shakespeare,"Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,"
Shakespeare,Youth's a stuff will not endure.
Shakespeare,"A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight."
Shakespeare,A contagious breath.
Shakespeare,"Very sweet and contagious, i' faith."
Shakespeare,"To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion."
Shakespeare,But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? shall we
Shakespeare,rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three
Shakespeare,souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?
Shakespeare,"An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch."
Shakespeare,"By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well."
Shakespeare,"Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'"
Shakespeare,"'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall be"
Shakespeare,"constrained in't to call thee knave, knight."
Shakespeare,'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to
Shakespeare,"call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'"
Shakespeare,I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
Shakespeare,"Good, i' faith. Come, begin."
Shakespeare,Catch sung
Shakespeare,Enter MARIA
Shakespeare,Enter MARIA
Shakespeare,Enter MARIA
Shakespeare,What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady
Shakespeare,have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him
Shakespeare,"turn you out of doors, never trust me."
Shakespeare,"My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's"
Shakespeare,"a Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.' Am not"
Shakespeare,I consanguineous? am I not of her blood?
Shakespeare,Tillyvally. Lady!
Shakespeare,"'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'"
Shakespeare,"Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling."
Shakespeare,"Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do"
Shakespeare,"I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it"
Shakespeare,more natural.
Shakespeare,"[Sings]  'O, the twelfth day of December,'--"
Shakespeare,"For the love o' God, peace!"
Shakespeare,Enter MALVOLIO
Shakespeare,Enter MALVOLIO
Shakespeare,"My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have ye"
Shakespeare,"no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like"
Shakespeare,tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an
Shakespeare,"alehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your"
Shakespeare,coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse
Shakespeare,"of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor"
Shakespeare,time in you?
Shakespeare,"We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!"
Shakespeare,"Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me"
Shakespeare,"tell you, that, though she harbours you as her"
Shakespeare,"kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If"
Shakespeare,"you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you"
Shakespeare,"are welcome to the house, if not, an it would please"
Shakespeare,"you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid"
Shakespeare,you farewell.
Shakespeare,"'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'"
Shakespeare,"Nay, good Sir Toby."
Shakespeare,'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'
Shakespeare,Is't even so?
Shakespeare,'But I will never die.'
Shakespeare,"Sir Toby, there you lie."
Shakespeare,This is much credit to you.
Shakespeare,'Shall I bid him go?'
Shakespeare,'What an if you do?'
Shakespeare,"'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'"
Shakespeare,"'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'"
Shakespeare,"Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than a"
Shakespeare,"steward? Dost thou think, because thou art"
Shakespeare,"virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?"
Shakespeare,"Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the"
Shakespeare,mouth too.
Shakespeare,"Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with"
Shakespeare,"crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!"
Shakespeare,"Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at any"
Shakespeare,"thing more than contempt, you would not give means"
Shakespeare,"for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand."
Shakespeare,Go shake your ears.
Shakespeare,'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's
Shakespeare,"a-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then to"
Shakespeare,break promise with him and make a fool of him.
Shakespeare,"Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'll"
Shakespeare,deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
Shakespeare,"Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight: since the"
Shakespeare,"youth of the count's was today with thy lady, she is"
Shakespeare,"much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me"
Shakespeare,alone with him: if I do not gull him into a
Shakespeare,"nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not"
Shakespeare,think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:
Shakespeare,I know I can do it.
Shakespeare,"Possess us, possess us, tell us something of him."
Shakespeare,"Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan."
Shakespeare,"O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!"
Shakespeare,"What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,"
Shakespeare,dear knight?
Shakespeare,"I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason"
Shakespeare,good enough.
Shakespeare,"The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing"
Shakespeare,"constantly, but a time-pleaser, an affectioned ass,"
Shakespeare,that cons state without book and utters it by great
Shakespeare,"swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so"
Shakespeare,"crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is"
Shakespeare,his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
Shakespeare,"him, and on that vice in him will my revenge find"
Shakespeare,notable cause to work.
Shakespeare,What wilt thou do?
Shakespeare,I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of
Shakespeare,"love, wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape"
Shakespeare,"of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure"
Shakespeare,"of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find"
Shakespeare,himself most feelingly personated. I can write very
Shakespeare,like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we
Shakespeare,can hardly make distinction of our hands.
Shakespeare,Excellent! I smell a device.
Shakespeare,I have't in my nose too.
Shakespeare,"He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,"
Shakespeare,"that they come from my niece, and that she's in"
Shakespeare,love with him.
Shakespeare,"My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour."
Shakespeare,And your horse now would make him an ass.
Shakespeare,"Ass, I doubt not."
Shakespeare,"O, 'twill be admirable!"
Shakespeare,"Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic will"
Shakespeare,"work with him. I will plant you two, and let the"
Shakespeare,"fool make a third, where he shall find the letter:"
Shakespeare,"observe his construction of it. For this night, to"
Shakespeare,"bed, and dream on the event. Farewell."
Shakespeare,"Good night, Penthesilea."
Shakespeare,"Before me, she's a good wench."
Shakespeare,"She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me:"
Shakespeare,what o' that?
Shakespeare,I was adored once too.
Shakespeare,"Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for"
Shakespeare,more money.
Shakespeare,"If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out."
Shakespeare,"Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i'"
Shakespeare,"the end, call me cut."
Shakespeare,"If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will."
Shakespeare,"Come, come, I'll go burn some sack, 'tis too late"
Shakespeare,"to go to bed now: come, knight, come, knight."
Shakespeare,"Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and others"
Shakespeare,"Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends."
Shakespeare,"Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,"
Shakespeare,That old and antique song we heard last night:
Shakespeare,"Methought it did relieve my passion much,"
Shakespeare,More than light airs and recollected terms
Shakespeare,Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:
Shakespeare,"Come, but one verse."
Shakespeare,"He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it."
Shakespeare,Who was it?
Shakespeare,"Feste, the jester, my lord, a fool that the lady"
Shakespeare,Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.
Shakespeare,"Seek him out, and play the tune the while."
Shakespeare,Exit CURIO. Music plays
Shakespeare,"Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,"
Shakespeare,"In the sweet pangs of it remember me,"
Shakespeare,"For such as I am all true lovers are,"
Shakespeare,"Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,"
Shakespeare,Save in the constant image of the creature
Shakespeare,That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
Shakespeare,It gives a very echo to the seat
Shakespeare,Where Love is throned.
Shakespeare,Thou dost speak masterly:
Shakespeare,"My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye"
Shakespeare,Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:
Shakespeare,"Hath it not, boy?"
Shakespeare,"A little, by your favour."
Shakespeare,What kind of woman is't?
Shakespeare,Of your complexion.
Shakespeare,"She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?"
Shakespeare,"About your years, my lord."
Shakespeare,Too old by heaven: let still the woman take
Shakespeare,"An elder than herself: so wears she to him,"
Shakespeare,So sways she level in her husband's heart:
Shakespeare,"For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,"
Shakespeare,"Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,"
Shakespeare,"More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,"
Shakespeare,Than women's are.
Shakespeare,"I think it well, my lord."
Shakespeare,"Then let thy love be younger than thyself,"
Shakespeare,"Or thy affection cannot hold the bent,"
Shakespeare,"For women are as roses, whose fair flower"
Shakespeare,"Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour."
Shakespeare,"And so they are: alas, that they are so,"
Shakespeare,"To die, even when they to perfection grow!"
Shakespeare,Re-enter CURIO and Clown
Shakespeare,"O, fellow, come, the song we had last night."
Shakespeare,"Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain,"
Shakespeare,The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
Shakespeare,And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
Shakespeare,"Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,"
Shakespeare,"And dallies with the innocence of love,"
Shakespeare,Like the old age.
Shakespeare,"Are you ready, sir?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, prithee, sing."
Shakespeare,"Come away, come away, death,"
Shakespeare,"And in sad cypress let me be laid,"
Shakespeare,"Fly away, fly away breath,"
Shakespeare,I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
Shakespeare,"My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,"
Shakespeare,"O, prepare it!"
Shakespeare,"My part of death, no one so true"
Shakespeare,Did share it.
Shakespeare,"Not a flower, not a flower sweet"
Shakespeare,"On my black coffin let there be strown,"
Shakespeare,"Not a friend, not a friend greet"
Shakespeare,"My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:"
Shakespeare,"A thousand thousand sighs to save,"
Shakespeare,"Lay me, O, where"
Shakespeare,"Sad true lover never find my grave,"
Shakespeare,To weep there!
Shakespeare,"No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir."
Shakespeare,I'll pay thy pleasure then.
Shakespeare,"Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another."
Shakespeare,Give me now leave to leave thee.
Shakespeare,"Now, the melancholy god protect thee, and the"
Shakespeare,"tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for"
Shakespeare,thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
Shakespeare,"constancy put to sea, that their business might be"
Shakespeare,"every thing and their intent every where, for that's"
Shakespeare,it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
Shakespeare,Let all the rest give place.
Shakespeare,CURIO and Attendants retire
Shakespeare,"Once more, Cesario,"
Shakespeare,Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
Shakespeare,"Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,"
Shakespeare,"Prizes not quantity of dirty lands,"
Shakespeare,"The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,"
Shakespeare,"Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune,"
Shakespeare,But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
Shakespeare,That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
Shakespeare,"But if she cannot love you, sir?"
Shakespeare,I cannot be so answer'd.
Shakespeare,"Sooth, but you must."
Shakespeare,"Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,"
Shakespeare,Hath for your love a great a pang of heart
Shakespeare,"As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her,"
Shakespeare,"You tell her so, must she not then be answer'd?"
Shakespeare,There is no woman's sides
Shakespeare,Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
Shakespeare,"As love doth give my heart, no woman's heart"
Shakespeare,"So big, to hold so much, they lack retention"
Shakespeare,"Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,"
Shakespeare,"No motion of the liver, but the palate,"
Shakespeare,"That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt,"
Shakespeare,"But mine is all as hungry as the sea,"
Shakespeare,And can digest as much: make no compare
Shakespeare,Between that love a woman can bear me
Shakespeare,And that I owe Olivia.
Shakespeare,"Ay, but I know--"
Shakespeare,What dost thou know?
Shakespeare,What dost thou know?
Shakespeare,Too well what love women to men may owe:
Shakespeare,"In faith, they are as true of heart as we."
Shakespeare,"My father had a daughter loved a man,"
Shakespeare,"As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,"
Shakespeare,I should your lordship.
Shakespeare,And what's her history?
Shakespeare,"A blank, my lord. She never told her love,"
Shakespeare,"But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,"
Shakespeare,"Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,"
Shakespeare,And with a green and yellow melancholy
Shakespeare,"She sat like patience on a monument,"
Shakespeare,Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
Shakespeare,"We men may say more, swear more: but indeed"
Shakespeare,"Our shows are more than will, for still we prove"
Shakespeare,"Much in our vows, but little in our love."
Shakespeare,"But died thy sister of her love, my boy?"
Shakespeare,"I am all the daughters of my father's house,"
Shakespeare,And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
Shakespeare,"Sir, shall I to this lady?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, that's the theme."
Shakespeare,"To her in haste, give her this jewel, say,"
Shakespeare,"My love can give no place, bide no denay."
Shakespeare,SCENE V. OLIVIA's garden.
Shakespeare,"Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN"
Shakespeare,"Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN"
Shakespeare,"Come thy ways, Signior Fabian."
Shakespeare,"Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,"
Shakespeare,let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
Shakespeare,Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly
Shakespeare,rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
Shakespeare,"I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'"
Shakespeare,favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
Shakespeare,"To anger him we'll have the bear again, and we will"
Shakespeare,"fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?"
Shakespeare,"An we do not, it is pity of our lives."
Shakespeare,Here comes the little villain.
Shakespeare,"How now, my metal of India!"
Shakespeare,Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's
Shakespeare,coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the
Shakespeare,sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half
Shakespeare,"hour: observe him, for the love of mockery, for I"
Shakespeare,know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
Shakespeare,"him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,"
Shakespeare,Throws down a letter
Shakespeare,for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.
Shakespeare,"'Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once told"
Shakespeare,me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come
Shakespeare,"thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one"
Shakespeare,"of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more"
Shakespeare,exalted respect than any one else that follows her.
Shakespeare,What should I think on't?
Shakespeare,Here's an overweening rogue!
Shakespeare,"O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock"
Shakespeare,of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!
Shakespeare,"'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!"
Shakespeare,"Peace, I say."
Shakespeare,To be Count Malvolio!
Shakespeare,"Ah, rogue!"
Shakespeare,"Pistol him, pistol him."
Shakespeare,"There is example for't, the lady of the Strachy"
Shakespeare,married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
Shakespeare,"Fie on him, Jezebel!"
Shakespeare,"O, peace! now he's deeply in: look how"
Shakespeare,imagination blows him.
Shakespeare,"Having been three months married to her, sitting in"
Shakespeare,"my state,--"
Shakespeare,"O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!"
Shakespeare,"Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet"
Shakespeare,"gown, having come from a day-bed, where I have left"
Shakespeare,"Olivia sleeping,--"
Shakespeare,"O, peace, peace!"
Shakespeare,"And then to have the humour of state, and after a"
Shakespeare,"demure travel of regard, telling them I know my"
Shakespeare,"place as I would they should do theirs, to for my"
Shakespeare,"kinsman Toby,--"
Shakespeare,Bolts and shackles!
Shakespeare,"O peace, peace, peace! now, now."
Shakespeare,"Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make"
Shakespeare,"out for him: I frown the while, and perchance wind"
Shakespeare,"up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby"
Shakespeare,"approaches, courtesies there to me,--"
Shakespeare,Shall this fellow live?
Shakespeare,"Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace."
Shakespeare,"I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar"
Shakespeare,"smile with an austere regard of control,--"
Shakespeare,And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
Shakespeare,"Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on"
Shakespeare,"your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--"
Shakespeare,'You must amend your drunkenness.'
Shakespeare,"Out, scab!"
Shakespeare,"Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot."
Shakespeare,"'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with"
Shakespeare,"a foolish knight,'--"
Shakespeare,"That's me, I warrant you."
Shakespeare,"'One Sir Andrew,'--"
Shakespeare,"I knew 'twas I, for many do call me fool."
Shakespeare,What employment have we here?
Shakespeare,Taking up the letter
Shakespeare,Now is the woodcock near the gin.
Shakespeare,"O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading"
Shakespeare,aloud to him!
Shakespeare,"By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her"
Shakespeare,"very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her"
Shakespeare,"great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand."
Shakespeare,"Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?"
Shakespeare,"[Reads]  'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good"
Shakespeare,"wishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave, wax."
Shakespeare,"Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she"
Shakespeare,uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?
Shakespeare,"This wins him, liver and all."
Shakespeare,Jove knows I love: But who?
Shakespeare,"Lips, do not move,"
Shakespeare,No man must know.
Shakespeare,'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers
Shakespeare,altered! 'No man must know:' if this should be
Shakespeare,"thee, Malvolio?"
Shakespeare,"Marry, hang thee, brock!"
Shakespeare,"I may command where I adore,"
Shakespeare,"But silence, like a Lucrece knife,"
Shakespeare,With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:
Shakespeare,"M, O, A, I, doth sway my life."
Shakespeare,A fustian riddle!
Shakespeare,"Excellent wench, say I."
Shakespeare,"'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let"
Shakespeare,"me see, let me see, let me see."
Shakespeare,What dish o' poison has she dressed him!
Shakespeare,And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!
Shakespeare,"'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command"
Shakespeare,"me: I serve her, she is my lady. Why, this is"
Shakespeare,"evident to any formal capacity, there is no"
Shakespeare,"obstruction in this: and the end,--what should"
Shakespeare,that alphabetical position portend? If I could make
Shakespeare,"that resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,"
Shakespeare,"I,--"
Shakespeare,"O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent."
Shakespeare,"Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as"
Shakespeare,rank as a fox.
Shakespeare,"M,--Malvolio, M,--why, that begins my name."
Shakespeare,Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is
Shakespeare,excellent at faults.
Shakespeare,"M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel,"
Shakespeare,that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.
Shakespeare,"And O shall end, I hope."
Shakespeare,"Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!"
Shakespeare,And then I comes behind.
Shakespeare,"Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see"
Shakespeare,more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
Shakespeare,"M, O, A, I, this simulation is not as the former: and"
Shakespeare,"yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for"
Shakespeare,every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!
Shakespeare,here follows prose.
Shakespeare,"'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I"
Shakespeare,"am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness: some"
Shakespeare,"are born great, some achieve greatness, and some"
Shakespeare,have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open
Shakespeare,"their hands, let thy blood and spirit embrace them,"
Shakespeare,"and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,"
Shakespeare,cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
Shakespeare,"opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants, let"
Shakespeare,"thy tongue tang arguments of state, put thyself into"
Shakespeare,the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
Shakespeare,that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
Shakespeare,"yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever"
Shakespeare,"cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art"
Shakespeare,"made, if thou desirest to be so, if not, let me see"
Shakespeare,"thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and"
Shakespeare,not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.
Shakespeare,"She that would alter services with thee,"
Shakespeare,THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'
Shakespeare,Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
Shakespeare,"open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,"
Shakespeare,"I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross"
Shakespeare,"acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man."
Shakespeare,"I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade"
Shakespeare,"me, for every reason excites to this, that my lady"
Shakespeare,loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
Shakespeare,"late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered,"
Shakespeare,"and in this she manifests herself to my love, and"
Shakespeare,with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
Shakespeare,of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
Shakespeare,"be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and"
Shakespeare,"cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting"
Shakespeare,on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
Shakespeare,postscript.
Shakespeare,'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
Shakespeare,"entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling,"
Shakespeare,"thy smiles become thee well, therefore in my"
Shakespeare,"presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'"
Shakespeare,"Jove, I thank thee: I will smile, I will do"
Shakespeare,everything that thou wilt have me.
Shakespeare,I will not give my part of this sport for a pension
Shakespeare,of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
Shakespeare,I could marry this wench for this device.
Shakespeare,So could I too.
Shakespeare,And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
Shakespeare,Nor I neither.
Shakespeare,Here comes my noble gull-catcher.
Shakespeare,Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
Shakespeare,Or o' mine either?
Shakespeare,"Shall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thy"
Shakespeare,bond-slave?
Shakespeare,"I' faith, or I either?"
Shakespeare,"Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when"
Shakespeare,the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
Shakespeare,"Nay, but say true, does it work upon him?"
Shakespeare,Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.
Shakespeare,"If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark"
Shakespeare,his first approach before my lady: he will come to
Shakespeare,"her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she"
Shakespeare,"abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests,"
Shakespeare,"and he will smile upon her, which will now be so"
Shakespeare,"unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a"
Shakespeare,"melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him"
Shakespeare,"into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow"
Shakespeare,me.
Shakespeare,me.
Shakespeare,"To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!"
Shakespeare,I'll make one too.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. OLIVIA's garden.
Shakespeare,"Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabour"
Shakespeare,"Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by"
Shakespeare,thy tabour?
Shakespeare,"No, sir, I live by the church."
Shakespeare,Art thou a churchman?
Shakespeare,"No such matter, sir: I do live by the church, for"
Shakespeare,"I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by"
Shakespeare,the church.
Shakespeare,"So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a"
Shakespeare,"beggar dwell near him, or, the church stands by thy"
Shakespeare,"tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church."
Shakespeare,"You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is"
Shakespeare,but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
Shakespeare,wrong side may be turned outward!
Shakespeare,"Nay, that's certain, they that dally nicely with"
Shakespeare,words may quickly make them wanton.
Shakespeare,"I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir."
Shakespeare,"Why, sir, her name's a word, and to dally with that"
Shakespeare,word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
Shakespeare,are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.
Shakespeare,"Thy reason, man?"
Shakespeare,"Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and"
Shakespeare,"words are grown so false, I am loath to prove"
Shakespeare,reason with them.
Shakespeare,I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
Shakespeare,"Not so, sir, I do care for something, but in my"
Shakespeare,"conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be"
Shakespeare,"to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible."
Shakespeare,Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?
Shakespeare,"No, indeed, sir, the Lady Olivia has no folly: she"
Shakespeare,"will keep no fool, sir, till she be married, and"
Shakespeare,fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
Shakespeare,"herrings, the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not"
Shakespeare,"her fool, but her corrupter of words."
Shakespeare,I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.
Shakespeare,"Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,"
Shakespeare,"it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but"
Shakespeare,the fool should be as oft with your master as with
Shakespeare,my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.
Shakespeare,"Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee."
Shakespeare,"Hold, there's expenses for thee."
Shakespeare,"Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!"
Shakespeare,"By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for"
Shakespeare,"one,"
Shakespeare,though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy
Shakespeare,lady within?
Shakespeare,"Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?"
Shakespeare,"Yes, being kept together and put to use."
Shakespeare,"I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring"
Shakespeare,a Cressida to this Troilus.
Shakespeare,"I understand you, sir, 'tis well begged."
Shakespeare,"The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but"
Shakespeare,a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
Shakespeare,"within, sir. I will construe to them whence you"
Shakespeare,"come, who you are and what you would are out of my"
Shakespeare,"welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn."
Shakespeare,"This fellow is wise enough to play the fool,"
Shakespeare,And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
Shakespeare,"He must observe their mood on whom he jests,"
Shakespeare,"The quality of persons, and the time,"
Shakespeare,"And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather"
Shakespeare,That comes before his eye. This is a practise
Shakespeare,As full of labour as a wise man's art
Shakespeare,"For folly that he wisely shows is fit,"
Shakespeare,"But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit."
Shakespeare,"Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW"
Shakespeare,"Save you, gentleman."
Shakespeare,"And you, sir."
Shakespeare,"And you, sir."
Shakespeare,"Dieu vous garde, monsieur."
Shakespeare,"Et vous aussi, votre serviteur."
Shakespeare,"I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours."
Shakespeare,Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous
Shakespeare,"you should enter, if your trade be to her."
Shakespeare,"I am bound to your niece, sir, I mean, she is the"
Shakespeare,list of my voyage.
Shakespeare,"Taste your legs, sir, put them to motion."
Shakespeare,"My legs do better understand me, sir, than I"
Shakespeare,understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.
Shakespeare,"I mean, to go, sir, to enter."
Shakespeare,I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we
Shakespeare,are prevented.
Shakespeare,Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
Shakespeare,Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
Shakespeare,"Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain"
Shakespeare,odours on you!
Shakespeare,"That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours,' well."
Shakespeare,"My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant"
Shakespeare,and vouchsafed ear.
Shakespeare,"'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em"
Shakespeare,all three all ready.
Shakespeare,"Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing."
Shakespeare,"Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and MARIA"
Shakespeare,"Give me your hand, sir."
Shakespeare,"My duty, madam, and most humble service."
Shakespeare,"Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess."
Shakespeare,"My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world"
Shakespeare,Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:
Shakespeare,"You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth."
Shakespeare,"And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:"
Shakespeare,"Your servant's servant is your servant, madam."
Shakespeare,"For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,"
Shakespeare,"Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!"
Shakespeare,"Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts"
Shakespeare,On his behalf.
Shakespeare,"O, by your leave, I pray you,"
Shakespeare,I bade you never speak again of him:
Shakespeare,"But, would you undertake another suit,"
Shakespeare,I had rather hear you to solicit that
Shakespeare,Than music from the spheres.
Shakespeare,"Dear lady,--"
Shakespeare,"Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,"
Shakespeare,"After the last enchantment you did here,"
Shakespeare,A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
Shakespeare,"Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:"
Shakespeare,"Under your hard construction must I sit,"
Shakespeare,"To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,"
Shakespeare,Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
Shakespeare,Have you not set mine honour at the stake
Shakespeare,And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
Shakespeare,That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
Shakespeare,"Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,"
Shakespeare,"Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak."
Shakespeare,I pity you.
Shakespeare,That's a degree to love.
Shakespeare,"No, not a grize, for 'tis a vulgar proof,"
Shakespeare,That very oft we pity enemies.
Shakespeare,"Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again."
Shakespeare,"O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!"
Shakespeare,"If one should be a prey, how much the better"
Shakespeare,To fall before the lion than the wolf!
Shakespeare,The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
Shakespeare,"Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:"
Shakespeare,"And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,"
Shakespeare,Your were is alike to reap a proper man:
Shakespeare,"There lies your way, due west."
Shakespeare,Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition
Shakespeare,Attend your ladyship!
Shakespeare,"You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?"
Shakespeare,"I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me."
Shakespeare,That you do think you are not what you are.
Shakespeare,"If I think so, I think the same of you."
Shakespeare,Then think you right: I am not what I am.
Shakespeare,I would you were as I would have you be!
Shakespeare,"Would it be better, madam, than I am?"
Shakespeare,"I wish it might, for now I am your fool."
Shakespeare,"O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful"
Shakespeare,In the contempt and anger of his lip!
Shakespeare,A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
Shakespeare,Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
Shakespeare,"Cesario, by the roses of the spring,"
Shakespeare,"By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,"
Shakespeare,"I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,"
Shakespeare,Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
Shakespeare,"Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,"
Shakespeare,"For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,"
Shakespeare,"But rather reason thus with reason fetter,"
Shakespeare,"Love sought is good, but given unsought better."
Shakespeare,"By innocence I swear, and by my youth"
Shakespeare,"I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,"
Shakespeare,"And that no woman has, nor never none"
Shakespeare,"Shall mistress be of it, save I alone."
Shakespeare,"And so adieu, good madam: never more"
Shakespeare,Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
Shakespeare,"Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move"
Shakespeare,"That heart, which now abhors, to like his love."
Shakespeare,SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.
Shakespeare,"No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer."
Shakespeare,"Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason."
Shakespeare,"You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew."
Shakespeare,"Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the"
Shakespeare,"count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me,"
Shakespeare,I saw't i' the orchard.
Shakespeare,"Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that."
Shakespeare,As plain as I see you now.
Shakespeare,This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
Shakespeare,"'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?"
Shakespeare,"I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of"
Shakespeare,judgment and reason.
Shakespeare,And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah
Shakespeare,was a sailor.
Shakespeare,She did show favour to the youth in your sight only
Shakespeare,"to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to"
Shakespeare,put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
Shakespeare,"You should then have accosted her, and with some"
Shakespeare,"excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should"
Shakespeare,have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
Shakespeare,"looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the"
Shakespeare,double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
Shakespeare,"off, and you are now sailed into the north of my"
Shakespeare,"lady's opinion, where you will hang like an icicle"
Shakespeare,"on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by"
Shakespeare,some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.
Shakespeare,"An't be any way, it must be with valour, for policy"
Shakespeare,I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a
Shakespeare,politician.
Shakespeare,"Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of"
Shakespeare,valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
Shakespeare,"with him, hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall"
Shakespeare,"take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no"
Shakespeare,love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's
Shakespeare,commendation with woman than report of valour.
Shakespeare,"There is no way but this, Sir Andrew."
Shakespeare,Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
Shakespeare,"Go, write it in a martial hand, be curst and brief,"
Shakespeare,"it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun"
Shakespeare,of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:
Shakespeare,"if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be"
Shakespeare,"amiss, and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of"
Shakespeare,"paper, although the sheet were big enough for the"
Shakespeare,"bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it."
Shakespeare,"Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou"
Shakespeare,"write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it."
Shakespeare,Where shall I find you?
Shakespeare,We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.
Shakespeare,Exit SIR ANDREW
Shakespeare,"This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby."
Shakespeare,"I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand"
Shakespeare,"strong, or so."
Shakespeare,We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll
Shakespeare,not deliver't?
Shakespeare,"Never trust me, then, and by all means stir on the"
Shakespeare,youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes
Shakespeare,"cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were"
Shakespeare,"opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as"
Shakespeare,"will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of"
Shakespeare,the anatomy.
Shakespeare,"And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no"
Shakespeare,great presage of cruelty.
Shakespeare,"Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes."
Shakespeare,"If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself"
Shakespeare,"into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is"
Shakespeare,"turned heathen, a very renegado, for there is no"
Shakespeare,"Christian, that means to be saved by believing"
Shakespeare,"rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages"
Shakespeare,of grossness. He's in yellow stockings.
Shakespeare,And cross-gartered?
Shakespeare,"Most villanously, like a pedant that keeps a school"
Shakespeare,"i' the church. I have dogged him, like his"
Shakespeare,murderer. He does obey every point of the letter
Shakespeare,that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his
Shakespeare,face into more lines than is in the new map with the
Shakespeare,augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such
Shakespeare,a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things
Shakespeare,"at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,"
Shakespeare,he'll smile and take't for a great favour.
Shakespeare,"Come, bring us, bring us where he is."
Shakespeare,Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
Shakespeare,"I would not by my will have troubled you,"
Shakespeare,"But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,"
Shakespeare,I will no further chide you.
Shakespeare,"I could not stay behind you: my desire,"
Shakespeare,"More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth,"
Shakespeare,"And not all love to see you, though so much"
Shakespeare,"As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,"
Shakespeare,"But jealousy what might befall your travel,"
Shakespeare,"Being skilless in these parts, which to a stranger,"
Shakespeare,"Unguided and unfriended, often prove"
Shakespeare,"Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,"
Shakespeare,"The rather by these arguments of fear,"
Shakespeare,Set forth in your pursuit.
Shakespeare,"My kind Antonio,"
Shakespeare,"I can no other answer make but thanks,"
Shakespeare,"And thanks, and ever [         ] oft good turns"
Shakespeare,Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:
Shakespeare,"But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,"
Shakespeare,You should find better dealing. What's to do?
Shakespeare,Shall we go see the reliques of this town?
Shakespeare,"To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging."
Shakespeare,"I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:"
Shakespeare,"I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes"
Shakespeare,With the memorials and the things of fame
Shakespeare,That do renown this city.
Shakespeare,"Would you'ld pardon me,"
Shakespeare,I do not without danger walk these streets:
Shakespeare,"Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys"
Shakespeare,"I did some service, of such note indeed,"
Shakespeare,That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.
Shakespeare,Belike you slew great number of his people.
Shakespeare,"The offence is not of such a bloody nature,"
Shakespeare,Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
Shakespeare,Might well have given us bloody argument.
Shakespeare,It might have since been answer'd in repaying
Shakespeare,"What we took from them, which, for traffic's sake,"
Shakespeare,"Most of our city did: only myself stood out,"
Shakespeare,"For which, if I be lapsed in this place,"
Shakespeare,I shall pay dear.
Shakespeare,Do not then walk too open.
Shakespeare,"It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse."
Shakespeare,"In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,"
Shakespeare,"Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,"
Shakespeare,Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
Shakespeare,With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.
Shakespeare,Why I your purse?
Shakespeare,Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
Shakespeare,"You have desire to purchase, and your store,"
Shakespeare,"I think, is not for idle markets, sir."
Shakespeare,I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you
Shakespeare,For an hour.
Shakespeare,To the Elephant.
Shakespeare,I do remember.
Shakespeare,SCENE IV. OLIVIA's garden.
Shakespeare,"I have sent after him: he says he'll come,"
Shakespeare,How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?
Shakespeare,For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
Shakespeare,I speak too loud.
Shakespeare,"Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,"
Shakespeare,And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:
Shakespeare,Where is Malvolio?
Shakespeare,"He's coming, madam, but in very strange manner. He"
Shakespeare,"is, sure, possessed, madam."
Shakespeare,"Why, what's the matter? does he rave?"
Shakespeare,"No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your"
Shakespeare,"ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if"
Shakespeare,"he come, for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits."
Shakespeare,Go call him hither.
Shakespeare,"I am as mad as he,"
Shakespeare,If sad and merry madness equal be.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO"
Shakespeare,"How now, Malvolio!"
Shakespeare,"How now, Malvolio!"
Shakespeare,"Sweet lady, ho, ho."
Shakespeare,Smilest thou?
Shakespeare,I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
Shakespeare,"Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some"
Shakespeare,"obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering, but"
Shakespeare,"what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is"
Shakespeare,"with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and"
Shakespeare,please all.'
Shakespeare,"Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?"
Shakespeare,"Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It"
Shakespeare,"did come to his hands, and commands shall be"
Shakespeare,executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
Shakespeare,"Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?"
Shakespeare,"To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee."
Shakespeare,God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss
Shakespeare,thy hand so oft?
Shakespeare,"How do you, Malvolio?"
Shakespeare,"At your request! yes, nightingales answer daws."
Shakespeare,Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
Shakespeare,'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.
Shakespeare,"What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?"
Shakespeare,"'Some are born great,'--"
Shakespeare,"'Some achieve greatness,'--"
Shakespeare,'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'
Shakespeare,Heaven restore thee!
Shakespeare,"'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--"
Shakespeare,Thy yellow stockings!
Shakespeare,'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'
Shakespeare,Cross-gartered!
Shakespeare,"'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so,'--"
Shakespeare,Am I made?
Shakespeare,"'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'"
Shakespeare,"Why, this is very midsummer madness."
Shakespeare,"Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is"
Shakespeare,returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he
Shakespeare,attends your ladyship's pleasure.
Shakespeare,I'll come to him.
Shakespeare,"Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's"
Shakespeare,my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special
Shakespeare,care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the
Shakespeare,half of my dowry.
Shakespeare,Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA
Shakespeare,"O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than"
Shakespeare,Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with
Shakespeare,"the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may"
Shakespeare,"appear stubborn to him, for she incites me to that"
Shakespeare,"in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she,"
Shakespeare,"'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants,"
Shakespeare,"let thy tongue tang with arguments of state, put"
Shakespeare,"thyself into the trick of singularity,' and"
Shakespeare,"consequently sets down the manner how, as, a sad"
Shakespeare,"face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the"
Shakespeare,"habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have"
Shakespeare,"limed her, but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me"
Shakespeare,"thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this"
Shakespeare,"fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor"
Shakespeare,"after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing"
Shakespeare,"adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no"
Shakespeare,"scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous"
Shakespeare,or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing
Shakespeare,that can be can come between me and the full
Shakespeare,"prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the"
Shakespeare,"doer of this, and he is to be thanked."
Shakespeare,"Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN"
Shakespeare,"Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all"
Shakespeare,"the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion"
Shakespeare,"himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him."
Shakespeare,"Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?"
Shakespeare,"how is't with you, man?"
Shakespeare,"Go off, I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go"
Shakespeare,"Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not"
Shakespeare,"I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a"
Shakespeare,care of him.
Shakespeare,"Ah, ha! does she so?"
Shakespeare,"Go to, go to, peace, peace, we must deal gently"
Shakespeare,"with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how"
Shakespeare,"is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:"
Shakespeare,"consider, he's an enemy to mankind."
Shakespeare,Do you know what you say?
Shakespeare,"La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes"
Shakespeare,"it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!"
Shakespeare,Carry his water to the wise woman.
Shakespeare,"Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I"
Shakespeare,live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.
Shakespeare,"How now, mistress!"
Shakespeare,O Lord!
Shakespeare,"Prithee, hold thy peace, this is not the way: do"
Shakespeare,you not see you move him? let me alone with him.
Shakespeare,"No way but gentleness, gently, gently: the fiend is"
Shakespeare,"rough, and will not be roughly used."
Shakespeare,"Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?"
Shakespeare,Sir!
Shakespeare,"Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for"
Shakespeare,gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang
Shakespeare,"him, foul collier!"
Shakespeare,"Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray."
Shakespeare,"My prayers, minx!"
Shakespeare,"No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness."
Shakespeare,"Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow"
Shakespeare,things: I am not of your element: you shall know
Shakespeare,more hereafter.
Shakespeare,"If this were played upon a stage now, I could"
Shakespeare,condemn it as an improbable fiction.
Shakespeare,"His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man."
Shakespeare,"Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint."
Shakespeare,"Why, we shall make him mad indeed."
Shakespeare,The house will be the quieter.
Shakespeare,"Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My"
Shakespeare,niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we
Shakespeare,"may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,"
Shakespeare,"till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt"
Shakespeare,us to have mercy on him: at which time we will
Shakespeare,bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
Shakespeare,"finder of madmen. But see, but see."
Shakespeare,More matter for a May morning.
Shakespeare,"Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's"
Shakespeare,vinegar and pepper in't.
Shakespeare,Is't so saucy?
Shakespeare,"Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read."
Shakespeare,Give me.
Shakespeare,"'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'"
Shakespeare,"Good, and valiant."
Shakespeare,"[Reads]  'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,"
Shakespeare,"why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'"
Shakespeare,"A good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law."
Shakespeare,"[Reads]  'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my"
Shakespeare,sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy
Shakespeare,"throat, that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'"
Shakespeare,"Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less."
Shakespeare,"[Reads]  'I will waylay thee going home, where if it"
Shakespeare,"be thy chance to kill me,'--"
Shakespeare,[Reads]  'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'
Shakespeare,Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.
Shakespeare,"[Reads]  'Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon"
Shakespeare,"one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine, but"
Shakespeare,"my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy"
Shakespeare,"friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,"
Shakespeare,ANDREW AGUECHEEK.
Shakespeare,"If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:"
Shakespeare,I'll give't him.
Shakespeare,You may have very fit occasion for't: he is now in
Shakespeare,"some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart."
Shakespeare,"Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the"
Shakespeare,orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest
Shakespeare,"him, draw, and, as thou drawest swear horrible, for"
Shakespeare,"it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a"
Shakespeare,"swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood"
Shakespeare,more approbation than ever proof itself would have
Shakespeare,earned him. Away!
Shakespeare,"Nay, let me alone for swearing."
Shakespeare,Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behavior
Shakespeare,of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
Shakespeare,"capacity and breeding, his employment between his"
Shakespeare,lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this
Shakespeare,"letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no"
Shakespeare,terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a
Shakespeare,"clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by"
Shakespeare,"word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable report"
Shakespeare,"of valour, and drive the gentleman, as I know his"
Shakespeare,"youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous"
Shakespeare,"opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity."
Shakespeare,This will so fright them both that they will kill
Shakespeare,"one another by the look, like cockatrices."
Shakespeare,"Re-enter OLIVIA, with VIOLA"
Shakespeare,Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
Shakespeare,"he take leave, and presently after him."
Shakespeare,I will meditate the while upon some horrid message
Shakespeare,for a challenge.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, FABIAN, and MARIA"
Shakespeare,I have said too much unto a heart of stone
Shakespeare,And laid mine honour too unchary out:
Shakespeare,"There's something in me that reproves my fault,"
Shakespeare,"But such a headstrong potent fault it is,"
Shakespeare,That it but mocks reproof.
Shakespeare,With the same 'havior that your passion bears
Shakespeare,Goes on my master's grief.
Shakespeare,"Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture,"
Shakespeare,"Refuse it not, it hath no tongue to vex you,"
Shakespeare,And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
Shakespeare,"What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,"
Shakespeare,That honour saved may upon asking give?
Shakespeare,"Nothing but this, your true love for my master."
Shakespeare,How with mine honour may I give him that
Shakespeare,Which I have given to you?
Shakespeare,I will acquit you.
Shakespeare,"Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:"
Shakespeare,A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
Shakespeare,Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN
Shakespeare,"Gentleman, God save thee."
Shakespeare,"That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what"
Shakespeare,"nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know"
Shakespeare,"not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as"
Shakespeare,"the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:"
Shakespeare,"dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for"
Shakespeare,"thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly."
Shakespeare,"You mistake, sir, I am sure no man hath any quarrel"
Shakespeare,to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from
Shakespeare,any image of offence done to any man.
Shakespeare,"You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,"
Shakespeare,"if you hold your life at any price, betake you to"
Shakespeare,"your guard, for your opposite hath in him what"
Shakespeare,"youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal."
Shakespeare,"I pray you, sir, what is he?"
Shakespeare,"He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on"
Shakespeare,"carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private"
Shakespeare,"brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and"
Shakespeare,"his incensement at this moment is so implacable,"
Shakespeare,that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
Shakespeare,"and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word, give't or take't."
Shakespeare,I will return again into the house and desire some
Shakespeare,conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
Shakespeare,of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
Shakespeare,"others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man"
Shakespeare,of that quirk.
Shakespeare,"Sir, no, his indignation derives itself out of a"
Shakespeare,"very competent injury: therefore, get you on and"
Shakespeare,give him his desire. Back you shall not to the
Shakespeare,"house, unless you undertake that with me which with"
Shakespeare,"as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,"
Shakespeare,"or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you"
Shakespeare,"must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you."
Shakespeare,"This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me"
Shakespeare,"this courteous office, as to know of the knight what"
Shakespeare,my offence to him is: it is something of my
Shakespeare,"negligence, nothing of my purpose."
Shakespeare,"I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this"
Shakespeare,gentleman till my return.
Shakespeare,"Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?"
Shakespeare,"I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a"
Shakespeare,"mortal arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more."
Shakespeare,"I beseech you, what manner of man is he?"
Shakespeare,"Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by"
Shakespeare,"his form, as you are like to find him in the proof"
Shakespeare,"of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,"
Shakespeare,bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
Shakespeare,have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
Shakespeare,towards him? I will make your peace with him if I
Shakespeare,can.
Shakespeare,I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that
Shakespeare,had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
Shakespeare,care not who knows so much of my mettle.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW"
Shakespeare,"Why, man, he's a very devil, I have not seen such a"
Shakespeare,"firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and"
Shakespeare,"all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal"
Shakespeare,"motion, that it is inevitable, and on the answer, he"
Shakespeare,pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
Shakespeare,step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
Shakespeare,"Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him."
Shakespeare,"Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can"
Shakespeare,scarce hold him yonder.
Shakespeare,"Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so"
Shakespeare,"cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld"
Shakespeare,"have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,"
Shakespeare,"and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet."
Shakespeare,"I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show"
Shakespeare,on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.
Shakespeare,"Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you."
Shakespeare,Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA
Shakespeare,To FABIAN
Shakespeare,To FABIAN
Shakespeare,I have his horse to take up the quarrel:
Shakespeare,I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
Shakespeare,"He is as horribly conceited of him, and pants and"
Shakespeare,"looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels."
Shakespeare,"[To VIOLA]  There's no remedy, sir, he will fight"
Shakespeare,"with you for's oath sake: marry, he hath better"
Shakespeare,"bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now"
Shakespeare,"scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for"
Shakespeare,"the supportance of his vow, he protests he will not hurt you."
Shakespeare,[Aside]  Pray God defend me! A little thing would
Shakespeare,make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
Shakespeare,"Give ground, if you see him furious."
Shakespeare,"Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy, the gentleman"
Shakespeare,"will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you,"
Shakespeare,he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has
Shakespeare,"promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he"
Shakespeare,"will not hurt you. Come on, to't."
Shakespeare,"Pray God, he keep his oath!"
Shakespeare,"I do assure you, 'tis against my will."
Shakespeare,Put up your sword. If this young gentleman
Shakespeare,"Have done offence, I take the fault on me:"
Shakespeare,"If you offend him, I for him defy you."
Shakespeare,"You, sir! why, what are you?"
Shakespeare,"One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more"
Shakespeare,Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
Shakespeare,"Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you."
Shakespeare,Enter Officers
Shakespeare,"O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers."
Shakespeare,I'll be with you anon.
Shakespeare,"Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please."
Shakespeare,"Marry, will I, sir, and, for that I promised you,"
Shakespeare,I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily
Shakespeare,and reins well.
Shakespeare,"This is the man, do thy office."
Shakespeare,"Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino."
Shakespeare,"You do mistake me, sir."
Shakespeare,"No, sir, no jot, I know your favour well,"
Shakespeare,Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.
Shakespeare,Take him away: he knows I know him well.
Shakespeare,To VIOLA
Shakespeare,To VIOLA
Shakespeare,To VIOLA
Shakespeare,This comes with seeking you:
Shakespeare,"But there's no remedy, I shall answer it."
Shakespeare,"What will you do, now my necessity"
Shakespeare,Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
Shakespeare,Much more for what I cannot do for you
Shakespeare,"Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed,"
Shakespeare,But be of comfort.
Shakespeare,"Come, sir, away."
Shakespeare,I must entreat of you some of that money.
Shakespeare,"What money, sir?"
Shakespeare,"For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,"
Shakespeare,"And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,"
Shakespeare,Out of my lean and low ability
Shakespeare,"I'll lend you something: my having is not much,"
Shakespeare,I'll make division of my present with you:
Shakespeare,"Hold, there's half my coffer."
Shakespeare,Will you deny me now?
Shakespeare,Is't possible that my deserts to you
Shakespeare,"Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,"
Shakespeare,Lest that it make me so unsound a man
Shakespeare,As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
Shakespeare,That I have done for you.
Shakespeare,"I know of none,"
Shakespeare,Nor know I you by voice or any feature:
Shakespeare,I hate ingratitude more in a man
Shakespeare,"Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,"
Shakespeare,Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
Shakespeare,Inhabits our frail blood.
Shakespeare,O heavens themselves!
Shakespeare,"Come, sir, I pray you, go."
Shakespeare,Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
Shakespeare,"I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,"
Shakespeare,"Relieved him with such sanctity of love,"
Shakespeare,"And to his image, which methought did promise"
Shakespeare,"Most venerable worth, did I devotion."
Shakespeare,What's that to us? The time goes by: away!
Shakespeare,But O how vile an idol proves this god
Shakespeare,"Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame."
Shakespeare,"In nature there's no blemish but the mind,"
Shakespeare,None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
Shakespeare,"Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil"
Shakespeare,Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.
Shakespeare,"The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir."
Shakespeare,Lead me on.
Shakespeare,Exit with Officers
Shakespeare,"Methinks his words do from such passion fly,"
Shakespeare,That he believes himself: so do not I.
Shakespeare,"Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,"
Shakespeare,"That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!"
Shakespeare,"Come hither, knight, come hither, Fabian: we'll"
Shakespeare,whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
Shakespeare,He named Sebastian: I my brother know
Shakespeare,"Yet living in my glass, even such and so"
Shakespeare,"In favour was my brother, and he went"
Shakespeare,"Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,"
Shakespeare,"For him I imitate: O, if it prove,"
Shakespeare,Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.
Shakespeare,"A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than"
Shakespeare,a hare: his dishonesty appears in leaving his
Shakespeare,"friend here in necessity and denying him, and for"
Shakespeare,"his cowardship, ask Fabian."
Shakespeare,"A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it."
Shakespeare,"'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him."
Shakespeare,"Do, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword."
Shakespeare,"An I do not,--"
Shakespeare,"Come, let's see the event."
Shakespeare,I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.
Shakespeare,Enter SEBASTIAN and Clown
Shakespeare,Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?
Shakespeare,"Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:"
Shakespeare,Let me be clear of thee.
Shakespeare,"Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you, nor"
Shakespeare,"I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come"
Shakespeare,"speak with her, nor your name is not Master Cesario,"
Shakespeare,nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.
Shakespeare,"I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou"
Shakespeare,know'st not me.
Shakespeare,Vent my folly! he has heard that word of some
Shakespeare,great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my
Shakespeare,"folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,"
Shakespeare,"will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy"
Shakespeare,strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my
Shakespeare,lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?
Shakespeare,"I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There's"
Shakespeare,"money for thee: if you tarry longer, I shall give"
Shakespeare,worse payment.
Shakespeare,"By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men"
Shakespeare,that give fools money get themselves a good
Shakespeare,report--after fourteen years' purchase.
Shakespeare,"Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY BELCH, and FABIAN"
Shakespeare,"Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you."
Shakespeare,"Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are all"
Shakespeare,the people mad?
Shakespeare,"Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house."
Shakespeare,This will I tell my lady straight: I would not be
Shakespeare,in some of your coats for two pence.
Shakespeare,"Come on, sir, hold."
Shakespeare,"Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to work"
Shakespeare,"with him, I'll have an action of battery against"
Shakespeare,"him, if there be any law in Illyria: though I"
Shakespeare,"struck him first, yet it's no matter for that."
Shakespeare,Let go thy hand.
Shakespeare,"Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young"
Shakespeare,"soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed, come on."
Shakespeare,I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If
Shakespeare,"thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword."
Shakespeare,"What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two"
Shakespeare,of this malapert blood from you.
Shakespeare,Enter OLIVIA
Shakespeare,"Hold, Toby, on thy life I charge thee, hold!"
Shakespeare,"Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,"
Shakespeare,"Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,"
Shakespeare,Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!
Shakespeare,"Be not offended, dear Cesario."
Shakespeare,"Rudesby, be gone!"
Shakespeare,"Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN"
Shakespeare,"I prithee, gentle friend,"
Shakespeare,"Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway"
Shakespeare,In this uncivil and thou unjust extent
Shakespeare,"Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,"
Shakespeare,And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
Shakespeare,"This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby"
Shakespeare,Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:
Shakespeare,"Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,"
Shakespeare,He started one poor heart of mine in thee.
Shakespeare,What relish is in this? how runs the stream?
Shakespeare,"Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:"
Shakespeare,"Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep,"
Shakespeare,"If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!"
Shakespeare,"Nay, come, I prithee, would thou'ldst be ruled by me!"
Shakespeare,"O, say so, and so be!"
Shakespeare,"Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard,"
Shakespeare,make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate: do
Shakespeare,"it quickly, I'll call Sir Toby the whilst."
Shakespeare,"Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself"
Shakespeare,"in't, and I would I were the first that ever"
Shakespeare,dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to
Shakespeare,"become the function well, nor lean enough to be"
Shakespeare,"thought a good student, but to be said an honest man"
Shakespeare,and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a
Shakespeare,careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.
Shakespeare,"Jove bless thee, master Parson."
Shakespeare,"Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of"
Shakespeare,"Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily"
Shakespeare,"said to a niece of King Gorboduc, 'That that is is,'"
Shakespeare,"so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson, for,"
Shakespeare,"what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?"
Shakespeare,"To him, Sir Topas."
Shakespeare,"What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!"
Shakespeare,"The knave counterfeits well, a good knave."
Shakespeare,[Within]  Who calls there?
Shakespeare,"Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio"
Shakespeare,the lunatic.
Shakespeare,"Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady."
Shakespeare,"Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man!"
Shakespeare,talkest thou nothing but of ladies?
Shakespeare,"Well said, Master Parson."
Shakespeare,"Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged: good Sir"
Shakespeare,"Topas, do not think I am mad: they have laid me"
Shakespeare,here in hideous darkness.
Shakespeare,"Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most"
Shakespeare,"modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones"
Shakespeare,that will use the devil himself with courtesy:
Shakespeare,sayest thou that house is dark?
Shakespeare,"As hell, Sir Topas."
Shakespeare,"Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,"
Shakespeare,and the clearstores toward the south north are as
Shakespeare,"lustrous as ebony, and yet complainest thou of"
Shakespeare,obstruction?
Shakespeare,"I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark."
Shakespeare,"Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no darkness"
Shakespeare,"but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than"
Shakespeare,the Egyptians in their fog.
Shakespeare,"I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though"
Shakespeare,"ignorance were as dark as hell, and I say, there"
Shakespeare,was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you
Shakespeare,are: make the trial of it in any constant question.
Shakespeare,What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?
Shakespeare,That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.
Shakespeare,What thinkest thou of his opinion?
Shakespeare,"I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion."
Shakespeare,Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness:
Shakespeare,thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will
Shakespeare,"allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest"
Shakespeare,thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.
Shakespeare,"Sir Topas, Sir Topas!"
Shakespeare,My most exquisite Sir Topas!
Shakespeare,"Nay, I am for all waters."
Shakespeare,Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and
Shakespeare,gown: he sees thee not.
Shakespeare,"To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how"
Shakespeare,thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this
Shakespeare,"knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I"
Shakespeare,"would he were, for I am now so far in offence with"
Shakespeare,my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this
Shakespeare,sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.
Shakespeare,Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA
Shakespeare,"'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,"
Shakespeare,Tell me how thy lady does.'
Shakespeare,Fool!
Shakespeare,Fool!
Shakespeare,"'My lady is unkind, perdy.'"
Shakespeare,"'Alas, why is she so?'"
Shakespeare,"Fool, I say!"
Shakespeare,"'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?"
Shakespeare,"Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my"
Shakespeare,"hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper:"
Shakespeare,"as I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to"
Shakespeare,thee for't.
Shakespeare,Master Malvolio?
Shakespeare,"Ay, good fool."
Shakespeare,"Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?"
Shakespeare,"Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I"
Shakespeare,"am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art."
Shakespeare,"But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no"
Shakespeare,better in your wits than a fool.
Shakespeare,"They have here propertied me, keep me in darkness,"
Shakespeare,"send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to"
Shakespeare,face me out of my wits.
Shakespeare,"Advise you what you say, the minister is here."
Shakespeare,"Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!"
Shakespeare,"endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain"
Shakespeare,bibble babble.
Shakespeare,Sir Topas!
Shakespeare,"Maintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I,"
Shakespeare,"sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas."
Shakespeare,"Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will."
Shakespeare,"Fool, fool, fool, I say!"
Shakespeare,"Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I am"
Shakespeare,shent for speaking to you.
Shakespeare,"Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: I"
Shakespeare,"tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria."
Shakespeare,"Well-a-day that you were, sir"
Shakespeare,"By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and"
Shakespeare,"light, and convey what I will set down to my lady:"
Shakespeare,it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing
Shakespeare,of letter did.
Shakespeare,"I will help you to't. But tell me true, are you"
Shakespeare,not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?
Shakespeare,"Believe me, I am not, I tell thee true."
Shakespeare,"Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his"
Shakespeare,brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.
Shakespeare,"Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I"
Shakespeare,"I am gone, sir,"
Shakespeare,"And anon, sir,"
Shakespeare,"I'll be with you again,"
Shakespeare,"In a trice,"
Shakespeare,"Like to the old Vice,"
Shakespeare,"Your need to sustain,"
Shakespeare,"Who, with dagger of lath,"
Shakespeare,"In his rage and his wrath,"
Shakespeare,"Cries, ah, ha! to the devil:"
Shakespeare,"Like a mad lad,"
Shakespeare,"Pare thy nails, dad,"
Shakespeare,"Adieu, good man devil."

Shakespeare,Enter SEBASTIAN
Shakespeare,Enter SEBASTIAN
Shakespeare,"This is the air, that is the glorious sun,"
Shakespeare,"This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't,"
Shakespeare,"And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,"
Shakespeare,"Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?"
Shakespeare,I could not find him at the Elephant:
Shakespeare,"Yet there he was, and there I found this credit,"
Shakespeare,That he did range the town to seek me out.
Shakespeare,"His counsel now might do me golden service,"
Shakespeare,"For though my soul disputes well with my sense,"
Shakespeare,"That this may be some error, but no madness,"
Shakespeare,Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
Shakespeare,"So far exceed all instance, all discourse,"
Shakespeare,That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
Shakespeare,And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
Shakespeare,To any other trust but that I am mad
Shakespeare,"Or else the lady's mad, yet, if 'twere so,"
Shakespeare,"She could not sway her house, command her followers,"
Shakespeare,Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
Shakespeare,"With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing"
Shakespeare,As I perceive she does: there's something in't
Shakespeare,That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.
Shakespeare,Enter OLIVIA and Priest
Shakespeare,"Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,"
Shakespeare,Now go with me and with this holy man
Shakespeare,"Into the chantry by: there, before him,"
Shakespeare,"And underneath that consecrated roof,"
Shakespeare,"Plight me the full assurance of your faith,"
Shakespeare,That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
Shakespeare,May live at peace. He shall conceal it
Shakespeare,"Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,"
Shakespeare,What time we will our celebration keep
Shakespeare,According to my birth. What do you say?
Shakespeare,"I'll follow this good man, and go with you,"
Shakespeare,"And, having sworn truth, ever will be true."
Shakespeare,"Then lead the way, good father, and heavens so shine,"
Shakespeare,That they may fairly note this act of mine!
Shakespeare,Enter Clown and FABIAN
Shakespeare,"Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter."
Shakespeare,"Good Master Fabian, grant me another request."
Shakespeare,Do not desire to see this letter.
Shakespeare,"This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire my"
Shakespeare,dog again.
Shakespeare,"Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and Lords"
Shakespeare,"Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings."
Shakespeare,"I know thee well, how dost thou, my good fellow?"
Shakespeare,"Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse"
Shakespeare,for my friends.
Shakespeare,"Just the contrary, the better for thy friends."
Shakespeare,"No, sir, the worse."
Shakespeare,"Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me,"
Shakespeare,now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by
Shakespeare,"my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,"
Shakespeare,"and by my friends, I am abused: so that,"
Shakespeare,"conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives"
Shakespeare,"make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for"
Shakespeare,my friends and the better for my foes.
Shakespeare,"Why, this is excellent."
Shakespeare,"By my troth, sir, no, though it please you to be"
Shakespeare,one of my friends.
Shakespeare,Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.
Shakespeare,"But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would"
Shakespeare,you could make it another.
Shakespeare,"O, you give me ill counsel."
Shakespeare,"Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,"
Shakespeare,and let your flesh and blood obey it.
Shakespeare,"Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a"
Shakespeare,double-dealer: there's another.
Shakespeare,"Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play, and the old"
Shakespeare,"saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,"
Shakespeare,"sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of"
Shakespeare,"Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind, one, two, three."
Shakespeare,You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:
Shakespeare,if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
Shakespeare,"with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake"
Shakespeare,my bounty further.
Shakespeare,"Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come"
Shakespeare,"again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think"
Shakespeare,that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:
Shakespeare,"but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I"
Shakespeare,will awake it anon.
Shakespeare,"Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me."
Shakespeare,Enter ANTONIO and Officers
Shakespeare,"That face of his I do remember well,"
Shakespeare,"Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd"
Shakespeare,As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
Shakespeare,"A bawbling vessel was he captain of,"
Shakespeare,"For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,"
Shakespeare,With which such scathful grapple did he make
Shakespeare,"With the most noble bottom of our fleet,"
Shakespeare,That very envy and the tongue of loss
Shakespeare,Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
Shakespeare,"Orsino, this is that Antonio"
Shakespeare,"That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy,"
Shakespeare,"And this is he that did the Tiger board,"
Shakespeare,When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
Shakespeare,"Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,"
Shakespeare,In private brabble did we apprehend him.
Shakespeare,"He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,"
Shakespeare,But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
Shakespeare,I know not what 'twas but distraction.
Shakespeare,Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
Shakespeare,"What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,"
Shakespeare,"Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,"
Shakespeare,Hast made thine enemies?
Shakespeare,"Orsino, noble sir,"
Shakespeare,Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
Shakespeare,"Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,"
Shakespeare,"Though I confess, on base and ground enough,"
Shakespeare,Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
Shakespeare,"That most ingrateful boy there by your side,"
Shakespeare,From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
Shakespeare,"Did I redeem, a wreck past hope he was:"
Shakespeare,His life I gave him and did thereto add
Shakespeare,"My love, without retention or restraint,"
Shakespeare,"All his in dedication, for his sake"
Shakespeare,"Did I expose myself, pure for his love,"
Shakespeare,"Into the danger of this adverse town,"
Shakespeare,Drew to defend him when he was beset:
Shakespeare,"Where being apprehended, his false cunning,"
Shakespeare,"Not meaning to partake with me in danger,"
Shakespeare,"Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,"
Shakespeare,And grew a twenty years removed thing
Shakespeare,"While one would wink, denied me mine own purse,"
Shakespeare,Which I had recommended to his use
Shakespeare,Not half an hour before.
Shakespeare,How can this be?
Shakespeare,When came he to this town?
Shakespeare,"To-day, my lord, and for three months before,"
Shakespeare,"No interim, not a minute's vacancy,"
Shakespeare,Both day and night did we keep company.
Shakespeare,Enter OLIVIA and Attendants
Shakespeare,Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.
Shakespeare,"But for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness:"
Shakespeare,"Three months this youth hath tended upon me,"
Shakespeare,But more of that anon. Take him aside.
Shakespeare,"What would my lord, but that he may not have,"
Shakespeare,Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
Shakespeare,"Cesario, you do not keep promise with me."
Shakespeare,"Gracious Olivia,--"
Shakespeare,"What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--"
Shakespeare,"My lord would speak, my duty hushes me."
Shakespeare,"If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,"
Shakespeare,It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
Shakespeare,As howling after music.
Shakespeare,Still so cruel?
Shakespeare,"Still so constant, lord."
Shakespeare,"What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,"
Shakespeare,To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
Shakespeare,My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
Shakespeare,That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
Shakespeare,"Even what it please my lord, that shall become him."
Shakespeare,"Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,"
Shakespeare,"Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,"
Shakespeare,Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
Shakespeare,That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
Shakespeare,"Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,"
Shakespeare,And that I partly know the instrument
Shakespeare,"That screws me from my true place in your favour,"
Shakespeare,"Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still,"
Shakespeare,"But this your minion, whom I know you love,"
Shakespeare,"And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,"
Shakespeare,"Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,"
Shakespeare,Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
Shakespeare,"Come, boy, with me, my thoughts are ripe in mischief:"
Shakespeare,"I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,"
Shakespeare,To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
Shakespeare,"And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,"
Shakespeare,"To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die."
Shakespeare,Where goes Cesario?
Shakespeare,After him I love
Shakespeare,"More than I love these eyes, more than my life,"
Shakespeare,"More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife."
Shakespeare,"If I do feign, you witnesses above"
Shakespeare,Punish my life for tainting of my love!
Shakespeare,"Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!"
Shakespeare,Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?
Shakespeare,Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
Shakespeare,Call forth the holy father.
Shakespeare,"Come, away!"
Shakespeare,"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay."
Shakespeare,Husband!
Shakespeare,"Ay, husband: can he that deny?"
Shakespeare,"Her husband, sirrah!"
Shakespeare,"No, my lord, not I."
Shakespeare,"Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear"
Shakespeare,That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
Shakespeare,"Fear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up,"
Shakespeare,"Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art"
Shakespeare,As great as that thou fear'st.
Shakespeare,Enter Priest
Shakespeare,"O, welcome, father!"
Shakespeare,"Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,"
Shakespeare,"Here to unfold, though lately we intended"
Shakespeare,To keep in darkness what occasion now
Shakespeare,"Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know"
Shakespeare,Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.
Shakespeare,"A contract of eternal bond of love,"
Shakespeare,"Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,"
Shakespeare,"Attested by the holy close of lips,"
Shakespeare,"Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings,"
Shakespeare,And all the ceremony of this compact
Shakespeare,"Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:"
Shakespeare,"Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave"
Shakespeare,I have travell'd but two hours.
Shakespeare,O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be
Shakespeare,When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
Shakespeare,"Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,"
Shakespeare,That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
Shakespeare,"Farewell, and take her, but direct thy feet"
Shakespeare,Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
Shakespeare,"My lord, I do protest--"
Shakespeare,"O, do not swear!"
Shakespeare,"Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear."
Shakespeare,"For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently"
Shakespeare,to Sir Toby.
Shakespeare,He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
Shakespeare,"a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your"
Shakespeare,help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
Shakespeare,"Who has done this, Sir Andrew?"
Shakespeare,"The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for"
Shakespeare,"a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate."
Shakespeare,"My gentleman, Cesario?"
Shakespeare,"'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for"
Shakespeare,"nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to do't"
Shakespeare,by Sir Toby.
Shakespeare,Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
Shakespeare,"You drew your sword upon me without cause,"
Shakespeare,"But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not."
Shakespeare,"If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I"
Shakespeare,think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
Shakespeare,Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown
Shakespeare,"Here comes Sir Toby halting, you shall hear more:"
Shakespeare,"but if he had not been in drink, he would have"
Shakespeare,tickled you othergates than he did.
Shakespeare,"How now, gentleman! how is't with you?"
Shakespeare,"That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end"
Shakespeare,"on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?"
Shakespeare,"O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone, his eyes"
Shakespeare,were set at eight i' the morning.
Shakespeare,"Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I"
Shakespeare,hate a drunken rogue.
Shakespeare,Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
Shakespeare,"I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together."
Shakespeare,Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a
Shakespeare,"knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!"
Shakespeare,"Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to."
Shakespeare,"Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW"
Shakespeare,"I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:"
Shakespeare,"But, had it been the brother of my blood,"
Shakespeare,I must have done no less with wit and safety.
Shakespeare,"You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that"
Shakespeare,I do perceive it hath offended you:
Shakespeare,"Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows"
Shakespeare,We made each other but so late ago.
Shakespeare,"One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,"
Shakespeare,"A natural perspective, that is and is not!"
Shakespeare,"Antonio, O my dear Antonio!"
Shakespeare,"How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,"
Shakespeare,Since I have lost thee!
Shakespeare,Sebastian are you?
Shakespeare,"Fear'st thou that, Antonio?"
Shakespeare,How have you made division of yourself?
Shakespeare,"An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin"
Shakespeare,Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
Shakespeare,Most wonderful!
Shakespeare,"Do I stand there? I never had a brother,"
Shakespeare,"Nor can there be that deity in my nature,"
Shakespeare,"Of here and every where. I had a sister,"
Shakespeare,Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
Shakespeare,"Of charity, what kin are you to me?"
Shakespeare,What countryman? what name? what parentage?
Shakespeare,"Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father,"
Shakespeare,"Such a Sebastian was my brother too,"
Shakespeare,So went he suited to his watery tomb:
Shakespeare,If spirits can assume both form and suit
Shakespeare,You come to fright us.
Shakespeare,"A spirit I am indeed,"
Shakespeare,But am in that dimension grossly clad
Shakespeare,Which from the womb I did participate.
Shakespeare,"Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,"
Shakespeare,"I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,"
Shakespeare,"And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'"
Shakespeare,My father had a mole upon his brow.
Shakespeare,And so had mine.
Shakespeare,And died that day when Viola from her birth
Shakespeare,Had number'd thirteen years.
Shakespeare,"O, that record is lively in my soul!"
Shakespeare,He finished indeed his mortal act
Shakespeare,That day that made my sister thirteen years.
Shakespeare,If nothing lets to make us happy both
Shakespeare,"But this my masculine usurp'd attire,"
Shakespeare,Do not embrace me till each circumstance
Shakespeare,"Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump"
Shakespeare,"That I am Viola: which to confirm,"
Shakespeare,"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,"
Shakespeare,"Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help"
Shakespeare,I was preserved to serve this noble count.
Shakespeare,All the occurrence of my fortune since
Shakespeare,Hath been between this lady and this lord.
Shakespeare,"[To OLIVIA]  So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:"
Shakespeare,But nature to her bias drew in that.
Shakespeare,"You would have been contracted to a maid,"
Shakespeare,"Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,"
Shakespeare,You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
Shakespeare,"Be not amazed, right noble is his blood."
Shakespeare,"If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,"
Shakespeare,I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
Shakespeare,"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times"
Shakespeare,Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
Shakespeare,"And all those sayings will I overswear,"
Shakespeare,And those swearings keep as true in soul
Shakespeare,As doth that orbed continent the fire
Shakespeare,That severs day from night.
Shakespeare,And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
Shakespeare,The captain that did bring me first on shore
Shakespeare,Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
Shakespeare,"Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,"
Shakespeare,"A gentleman, and follower of my lady's."
Shakespeare,He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
Shakespeare,"And yet, alas, now I remember me,"
Shakespeare,"They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract."
Shakespeare,"Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN"
Shakespeare,A most extracting frenzy of mine own
Shakespeare,From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
Shakespeare,"How does he, sirrah?"
Shakespeare,"Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as"
Shakespeare,well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
Shakespeare,"letter to you, I should have given't you to-day"
Shakespeare,"morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,"
Shakespeare,so it skills not much when they are delivered.
Shakespeare,"Open't, and read it."
Shakespeare,Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
Shakespeare,the madman.
Shakespeare,"'By the Lord, madam,'--"
Shakespeare,How now! art thou mad?
Shakespeare,"No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship"
Shakespeare,"will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox."
Shakespeare,"Prithee, read i' thy right wits."
Shakespeare,"So I do, madonna, but to read his right wits is to"
Shakespeare,"read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear."
Shakespeare,"Read it you, sirrah."
Shakespeare,"[Reads]  'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the"
Shakespeare,world shall know it: though you have put me into
Shakespeare,darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
Shakespeare,"me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as"
Shakespeare,your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
Shakespeare,"me to the semblance I put on, with the which I doubt"
Shakespeare,"not but to do myself much right, or you much shame."
Shakespeare,Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
Shakespeare,unthought of and speak out of my injury.
Shakespeare,THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'
Shakespeare,Did he write this?
Shakespeare,This savours not much of distraction.
Shakespeare,"See him deliver'd, Fabian, bring him hither."
Shakespeare,Exit FABIAN
Shakespeare,"My lord so please you, these things further"
Shakespeare,"thought on,"
Shakespeare,"To think me as well a sister as a wife,"
Shakespeare,"One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,"
Shakespeare,Here at my house and at my proper cost.
Shakespeare,"Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer."
Shakespeare,"Your master quits you, and for your service done him,"
Shakespeare,"So much against the mettle of your sex,"
Shakespeare,"So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,"
Shakespeare,"And since you call'd me master for so long,"
Shakespeare,Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
Shakespeare,Your master's mistress.
Shakespeare,A sister! you are she.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO"
Shakespeare,Is this the madman?
Shakespeare,"Ay, my lord, this same."
Shakespeare,"Madam, you have done me wrong,"
Shakespeare,Notorious wrong.
Shakespeare,"Have I, Malvolio? no."
Shakespeare,"Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter."
Shakespeare,You must not now deny it is your hand:
Shakespeare,"Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase,"
Shakespeare,"Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:"
Shakespeare,"You can say none of this: well, grant it then"
Shakespeare,"And tell me, in the modesty of honour,"
Shakespeare,"Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,"
Shakespeare,"Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,"
Shakespeare,To put on yellow stockings and to frown
Shakespeare,"Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people,"
Shakespeare,"And, acting this in an obedient hope,"
Shakespeare,"Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,"
Shakespeare,"Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,"
Shakespeare,And made the most notorious geck and gull
Shakespeare,That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
Shakespeare,"Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,"
Shakespeare,"Though, I confess, much like the character"
Shakespeare,But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
Shakespeare,"And now I do bethink me, it was she"
Shakespeare,"First told me thou wast mad, then camest in smiling,"
Shakespeare,And in such forms which here were presupposed
Shakespeare,"Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:"
Shakespeare,"This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee,"
Shakespeare,"But when we know the grounds and authors of it,"
Shakespeare,Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
Shakespeare,Of thine own cause.
Shakespeare,"Good madam, hear me speak,"
Shakespeare,And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
Shakespeare,"Taint the condition of this present hour,"
Shakespeare,"Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,"
Shakespeare,"Most freely I confess, myself and Toby"
Shakespeare,"Set this device against Malvolio here,"
Shakespeare,Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
Shakespeare,We had conceived against him: Maria writ
Shakespeare,"The letter at Sir Toby's great importance,"
Shakespeare,In recompense whereof he hath married her.
Shakespeare,"How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,"
Shakespeare,"May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,"
Shakespeare,If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
Shakespeare,That have on both sides pass'd.
Shakespeare,"Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!"
Shakespeare,"Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,"
Shakespeare,and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
Shakespeare,"one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir, but"
Shakespeare,"that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'"
Shakespeare,"But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such"
Shakespeare,"a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'"
Shakespeare,and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
Shakespeare,I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
Shakespeare,He hath been most notoriously abused.
Shakespeare,Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
Shakespeare,He hath not told us of the captain yet:
Shakespeare,"When that is known and golden time convents,"
Shakespeare,A solemn combination shall be made
Shakespeare,"Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,"
Shakespeare,"We will not part from hence. Cesario, come,"
Shakespeare,"For so you shall be, while you are a man,"
Shakespeare,"But when in other habits you are seen,"
Shakespeare,Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt all, except Clown"
Shakespeare,"When that I was and a little tiny boy,"
Shakespeare,"With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,"
Shakespeare,"A foolish thing was but a toy,"
Shakespeare,"But when I came to man's estate,"
Shakespeare,"With hey, ho,  and c."
Shakespeare,"With hey, ho,  and c."
Shakespeare,"With hey, ho,  and c."
Shakespeare,"With hey, ho,  and c."
Shakespeare,"'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,"
Shakespeare,"For the rain,  and c."
Shakespeare,"For the rain,  and c."
Shakespeare,"For the rain,  and c."
Shakespeare,"But when I came, alas! to wive,"
Shakespeare,"By swaggering could I never thrive,"
Shakespeare,"But when I came unto my beds,"
Shakespeare,"With toss-pots still had drunken heads,"
Shakespeare,"A great while ago the world begun,"
Shakespeare,"But that's all one, our play is done,"
Shakespeare,And we'll strive to please you every day.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Verona. An open place.
Shakespeare,Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS
Shakespeare,"Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:"
Shakespeare,Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
Shakespeare,Were't not affection chains thy tender days
Shakespeare,"To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,"
Shakespeare,I rather would entreat thy company
Shakespeare,"To see the wonders of the world abroad,"
Shakespeare,"Than, living dully sluggardized at home,"
Shakespeare,Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
Shakespeare,"But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,"
Shakespeare,Even as I would when I to love begin.
Shakespeare,"Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!"
Shakespeare,"Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest"
Shakespeare,Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
Shakespeare,Wish me partaker in thy happiness
Shakespeare,"When thou dost meet good hap, and in thy danger,"
Shakespeare,"If ever danger do environ thee,"
Shakespeare,"Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,"
Shakespeare,"For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine."
Shakespeare,And on a love-book pray for my success?
Shakespeare,Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
Shakespeare,That's on some shallow story of deep love:
Shakespeare,How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
Shakespeare,That's a deep story of a deeper love:
Shakespeare,For he was more than over shoes in love.
Shakespeare,"'Tis true, for you are over boots in love,"
Shakespeare,And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
Shakespeare,"Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots."
Shakespeare,"No, I will not, for it boots thee not."
Shakespeare,"To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans,"
Shakespeare,"Coy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading moment's mirth"
Shakespeare,"With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:"
Shakespeare,"If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain,"
Shakespeare,"If lost, why then a grievous labour won,"
Shakespeare,"However, but a folly bought with wit,"
Shakespeare,Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
Shakespeare,"So, by your circumstance, you call me fool."
Shakespeare,"So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove."
Shakespeare,'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.
Shakespeare,"Love is your master, for he masters you:"
Shakespeare,"And he that is so yoked by a fool,"
Shakespeare,"Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise."
Shakespeare,"Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud"
Shakespeare,"The eating canker dwells, so eating love"
Shakespeare,Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
Shakespeare,"And writers say, as the most forward bud"
Shakespeare,"Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,"
Shakespeare,Even so by love the young and tender wit
Shakespeare,"Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,"
Shakespeare,Losing his verdure even in the prime
Shakespeare,And all the fair effects of future hopes.
Shakespeare,"But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,"
Shakespeare,That art a votary to fond desire?
Shakespeare,Once more adieu! my father at the road
Shakespeare,"Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd."
Shakespeare,"And thither will I bring thee, Valentine."
Shakespeare,"Sweet Proteus, no, now let us take our leave."
Shakespeare,To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
Shakespeare,"Of thy success in love, and what news else"
Shakespeare,"Betideth here in absence of thy friend,"
Shakespeare,And likewise will visit thee with mine.
Shakespeare,All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
Shakespeare,"As much to you at home! and so, farewell."
Shakespeare,"He after honour hunts, I after love:"
Shakespeare,"He leaves his friends to dignify them more,"
Shakespeare,"I leave myself, my friends and all, for love."
Shakespeare,"Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,"
Shakespeare,"Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,"
Shakespeare,"War with good counsel, set the world at nought,"
Shakespeare,"Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought."
Shakespeare,Enter SPEED
Shakespeare,Enter SPEED
Shakespeare,"Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?"
Shakespeare,"But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan."
Shakespeare,"Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,"
Shakespeare,And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.
Shakespeare,"Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,"
Shakespeare,An if the shepherd be a while away.
Shakespeare,"You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,"
Shakespeare,and I a sheep?
Shakespeare,"Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep."
Shakespeare,A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.
Shakespeare,This proves me still a sheep.
Shakespeare,"True, and thy master a shepherd."
Shakespeare,"Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance."
Shakespeare,It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
Shakespeare,"The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the"
Shakespeare,"shepherd, but I seek my master, and my master seeks"
Shakespeare,not me: therefore I am no sheep.
Shakespeare,"The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the"
Shakespeare,shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
Shakespeare,"wages followest thy master, thy master for wages"
Shakespeare,follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
Shakespeare,Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
Shakespeare,"But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?"
Shakespeare,"Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,"
Shakespeare,"a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a"
Shakespeare,"lost mutton, nothing for my labour."
Shakespeare,Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
Shakespeare,"If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her."
Shakespeare,"Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you."
Shakespeare,"Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for"
Shakespeare,carrying your letter.
Shakespeare,"You mistake, I mean the pound,--a pinfold."
Shakespeare,"From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,"
Shakespeare,'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
Shakespeare,your lover.
Shakespeare,But what said she?
Shakespeare,[First nodding]  Ay.
Shakespeare,"Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy."
Shakespeare,"You mistook, sir, I say, she did nod: and you ask"
Shakespeare,"me if she did nod, and I say, 'Ay.'"
Shakespeare,And that set together is noddy.
Shakespeare,"Now you have taken the pains to set it together,"
Shakespeare,take it for your pains.
Shakespeare,"No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter."
Shakespeare,"Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you."
Shakespeare,"Why sir, how do you bear with me?"
Shakespeare,"Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing"
Shakespeare,but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
Shakespeare,"Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit."
Shakespeare,And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
Shakespeare,"Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?"
Shakespeare,"Open your purse, that the money and the matter may"
Shakespeare,be both at once delivered.
Shakespeare,"Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?"
Shakespeare,"Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her."
Shakespeare,"Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?"
Shakespeare,"Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her, no,"
Shakespeare,not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
Shakespeare,"and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I"
Shakespeare,fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
Shakespeare,"mind. Give her no token but stones, for she's as"
Shakespeare,hard as steel.
Shakespeare,What said she? nothing?
Shakespeare,"No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To"
Shakespeare,"testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned"
Shakespeare,"me, in requital whereof, henceforth carry your"
Shakespeare,"letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master."
Shakespeare,"Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,"
Shakespeare,"Which cannot perish having thee aboard,"
Shakespeare,Being destined to a drier death on shore.
Shakespeare,Exit SPEED
Shakespeare,I must go send some better messenger:
Shakespeare,"I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,"
Shakespeare,Receiving them from such a worthless post.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. The same. Garden of JULIA's house.
Shakespeare,Enter JULlA and LUCETTA
Shakespeare,"But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,"
Shakespeare,Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
Shakespeare,"Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully."
Shakespeare,Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
Shakespeare,"That every day with parle encounter me,"
Shakespeare,In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
Shakespeare,"Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind"
Shakespeare,According to my shallow simple skill.
Shakespeare,What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
Shakespeare,"As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine,"
Shakespeare,"But, were I you, he never should be mine."
Shakespeare,What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
Shakespeare,"Well of his wealth, but of himself, so so."
Shakespeare,What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
Shakespeare,"Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!"
Shakespeare,How now! what means this passion at his name?
Shakespeare,"Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame"
Shakespeare,"That I, unworthy body as I am,"
Shakespeare,Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
Shakespeare,"Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?"
Shakespeare,Then thus: of many good I think him best.
Shakespeare,"I have no other, but a woman's reason,"
Shakespeare,I think him so because I think him so.
Shakespeare,And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
Shakespeare,"Ay, if you thought your love not cast away."
Shakespeare,"Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me."
Shakespeare,"Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye."
Shakespeare,His little speaking shows his love but small.
Shakespeare,Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
Shakespeare,They do not love that do not show their love.
Shakespeare,"O, they love least that let men know their love."
Shakespeare,I would I knew his mind.
Shakespeare,"Peruse this paper, madam."
Shakespeare,"'To Julia.' Say, from whom?"
Shakespeare,That the contents will show.
Shakespeare,"Say, say, who gave it thee?"
Shakespeare,"Valentine's page, and sent, I think, from Proteus."
Shakespeare,"He would have given it you, but I, being in the way,"
Shakespeare,Did in your name receive it: pardon the
Shakespeare,fault I pray.
Shakespeare,"Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!"
Shakespeare,Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
Shakespeare,To whisper and conspire against my youth?
Shakespeare,"Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth"
Shakespeare,And you an officer fit for the place.
Shakespeare,Or else return no more into my sight.
Shakespeare,To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
Shakespeare,Will ye be gone?
Shakespeare,That you may ruminate.
Shakespeare,And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:
Shakespeare,It were a shame to call her back again
Shakespeare,And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
Shakespeare,"What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,"
Shakespeare,And would not force the letter to my view!
Shakespeare,"Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that"
Shakespeare,Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
Shakespeare,"Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love"
Shakespeare,"That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse"
Shakespeare,And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
Shakespeare,"How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,"
Shakespeare,When willingly I would have had her here!
Shakespeare,"How angerly I taught my brow to frown,"
Shakespeare,When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
Shakespeare,My penance is to call Lucetta back
Shakespeare,And ask remission for my folly past.
Shakespeare,What ho! Lucetta!
Shakespeare,Re-enter LUCETTA
Shakespeare,Re-enter LUCETTA
Shakespeare,What would your ladyship?
Shakespeare,Is't near dinner-time?
Shakespeare,"I would it were,"
Shakespeare,That you might kill your stomach on your meat
Shakespeare,And not upon your maid.
Shakespeare,What is't that you took up so gingerly?
Shakespeare,"Why didst thou stoop, then?"
Shakespeare,To take a paper up that I let fall.
Shakespeare,And is that paper nothing?
Shakespeare,Nothing concerning me.
Shakespeare,Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
Shakespeare,"Madam, it will not lie where it concerns"
Shakespeare,Unless it have a false interpeter.
Shakespeare,Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
Shakespeare,"That I might sing it, madam, to a tune."
Shakespeare,Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
Shakespeare,As little by such toys as may be possible.
Shakespeare,Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'
Shakespeare,It is too heavy for so light a tune.
Shakespeare,Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
Shakespeare,"Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it."
Shakespeare,And why not you?
Shakespeare,I cannot reach so high.
Shakespeare,"Let's see your song. How now, minion!"
Shakespeare,"Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:"
Shakespeare,And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
Shakespeare,You do not?
Shakespeare,"No, madam, it is too sharp."
Shakespeare,"You, minion, are too saucy."
Shakespeare,"Nay, now you are too flat"
Shakespeare,And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
Shakespeare,There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
Shakespeare,The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
Shakespeare,"Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus."
Shakespeare,This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
Shakespeare,Here is a coil with protestation!
Shakespeare,Tears the letter
Shakespeare,"Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:"
Shakespeare,"You would be fingering them, to anger me."
Shakespeare,"She makes it strange, but she would be best pleased"
Shakespeare,To be so anger'd with another letter.
Shakespeare,"Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!"
Shakespeare,"O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!"
Shakespeare,"Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey"
Shakespeare,And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
Shakespeare,I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
Shakespeare,"Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!"
Shakespeare,"As in revenge of thy ingratitude,"
Shakespeare,"I throw thy name against the bruising stones,"
Shakespeare,Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
Shakespeare,And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
Shakespeare,Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
Shakespeare,"Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd,"
Shakespeare,And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
Shakespeare,But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
Shakespeare,"Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away"
Shakespeare,"Till I have found each letter in the letter,"
Shakespeare,Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
Shakespeare,Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
Shakespeare,And throw it thence into the raging sea!
Shakespeare,"Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,"
Shakespeare,"'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,"
Shakespeare,To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
Shakespeare,"And yet I will not, sith so prettily"
Shakespeare,He couples it to his complaining names.
Shakespeare,Thus will I fold them one on another:
Shakespeare,"Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will."
Shakespeare,"Dinner is ready, and your father stays."
Shakespeare,"Well, let us go."
Shakespeare,"What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?"
Shakespeare,"If you respect them, best to take them up."
Shakespeare,"Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:"
Shakespeare,"Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold."
Shakespeare,I see you have a month's mind to them.
Shakespeare,"Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see,"
Shakespeare,"I see things too, although you judge I wink."
Shakespeare,"Come, come, will't please you go?"
Shakespeare,SCENE III. The same. ANTONIO's house.
Shakespeare,Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO
Shakespeare,"Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that"
Shakespeare,Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
Shakespeare,"'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son."
Shakespeare,"Why, what of him?"
Shakespeare,He wonder'd that your lordship
Shakespeare,"Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,"
Shakespeare,"While other men, of slender reputation,"
Shakespeare,Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
Shakespeare,"Some to the wars, to try their fortune there,"
Shakespeare,"Some to discover islands far away,"
Shakespeare,Some to the studious universities.
Shakespeare,"For any or for all these exercises,"
Shakespeare,"He said that Proteus your son was meet,"
Shakespeare,And did request me to importune you
Shakespeare,"To let him spend his time no more at home,"
Shakespeare,"Which would be great impeachment to his age,"
Shakespeare,In having known no travel in his youth.
Shakespeare,Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
Shakespeare,Whereon this month I have been hammering.
Shakespeare,I have consider'd well his loss of time
Shakespeare,"And how he cannot be a perfect man,"
Shakespeare,Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
Shakespeare,Experience is by industry achieved
Shakespeare,And perfected by the swift course of time.
Shakespeare,"Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?"
Shakespeare,I think your lordship is not ignorant
Shakespeare,"How his companion, youthful Valentine,"
Shakespeare,Attends the emperor in his royal court.
Shakespeare,I know it well.
Shakespeare,"'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:"
Shakespeare,"There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,"
Shakespeare,"Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen."
Shakespeare,And be in eye of every exercise
Shakespeare,Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
Shakespeare,"I like thy counsel, well hast thou advised:"
Shakespeare,"And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,"
Shakespeare,The execution of it shall make known.
Shakespeare,Even with the speediest expedition
Shakespeare,I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.
Shakespeare,"To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,"
Shakespeare,"With other gentlemen of good esteem,"
Shakespeare,Are journeying to salute the emperor
Shakespeare,And to commend their service to his will.
Shakespeare,"Good company, with them shall Proteus go:"
Shakespeare,"And, in good time! now will we break with him."
Shakespeare,Enter PROTEUS
Shakespeare,Enter PROTEUS
Shakespeare,Enter PROTEUS
Shakespeare,Enter PROTEUS
Shakespeare,Enter PROTEUS
Shakespeare,Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
Shakespeare,"Here is her hand, the agent of her heart,"
Shakespeare,"Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn."
Shakespeare,"O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,"
Shakespeare,To seal our happiness with their consents!
Shakespeare,O heavenly Julia!
Shakespeare,How now! what letter are you reading there?
Shakespeare,"May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two"
Shakespeare,"Of commendations sent from Valentine,"
Shakespeare,Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.
Shakespeare,"Lend me the letter, let me see what news."
Shakespeare,"There is no news, my lord, but that he writes"
Shakespeare,"How happily he lives, how well beloved"
Shakespeare,"And daily graced by the emperor,"
Shakespeare,"Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune."
Shakespeare,And how stand you affected to his wish?
Shakespeare,As one relying on your lordship's will
Shakespeare,And not depending on his friendly wish.
Shakespeare,My will is something sorted with his wish.
Shakespeare,"Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed,"
Shakespeare,"For what I will, I will, and there an end."
Shakespeare,I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
Shakespeare,With Valentinus in the emperor's court:
Shakespeare,"What maintenance he from his friends receives,"
Shakespeare,Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
Shakespeare,To-morrow be in readiness to go:
Shakespeare,"Excuse it not, for I am peremptory."
Shakespeare,"My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:"
Shakespeare,"Please you, deliberate a day or two."
Shakespeare,"Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:"
Shakespeare,No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
Shakespeare,"Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd"
Shakespeare,To hasten on his expedition.
Shakespeare,Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO
Shakespeare,"Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,"
Shakespeare,"And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd."
Shakespeare,"I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,"
Shakespeare,"Lest he should take exceptions to my love,"
Shakespeare,And with the vantage of mine own excuse
Shakespeare,Hath he excepted most against my love.
Shakespeare,"O, how this spring of love resembleth"
Shakespeare,"The uncertain glory of an April day,"
Shakespeare,"Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,"
Shakespeare,And by and by a cloud takes all away!
Shakespeare,Re-enter PANTHINO
Shakespeare,"Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:"
Shakespeare,"He is in haste, therefore, I pray you to go."
Shakespeare,"Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,"
Shakespeare,And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'

Shakespeare,Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
Shakespeare,"Sir, your glove."
Shakespeare,"Not mine, my gloves are on."
Shakespeare,"Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one."
Shakespeare,"Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:"
Shakespeare,Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
Shakespeare,"Ah, Silvia, Silvia!"
Shakespeare,Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
Shakespeare,"How now, sirrah?"
Shakespeare,"She is not within hearing, sir."
Shakespeare,"Why, sir, who bade you call her?"
Shakespeare,"Your worship, sir, or else I mistook."
Shakespeare,"Well, you'll still be too forward."
Shakespeare,And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
Shakespeare,"Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?"
Shakespeare,She that your worship loves?
Shakespeare,"Why, how know you that I am in love?"
Shakespeare,"Marry, by these special marks: first, you have"
Shakespeare,"learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,"
Shakespeare,"like a malecontent, to relish a love-song, like a"
Shakespeare,"robin-redbreast, to walk alone, like one that had"
Shakespeare,"the pestilence, to sigh, like a school-boy that had"
Shakespeare,"lost his A B C, to weep, like a young wench that had"
Shakespeare,"buried her grandam, to fast, like one that takes"
Shakespeare,"diet, to watch like one that fears robbing, to"
Shakespeare,"speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were"
Shakespeare,"wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock, when you"
Shakespeare,"walked, to walk like one of the lions, when you"
Shakespeare,"fasted, it was presently after dinner, when you"
Shakespeare,"looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you"
Shakespeare,"are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look"
Shakespeare,"on you, I can hardly think you my master."
Shakespeare,Are all these things perceived in me?
Shakespeare,They are all perceived without ye.
Shakespeare,Without me? they cannot.
Shakespeare,"Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you"
Shakespeare,"were so simple, none else would: but you are so"
Shakespeare,"without these follies, that these follies are within"
Shakespeare,you and shine through you like the water in an
Shakespeare,"urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a"
Shakespeare,physician to comment on your malady.
Shakespeare,"But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?"
Shakespeare,She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
Shakespeare,"Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean."
Shakespeare,"Why, sir, I know her not."
Shakespeare,"Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet"
Shakespeare,knowest her not?
Shakespeare,"Is she not hard-favoured, sir?"
Shakespeare,"Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured."
Shakespeare,"Sir, I know that well enough."
Shakespeare,"That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured."
Shakespeare,"I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite."
Shakespeare,That's because the one is painted and the other out
Shakespeare,of all count.
Shakespeare,How painted? and how out of count?
Shakespeare,"Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no"
Shakespeare,man counts of her beauty.
Shakespeare,How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
Shakespeare,You never saw her since she was deformed.
Shakespeare,How long hath she been deformed?
Shakespeare,Ever since you loved her.
Shakespeare,"I have loved her ever since I saw her, and still I"
Shakespeare,see her beautiful.
Shakespeare,"If you love her, you cannot see her."
Shakespeare,"Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes,"
Shakespeare,or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
Shakespeare,have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
Shakespeare,ungartered!
Shakespeare,What should I see then?
Shakespeare,Your own present folly and her passing deformity:
Shakespeare,"for he, being in love, could not see to garter his"
Shakespeare,"hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose."
Shakespeare,"Belike, boy, then, you are in love, for last"
Shakespeare,morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
Shakespeare,"True, sir, I was in love with my bed: I thank you,"
Shakespeare,"you swinged me for my love, which makes me the"
Shakespeare,bolder to chide you for yours.
Shakespeare,"In conclusion, I stand affected to her."
Shakespeare,"I would you were set, so your affection would cease."
Shakespeare,Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
Shakespeare,one she loves.
Shakespeare,And have you?
Shakespeare,Are they not lamely writ?
Shakespeare,"No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!"
Shakespeare,here she comes.
Shakespeare,[Aside]  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
Shakespeare,Now will he interpret to her.
Shakespeare,Enter SILVIA
Shakespeare,Enter SILVIA
Shakespeare,"Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows."
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners."
Shakespeare,"Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand."
Shakespeare,[Aside]  He should give her interest and she gives it him.
Shakespeare,"As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter"
Shakespeare,"Unto the secret nameless friend of yours,"
Shakespeare,Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
Shakespeare,But for my duty to your ladyship.
Shakespeare,I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.
Shakespeare,"Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off,"
Shakespeare,For being ignorant to whom it goes
Shakespeare,"I writ at random, very doubtfully."
Shakespeare,Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
Shakespeare,"No, madam, so it stead you, I will write"
Shakespeare,"Please you command, a thousand times as much, And yet--"
Shakespeare,"A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel,"
Shakespeare,"And yet I will not name it, and yet I care not,"
Shakespeare,"And yet take this again, and yet I thank you,"
Shakespeare,Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  And yet you will, and yet another 'yet.'"
Shakespeare,What means your ladyship? do you not like it?
Shakespeare,"Yes, yes, the lines are very quaintly writ,"
Shakespeare,"But since unwillingly, take them again."
Shakespeare,"Nay, take them."
Shakespeare,"Madam, they are for you."
Shakespeare,"Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request,"
Shakespeare,"But I will none of them, they are for you,"
Shakespeare,I would have had them writ more movingly.
Shakespeare,"Please you, I'll write your ladyship another."
Shakespeare,"And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,"
Shakespeare,"And if it please you, so, if not, why, so."
Shakespeare,"If it please me, madam, what then?"
Shakespeare,"Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:"
Shakespeare,"And so, good morrow, servant."
Shakespeare,"O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,"
Shakespeare,"As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!"
Shakespeare,"My master sues to her, and she hath"
Shakespeare,"taught her suitor,"
Shakespeare,"He being her pupil, to become her tutor."
Shakespeare,"O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,"
Shakespeare,"That my master, being scribe, to himself should write"
Shakespeare,the letter?
Shakespeare,"How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?"
Shakespeare,"Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason."
Shakespeare,To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.
Shakespeare,"To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure."
Shakespeare,What figure?
Shakespeare,"By a letter, I should say."
Shakespeare,"Why, she hath not writ to me?"
Shakespeare,"What need she, when she hath made you write to"
Shakespeare,"yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?"
Shakespeare,"No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive"
Shakespeare,her earnest?
Shakespeare,"She gave me none, except an angry word."
Shakespeare,"Why, she hath given you a letter."
Shakespeare,That's the letter I writ to her friend.
Shakespeare,"And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end."
Shakespeare,I would it were no worse.
Shakespeare,"I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:"
Shakespeare,"For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,"
Shakespeare,"Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply,"
Shakespeare,"Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,"
Shakespeare,Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
Shakespeare,"All this I speak in print, for in print I found it."
Shakespeare,"Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time."
Shakespeare,I have dined.
Shakespeare,"Ay, but hearken, sir, though the chameleon Love can"
Shakespeare,"feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my"
Shakespeare,"victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like"
Shakespeare,"your mistress, be moved, be moved."

Shakespeare,"Have patience, gentle Julia."
Shakespeare,"I must, where is no remedy."
Shakespeare,"When possibly I can, I will return."
Shakespeare,"If you turn not, you will return the sooner."
Shakespeare,Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
Shakespeare,Giving a ring
Shakespeare,"Why then, we'll make exchange, here, take you this."
Shakespeare,And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
Shakespeare,"Here is my hand for my true constancy,"
Shakespeare,And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
Shakespeare,"Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,"
Shakespeare,The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
Shakespeare,Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
Shakespeare,"My father stays my coming, answer not,"
Shakespeare,"The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears,"
Shakespeare,That tide will stay me longer than I should.
Shakespeare,"Julia, farewell!"
Shakespeare,Exit JULIA
Shakespeare,"What, gone without a word?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak,"
Shakespeare,For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.

Shakespeare,Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.
Shakespeare,"Enter LAUNCE, leading a dog"
Shakespeare,"Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping,"
Shakespeare,all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I
Shakespeare,"have received my proportion, like the prodigious"
Shakespeare,"son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's"
Shakespeare,"court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured"
Shakespeare,"dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father"
Shakespeare,"wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat"
Shakespeare,"wringing her hands, and all our house in a great"
Shakespeare,"perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed"
Shakespeare,"one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and"
Shakespeare,has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have
Shakespeare,"wept to have seen our parting, why, my grandam,"
Shakespeare,"having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my"
Shakespeare,"parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This"
Shakespeare,"shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:"
Shakespeare,"no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that"
Shakespeare,"cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it"
Shakespeare,"hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in"
Shakespeare,"it, is my mother, and this my father, a vengeance"
Shakespeare,"on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my"
Shakespeare,"sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and"
Shakespeare,"as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I"
Shakespeare,"am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the"
Shakespeare,"dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself, ay, so,"
Shakespeare,"so. Now come I to my father, Father, your blessing:"
Shakespeare,now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:
Shakespeare,"now should I kiss my father, well, he weeps on. Now"
Shakespeare,"come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now"
Shakespeare,"like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her, why, there"
Shakespeare,"'tis, here's my mother's breath up and down. Now"
Shakespeare,"come I to my sister, mark the moan she makes. Now"
Shakespeare,the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
Shakespeare,"word, but see how I lay the dust with my tears."
Shakespeare,"Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped"
Shakespeare,and thou art to post after with oars. What's the
Shakespeare,"matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You'll"
Shakespeare,"lose the tide, if you tarry any longer."
Shakespeare,"It is no matter if the tied were lost, for it is the"
Shakespeare,unkindest tied that ever any man tied.
Shakespeare,What's the unkindest tide?
Shakespeare,"Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog."
Shakespeare,"Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in"
Shakespeare,"losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing"
Shakespeare,"thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy"
Shakespeare,"master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy"
Shakespeare,"service,--Why dost thou stop my mouth?"
Shakespeare,For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.
Shakespeare,Where should I lose my tongue?
Shakespeare,In thy tale.
Shakespeare,In thy tail!
Shakespeare,"Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and"
Shakespeare,"the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river"
Shakespeare,"were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears, if the"
Shakespeare,"wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs."
Shakespeare,"Come, come away, man, I was sent to call thee."
Shakespeare,"Sir, call me what thou darest."
Shakespeare,Wilt thou go?
Shakespeare,"Well, I will go."

Shakespeare,"Of my mistress, then."
Shakespeare,'Twere good you knocked him.
Shakespeare,"Servant, you are sad."
Shakespeare,"Indeed, madam, I seem so."
Shakespeare,Seem you that you are not?
Shakespeare,Haply I do.
Shakespeare,So do counterfeits.
Shakespeare,So do you.
Shakespeare,What seem I that I am not?
Shakespeare,Wise.
Shakespeare,What instance of the contrary?
Shakespeare,Your folly.
Shakespeare,And how quote you my folly?
Shakespeare,I quote it in your jerkin.
Shakespeare,My jerkin is a doublet.
Shakespeare,"Well, then, I'll double your folly."
Shakespeare,"What, angry, Sir Thurio! do you change colour?"
Shakespeare,"Give him leave, madam, he is a kind of chameleon."
Shakespeare,That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live
Shakespeare,in your air.
Shakespeare,"You have said, sir."
Shakespeare,"Ay, sir, and done too, for this time."
Shakespeare,"I know it well, sir, you always end ere you begin."
Shakespeare,"A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off."
Shakespeare,"'Tis indeed, madam, we thank the giver."
Shakespeare,"Who is that, servant?"
Shakespeare,"Yourself, sweet lady, for you gave the fire. Sir"
Shakespeare,"Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,"
Shakespeare,and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.
Shakespeare,"Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall"
Shakespeare,make your wit bankrupt.
Shakespeare,"I know it well, sir, you have an exchequer of words,"
Shakespeare,"and, I think, no other treasure to give your"
Shakespeare,"followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,"
Shakespeare,that they live by your bare words.
Shakespeare,"No more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father."

Shakespeare,To any happy messenger from thence.
Shakespeare,"Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman"
Shakespeare,To be of worth and worthy estimation
Shakespeare,And not without desert so well reputed.
Shakespeare,Hath he not a son?
Shakespeare,"Ay, my good lord, a son that well deserves"
Shakespeare,The honour and regard of such a father.
Shakespeare,You know him well?
Shakespeare,"I know him as myself, for from our infancy"
Shakespeare,We have conversed and spent our hours together:
Shakespeare,"And though myself have been an idle truant,"
Shakespeare,Omitting the sweet benefit of time
Shakespeare,"To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,"
Shakespeare,"Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,"
Shakespeare,"Made use and fair advantage of his days,"
Shakespeare,"His years but young, but his experience old,"
Shakespeare,"His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe,"
Shakespeare,"And, in a word, for far behind his worth"
Shakespeare,"Comes all the praises that I now bestow,"
Shakespeare,He is complete in feature and in mind
Shakespeare,With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
Shakespeare,"Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,"
Shakespeare,He is as worthy for an empress' love
Shakespeare,As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
Shakespeare,"Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,"
Shakespeare,"With commendation from great potentates,"
Shakespeare,And here he means to spend his time awhile:
Shakespeare,I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
Shakespeare,"Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he."
Shakespeare,Welcome him then according to his worth.
Shakespeare,"Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio,"
Shakespeare,"For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:"
Shakespeare,I will send him hither to you presently.
Shakespeare,This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
Shakespeare,"Had come along with me, but that his mistress"
Shakespeare,Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
Shakespeare,Belike that now she hath enfranchised them
Shakespeare,Upon some other pawn for fealty.
Shakespeare,"Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still."
Shakespeare,"Nay, then he should be blind, and, being blind"
Shakespeare,How could he see his way to seek out you?
Shakespeare,"Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes."
Shakespeare,They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
Shakespeare,"To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:"
Shakespeare,Upon a homely object Love can wink.
Shakespeare,"Have done, have done, here comes the gentleman."
Shakespeare,Exit THURIO
Shakespeare,Exit THURIO
Shakespeare,"Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,"
Shakespeare,Confirm his welcome with some special favour.
Shakespeare,"His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,"
Shakespeare,If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.
Shakespeare,"Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him"
Shakespeare,To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.
Shakespeare,Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
Shakespeare,"Not so, sweet  lady: but too mean a servant"
Shakespeare,To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
Shakespeare,Leave off discourse of disability:
Shakespeare,"Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant."
Shakespeare,"My duty will I boast of, nothing else."
Shakespeare,And duty never yet did want his meed:
Shakespeare,"Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress."
Shakespeare,I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
Shakespeare,That you are welcome?
Shakespeare,That you are worthless.
Shakespeare,Re-enter THURIO
Shakespeare,"Madam, my lord your father would speak with you."
Shakespeare,"I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,"
Shakespeare,"Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:"
Shakespeare,"I'll leave you to confer of home affairs,"
Shakespeare,"When you have done, we look to hear from you."
Shakespeare,We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
Shakespeare,Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO
Shakespeare,"Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?"
Shakespeare,Your friends are well and have them much commended.
Shakespeare,And how do yours?
Shakespeare,I left them all in health.
Shakespeare,How does your lady? and how thrives your love?
Shakespeare,"My tales of love were wont to weary you,"
Shakespeare,I know you joy not in a love discourse.
Shakespeare,"Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:"
Shakespeare,"I have done penance for contemning Love,"
Shakespeare,Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
Shakespeare,"With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,"
Shakespeare,"With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs,"
Shakespeare,"For in revenge of my contempt of love,"
Shakespeare,Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
Shakespeare,And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
Shakespeare,"O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,"
Shakespeare,"And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,"
Shakespeare,"There is no woe to his correction,"
Shakespeare,Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
Shakespeare,"Now no discourse, except it be of love,"
Shakespeare,"Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,"
Shakespeare,Upon the very naked name of love.
Shakespeare,"Enough, I read your fortune in your eye."
Shakespeare,Was this the idol that you worship so?
Shakespeare,"Even she, and is she not a heavenly saint?"
Shakespeare,"No, but she is an earthly paragon."
Shakespeare,Call her divine.
Shakespeare,I will not flatter her.
Shakespeare,"O, flatter me, for love delights in praises."
Shakespeare,"When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,"
Shakespeare,And I must minister the like to you.
Shakespeare,"Then speak the truth by her, if not divine,"
Shakespeare,"Yet let her be a principality,"
Shakespeare,Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
Shakespeare,Except my mistress.
Shakespeare,"Sweet, except not any,"
Shakespeare,Except thou wilt except against my love.
Shakespeare,Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
Shakespeare,And I will help thee to prefer her too:
Shakespeare,She shall be dignified with this high honour--
Shakespeare,"To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth"
Shakespeare,Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
Shakespeare,"And, of so great a favour growing proud,"
Shakespeare,Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
Shakespeare,And make rough winter everlastingly.
Shakespeare,"Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?"
Shakespeare,"Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing"
Shakespeare,"To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing,"
Shakespeare,She is alone.
Shakespeare,Then let her alone.
Shakespeare,"Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,"
Shakespeare,And I as rich in having such a jewel
Shakespeare,"As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,"
Shakespeare,The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
Shakespeare,"Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,"
Shakespeare,Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
Shakespeare,"My foolish rival, that her father likes"
Shakespeare,"Only for his possessions are so huge,"
Shakespeare,"Is gone with her along, and I must after,"
Shakespeare,"For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy."
Shakespeare,But she loves you?
Shakespeare,"Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,"
Shakespeare,"marriage-hour,"
Shakespeare,"With all the cunning manner of our flight,"
Shakespeare,"Determined of, how I must climb her window,"
Shakespeare,"The ladder made of cords, and all the means"
Shakespeare,Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
Shakespeare,"Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,"
Shakespeare,In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
Shakespeare,"Go on before, I shall inquire you forth:"
Shakespeare,"I must unto the road, to disembark"
Shakespeare,"Some necessaries that I needs must use,"
Shakespeare,And then I'll presently attend you.
Shakespeare,Will you make haste?
Shakespeare,Exit VALENTINE
Shakespeare,"Even as one heat another heat expels,"
Shakespeare,"Or as one nail by strength drives out another,"
Shakespeare,So the remembrance of my former love
Shakespeare,Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
Shakespeare,"Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,"
Shakespeare,"Her true perfection, or my false transgression,"
Shakespeare,That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
Shakespeare,"She is fair, and so is Julia that I love--"
Shakespeare,"That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd,"
Shakespeare,"Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,"
Shakespeare,Bears no impression of the thing it was.
Shakespeare,"Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,"
Shakespeare,And that I love him not as I was wont.
Shakespeare,"O, but I love his lady too too much,"
Shakespeare,And that's the reason I love him so little.
Shakespeare,"How shall I dote on her with more advice,"
Shakespeare,That thus without advice begin to love her!
Shakespeare,"'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,"
Shakespeare,"And that hath dazzled my reason's light,"
Shakespeare,"But when I look on her perfections,"
Shakespeare,There is no reason but I shall be blind.
Shakespeare,"If I can cheque my erring love, I will,"
Shakespeare,"If not, to compass her I'll use my skill."
Shakespeare,SCENE V. The same. A street.
Shakespeare,Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally
Shakespeare,"Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!"
Shakespeare,"Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not"
Shakespeare,"welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never"
Shakespeare,"undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a"
Shakespeare,place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess
Shakespeare,say 'Welcome!'
Shakespeare,"Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you"
Shakespeare,"presently, where, for one shot of five pence, thou"
Shakespeare,"shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how"
Shakespeare,did thy master part with Madam Julia?
Shakespeare,"Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very"
Shakespeare,fairly in jest.
Shakespeare,But shall she marry him?
Shakespeare,How then? shall he marry her?
Shakespeare,"No, neither."
Shakespeare,"What, are they broken?"
Shakespeare,"No, they are both as whole as a fish."
Shakespeare,"Why, then, how stands the matter with them?"
Shakespeare,"Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it"
Shakespeare,stands well with her.
Shakespeare,What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.
Shakespeare,"What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My"
Shakespeare,staff understands me.
Shakespeare,What thou sayest?
Shakespeare,"Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but lean,"
Shakespeare,and my staff understands me.
Shakespeare,"It stands under thee, indeed."
Shakespeare,"Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one."
Shakespeare,"But tell me true, will't be a match?"
Shakespeare,"Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no,"
Shakespeare,"it will, if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will."
Shakespeare,The conclusion is then that it will.
Shakespeare,Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.
Shakespeare,"'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest"
Shakespeare,"thou, that my master is become a notable lover?"
Shakespeare,I never knew him otherwise.
Shakespeare,Than how?
Shakespeare,"A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be."
Shakespeare,"Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me."
Shakespeare,"Why, fool, I meant not thee, I meant thy master."
Shakespeare,"I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover."
Shakespeare,"Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself"
Shakespeare,"in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse,"
Shakespeare,"if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the"
Shakespeare,name of a Christian.
Shakespeare,Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to
Shakespeare,go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?
Shakespeare,At thy service.
Shakespeare,SCENE VI. The same. The DUKE'S palace.
Shakespeare,"To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn,"
Shakespeare,"To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn,"
Shakespeare,"To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn,"
Shakespeare,And even that power which gave me first my oath
Shakespeare,"Provokes me to this threefold perjury,"
Shakespeare,Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
Shakespeare,"O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,"
Shakespeare,"Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!"
Shakespeare,"At first I did adore a twinkling star,"
Shakespeare,But now I worship a celestial sun.
Shakespeare,"Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,"
Shakespeare,And he wants wit that wants resolved will
Shakespeare,To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
Shakespeare,"Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,"
Shakespeare,Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
Shakespeare,With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
Shakespeare,"I cannot leave to love, and yet I do,"
Shakespeare,But there I leave to love where I should love.
Shakespeare,Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
Shakespeare,"If I keep them, I needs must lose myself,"
Shakespeare,"If I lose them, thus find I by their loss"
Shakespeare,"For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia."
Shakespeare,"I to myself am dearer than a friend,"
Shakespeare,"For love is still most precious in itself,"
Shakespeare,"And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--"
Shakespeare,Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
Shakespeare,"I will forget that Julia is alive,"
Shakespeare,"Remembering that my love to her is dead,"
Shakespeare,"And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,"
Shakespeare,Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
Shakespeare,"I cannot now prove constant to myself,"
Shakespeare,Without some treachery used to Valentine.
Shakespeare,This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
Shakespeare,"To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,"
Shakespeare,"Myself in counsel, his competitor."
Shakespeare,Now presently I'll give her father notice
Shakespeare,"Of their disguising and pretended flight,"
Shakespeare,"Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine,"
Shakespeare,"For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter,"
Shakespeare,"But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross"
Shakespeare,By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
Shakespeare,"Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,"
Shakespeare,As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!
Shakespeare,SCENE VII. Verona. JULIA'S house.
Shakespeare,Enter JULIA and LUCETTA
Shakespeare,"Counsel, Lucetta, gentle girl, assist me,"
Shakespeare,"And even in kind love I do conjure thee,"
Shakespeare,Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
Shakespeare,"Are visibly character'd and engraved,"
Shakespeare,To lesson me and tell me some good mean
Shakespeare,"How, with my honour, I may undertake"
Shakespeare,A journey to my loving Proteus.
Shakespeare,"Alas, the way is wearisome and long!"
Shakespeare,A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
Shakespeare,"To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps,"
Shakespeare,"Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,"
Shakespeare,"And when the flight is made to one so dear,"
Shakespeare,"Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus."
Shakespeare,Better forbear till Proteus make return.
Shakespeare,"O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?"
Shakespeare,"Pity the dearth that I have pined in,"
Shakespeare,By longing for that food so long a time.
Shakespeare,"Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,"
Shakespeare,Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
Shakespeare,As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
Shakespeare,"I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,"
Shakespeare,"But qualify the fire's extreme rage,"
Shakespeare,Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
Shakespeare,"The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns."
Shakespeare,"The current that with gentle murmur glides,"
Shakespeare,"Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage,"
Shakespeare,"But when his fair course is not hindered,"
Shakespeare,"He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,"
Shakespeare,Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
Shakespeare,"He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,"
Shakespeare,And so by many winding nooks he strays
Shakespeare,With willing sport to the wild ocean.
Shakespeare,Then let me go and hinder not my course
Shakespeare,I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
Shakespeare,"And make a pastime of each weary step,"
Shakespeare,"Till the last step have brought me to my love,"
Shakespeare,"And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil"
Shakespeare,A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
Shakespeare,But in what habit will you go along?
Shakespeare,"Not like a woman, for I would prevent"
Shakespeare,The loose encounters of lascivious men:
Shakespeare,"Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds"
Shakespeare,As may beseem some well-reputed page.
Shakespeare,"Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair."
Shakespeare,"No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings"
Shakespeare,With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
Shakespeare,To be fantastic may become a youth
Shakespeare,Of greater time than I shall show to be.
Shakespeare,"What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?"
Shakespeare,"That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,"
Shakespeare,What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
Shakespeare,"Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta."
Shakespeare,"You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam."
Shakespeare,"Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd."
Shakespeare,"A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,"
Shakespeare,Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
Shakespeare,"Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have"
Shakespeare,What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
Shakespeare,"But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me"
Shakespeare,For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
Shakespeare,"I fear me, it will make me scandalized."
Shakespeare,"If you think so, then stay at home and go not."
Shakespeare,"Nay, that I will not."
Shakespeare,"Then never dream on infamy, but go."
Shakespeare,"If Proteus like your journey when you come,"
Shakespeare,No matter who's displeased when you are gone:
Shakespeare,"I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal."
Shakespeare,"That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:"
Shakespeare,"A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears"
Shakespeare,And instances of infinite of love
Shakespeare,Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
Shakespeare,All these are servants to deceitful men.
Shakespeare,"Base men, that use them to so base effect!"
Shakespeare,But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth
Shakespeare,"His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,"
Shakespeare,"His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,"
Shakespeare,"His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,"
Shakespeare,His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
Shakespeare,"Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!"
Shakespeare,"Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong"
Shakespeare,To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
Shakespeare,"Only deserve my love by loving him,"
Shakespeare,"And presently go with me to my chamber,"
Shakespeare,"To take a note of what I stand in need of,"
Shakespeare,To furnish me upon my longing journey.
Shakespeare,"All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,"
Shakespeare,"My goods, my lands, my reputation,"
Shakespeare,"Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence."
Shakespeare,"Come, answer not, but to it presently!"
Shakespeare,I am impatient of my tarriance.
Shakespeare,"Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS"
Shakespeare,"Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile,"
Shakespeare,We have some secrets to confer about.
Shakespeare,"Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?"
Shakespeare,"My gracious lord, that which I would discover"
Shakespeare,"The law of friendship bids me to conceal,"
Shakespeare,But when I call to mind your gracious favours
Shakespeare,"Done to me, undeserving as I am,"
Shakespeare,My duty pricks me on to utter that
Shakespeare,Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
Shakespeare,"Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,"
Shakespeare,This night intends to steal away your daughter:
Shakespeare,Myself am one made privy to the plot.
Shakespeare,I know you have determined to bestow her
Shakespeare,"On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,"
Shakespeare,"And should she thus be stol'n away from you,"
Shakespeare,It would be much vexation to your age.
Shakespeare,"Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose"
Shakespeare,To cross my friend in his intended drift
Shakespeare,"Than, by concealing it, heap on your head"
Shakespeare,"A pack of sorrows which would press you down,"
Shakespeare,"Being unprevented, to your timeless grave."
Shakespeare,"Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,"
Shakespeare,"Which to requite, command me while I live."
Shakespeare,"This love of theirs myself have often seen,"
Shakespeare,"Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,"
Shakespeare,And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
Shakespeare,Sir Valentine her company and my court:
Shakespeare,But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
Shakespeare,"And so unworthily disgrace the man,"
Shakespeare,"A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,"
Shakespeare,"I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find"
Shakespeare,That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
Shakespeare,"And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,"
Shakespeare,"Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,"
Shakespeare,"I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,"
Shakespeare,"The key whereof myself have ever kept,"
Shakespeare,And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
Shakespeare,"Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean"
Shakespeare,How he her chamber-window will ascend
Shakespeare,"And with a corded ladder fetch her down,"
Shakespeare,For which the youthful lover now is gone
Shakespeare,"And this way comes he with it presently,"
Shakespeare,"Where, if it please you, you may intercept him."
Shakespeare,"But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly"
Shakespeare,"That my discovery be not aimed at,"
Shakespeare,"For love of you, not hate unto my friend,"
Shakespeare,Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
Shakespeare,"Upon mine honour, he shall never know"
Shakespeare,That I had any light from thee of this.
Shakespeare,"Adieu, my Lord, Sir Valentine is coming."
Shakespeare,"Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?"
Shakespeare,"Please it your grace, there is a messenger"
Shakespeare,"That stays to bear my letters to my friends,"
Shakespeare,And I am going to deliver them.
Shakespeare,Be they of much import?
Shakespeare,The tenor of them doth but signify
Shakespeare,My health and happy being at your court.
Shakespeare,"Nay then, no matter, stay with me awhile,"
Shakespeare,I am to break with thee of some affairs
Shakespeare,"That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret."
Shakespeare,'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
Shakespeare,To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
Shakespeare,"I know it well, my Lord, and, sure, the match"
Shakespeare,"Were rich and honourable, besides, the gentleman"
Shakespeare,"Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities"
Shakespeare,Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:
Shakespeare,Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
Shakespeare,"No, trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward,"
Shakespeare,"Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,"
Shakespeare,Neither regarding that she is my child
Shakespeare,"Nor fearing me as if I were her father,"
Shakespeare,"And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,"
Shakespeare,"Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her,"
Shakespeare,"And, where I thought the remnant of mine age"
Shakespeare,"Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,"
Shakespeare,I now am full resolved to take a wife
Shakespeare,And turn her out to who will take her in:
Shakespeare,"Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower,"
Shakespeare,For me and my possessions she esteems not.
Shakespeare,What would your Grace have me to do in this?
Shakespeare,There is a lady in Verona here
Shakespeare,"Whom I affect, but she is nice and coy"
Shakespeare,And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
Shakespeare,Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
Shakespeare,"For long agone I have forgot to court,"
Shakespeare,"Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--"
Shakespeare,How and which way I may bestow myself
Shakespeare,To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
Shakespeare,"Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:"
Shakespeare,Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
Shakespeare,More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
Shakespeare,But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
Shakespeare,A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
Shakespeare,"Send her another, never give her o'er,"
Shakespeare,For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
Shakespeare,"If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,"
Shakespeare,But rather to beget more love in you:
Shakespeare,"If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone,"
Shakespeare,"For why, the fools are mad, if left alone."
Shakespeare,"Take no repulse, whatever she doth say,"
Shakespeare,"For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'"
Shakespeare,"Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces,"
Shakespeare,"Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces."
Shakespeare,"That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,"
Shakespeare,If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
Shakespeare,But she I mean is promised by her friends
Shakespeare,"Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,"
Shakespeare,"And kept severely from resort of men,"
Shakespeare,That no man hath access by day to her.
Shakespeare,"Why, then, I would resort to her by night."
Shakespeare,"Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,"
Shakespeare,That no man hath recourse to her by night.
Shakespeare,What lets but one may enter at her window?
Shakespeare,"Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,"
Shakespeare,And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
Shakespeare,Without apparent hazard of his life.
Shakespeare,"Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,"
Shakespeare,"To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,"
Shakespeare,"Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,"
Shakespeare,So bold Leander would adventure it.
Shakespeare,"Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,"
Shakespeare,Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
Shakespeare,"When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that."
Shakespeare,"This very night, for Love is like a child,"
Shakespeare,That longs for every thing that he can come by.
Shakespeare,By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
Shakespeare,"But, hark thee, I will go to her alone:"
Shakespeare,How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
Shakespeare,"It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it"
Shakespeare,Under a cloak that is of any length.
Shakespeare,A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
Shakespeare,Then let me see thy cloak:
Shakespeare,I'll get me one of such another length.
Shakespeare,"Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord."
Shakespeare,How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
Shakespeare,"I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me."
Shakespeare,What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
Shakespeare,And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
Shakespeare,I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
Shakespeare,"'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,"
Shakespeare,And slaves they are to me that send them flying:
Shakespeare,"O, could their master come and go as lightly,"
Shakespeare,Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
Shakespeare,My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:
Shakespeare,"While I, their king, that hither them importune,"
Shakespeare,"Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,"
Shakespeare,Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
Shakespeare,"I curse myself, for they are sent by me,"
Shakespeare,That they should harbour where their lord would be.'
Shakespeare,"'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'"
Shakespeare,"'Tis so, and here's the ladder for the purpose."
Shakespeare,"Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--"
Shakespeare,Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
Shakespeare,And with thy daring folly burn the world?
Shakespeare,"Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?"
Shakespeare,"Go, base intruder! overweening slave!"
Shakespeare,"Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,"
Shakespeare,"And think my patience, more than thy desert,"
Shakespeare,Is privilege for thy departure hence:
Shakespeare,Thank me for this more than for all the favours
Shakespeare,Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
Shakespeare,But if thou linger in my territories
Shakespeare,Longer than swiftest expedition
Shakespeare,"Will give thee time to leave our royal court,"
Shakespeare,By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
Shakespeare,I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
Shakespeare,"Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse,"
Shakespeare,"But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence."
Shakespeare,And why not death rather than living torment?
Shakespeare,"To die is to be banish'd from myself,"
Shakespeare,And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her
Shakespeare,Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
Shakespeare,"What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?"
Shakespeare,"What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?"
Shakespeare,Unless it be to think that she is by
Shakespeare,And feed upon the shadow of perfection
Shakespeare,"Except I be by Silvia in the night,"
Shakespeare,"There is no music in the nightingale,"
Shakespeare,"Unless I look on Silvia in the day,"
Shakespeare,"There is no day for me to look upon,"
Shakespeare,"She is my essence, and I leave to be,"
Shakespeare,If I be not by her fair influence
Shakespeare,"Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive."
Shakespeare,"I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:"
Shakespeare,"Tarry I here, I but attend on death:"
Shakespeare,"But, fly I hence, I fly away from life."
Shakespeare,Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE
Shakespeare,"Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out."
Shakespeare,"Soho, soho!"
Shakespeare,What seest thou?
Shakespeare,Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head
Shakespeare,but 'tis a Valentine.
Shakespeare,Valentine?
Shakespeare,Who then? his spirit?
Shakespeare,"Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?"
Shakespeare,Who wouldst thou strike?
Shakespeare,"Villain, forbear."
Shakespeare,"Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--"
Shakespeare,"Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word."
Shakespeare,"My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,"
Shakespeare,So much of bad already hath possess'd them.
Shakespeare,"Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,"
Shakespeare,"For they are harsh, untuneable and bad."
Shakespeare,Is Silvia dead?
Shakespeare,"No, Valentine."
Shakespeare,"No, Valentine."
Shakespeare,"No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia."
Shakespeare,Hath she forsworn me?
Shakespeare,"No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me."
Shakespeare,What is your news?
Shakespeare,"Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished."
Shakespeare,"That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--"
Shakespeare,"From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend."
Shakespeare,"O, I have fed upon this woe already,"
Shakespeare,And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
Shakespeare,Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
Shakespeare,"Ay, ay, and she hath offer'd to the doom--"
Shakespeare,"Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--"
Shakespeare,"A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:"
Shakespeare,"Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd,"
Shakespeare,"With them, upon her knees, her humble self,"
Shakespeare,"Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them"
Shakespeare,As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
Shakespeare,"But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,"
Shakespeare,"Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,"
Shakespeare,"Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire,"
Shakespeare,"But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die."
Shakespeare,"Besides, her intercession chafed him so,"
Shakespeare,"When she for thy repeal was suppliant,"
Shakespeare,"That to close prison he commanded her,"
Shakespeare,With many bitter threats of biding there.
Shakespeare,"No more, unless the next word that thou speak'st"
Shakespeare,Have some malignant power upon my life:
Shakespeare,"If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,"
Shakespeare,As ending anthem of my endless dolour.
Shakespeare,"Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,"
Shakespeare,And study help for that which thou lament'st.
Shakespeare,Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
Shakespeare,"Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love,"
Shakespeare,"Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life."
Shakespeare,"Hope is a lover's staff, walk hence with that"
Shakespeare,And manage it against despairing thoughts.
Shakespeare,"Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence,"
Shakespeare,"Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd"
Shakespeare,Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
Shakespeare,The time now serves not to expostulate:
Shakespeare,"Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate,"
Shakespeare,"And, ere I part with thee, confer at large"
Shakespeare,Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.
Shakespeare,"As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,"
Shakespeare,"Regard thy danger, and along with me!"
Shakespeare,"I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,"
Shakespeare,Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.
Shakespeare,"Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine."
Shakespeare,O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!
Shakespeare,Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS
Shakespeare,"I am but a fool, look you, and yet I have the wit to"
Shakespeare,think my master is a kind of a knave: but that's
Shakespeare,"all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now"
Shakespeare,"that knows me to be in love, yet I am in love, but a"
Shakespeare,"team of horse shall not pluck that from me, nor who"
Shakespeare,"'tis I love, and yet 'tis a woman, but what woman, I"
Shakespeare,"will not tell myself, and yet 'tis a milkmaid, yet"
Shakespeare,"'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips, yet 'tis"
Shakespeare,"a maid, for she is her master's maid, and serves for"
Shakespeare,"wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel,"
Shakespeare,which is much in a bare Christian.
Shakespeare,Pulling out a paper
Shakespeare,Here is the cate-log of her condition.
Shakespeare,"'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why, a horse"
Shakespeare,"can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only"
Shakespeare,"carry, therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item:"
Shakespeare,"She can milk,' look you, a sweet virtue in a maid"
Shakespeare,with clean hands.
Shakespeare,"How now, Signior Launce! what news with your"
Shakespeare,mastership?
Shakespeare,"With my master's ship? why, it is at sea."
Shakespeare,"Well, your old vice still, mistake the word. What"
Shakespeare,"news, then, in your paper?"
Shakespeare,The blackest news that ever thou heardest.
Shakespeare,"Why, man, how black?"
Shakespeare,"Why, as black as ink."
Shakespeare,Let me read them.
Shakespeare,"Fie on thee, jolt-head! thou canst not read."
Shakespeare,"Thou liest, I can."
Shakespeare,I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee?
Shakespeare,"Marry, the son of my grandfather."
Shakespeare,O illiterate loiterer! it was the son of thy
Shakespeare,grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.
Shakespeare,"Come, fool, come, try me in thy paper."
Shakespeare,"There, and St. Nicholas be thy speed!"
Shakespeare,[Reads]  'Imprimis: She can milk.'
Shakespeare,"Ay, that she can."
Shakespeare,'Item: She brews good ale.'
Shakespeare,And thereof comes the proverb: 'Blessing of your
Shakespeare,"heart, you brew good ale.'"
Shakespeare,'Item: She can sew.'
Shakespeare,"That's as much as to say, Can she so?"
Shakespeare,'Item: She can knit.'
Shakespeare,"What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when"
Shakespeare,she can knit him a stock?
Shakespeare,'Item: She can wash and scour.'
Shakespeare,A special virtue: for then she need not be washed
Shakespeare,and scoured.
Shakespeare,'Item: She can spin.'
Shakespeare,"Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can"
Shakespeare,spin for her living.
Shakespeare,'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'
Shakespeare,"That's as much as to say, bastard virtues, that,"
Shakespeare,"indeed, know not their fathers and therefore have no names."
Shakespeare,'Here follow her vices.'
Shakespeare,Close at the heels of her virtues.
Shakespeare,'Item: She is not to be kissed fasting in respect
Shakespeare,of her breath.'
Shakespeare,"Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on."
Shakespeare,'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.'
Shakespeare,That makes amends for her sour breath.
Shakespeare,'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'
Shakespeare,"It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk."
Shakespeare,'Item: She is slow in words.'
Shakespeare,"O villain, that set this down among her vices! To"
Shakespeare,be slow in words is a woman's only virtue: I pray
Shakespeare,"thee, out with't, and place it for her chief virtue."
Shakespeare,'Item: She is proud.'
Shakespeare,"Out with that too, it was Eve's legacy, and cannot"
Shakespeare,be ta'en from her.
Shakespeare,'Item: She hath no teeth.'
Shakespeare,"I care not for that neither, because I love crusts."
Shakespeare,'Item: She is curst.'
Shakespeare,"Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite."
Shakespeare,'Item: She will often praise her liquor.'
Shakespeare,"If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will not, I"
Shakespeare,"will, for good things should be praised."
Shakespeare,'Item: She is too liberal.'
Shakespeare,"Of her tongue she cannot, for that's writ down she"
Shakespeare,"is slow of, of her purse she shall not, for that"
Shakespeare,"I'll keep shut: now, of another thing she may, and"
Shakespeare,"that cannot I help. Well, proceed."
Shakespeare,"'Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults"
Shakespeare,"than hairs, and more wealth than faults.'"
Shakespeare,"Stop there, I'll have her: she was mine, and not"
Shakespeare,"mine, twice or thrice in that last article."
Shakespeare,Rehearse that once more.
Shakespeare,"'Item: She hath more hair than wit,'--"
Shakespeare,"More hair than wit? It may be, I'll prove it. The"
Shakespeare,"cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it"
Shakespeare,"is more than the salt, the hair that covers the wit"
Shakespeare,"is more than the wit, for the greater hides the"
Shakespeare,less. What's next?
Shakespeare,"'And more faults than hairs,'--"
Shakespeare,"That's monstrous: O, that that were out!"
Shakespeare,'And more wealth than faults.'
Shakespeare,"Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well,"
Shakespeare,"I'll have her, and if it be a match, as nothing is"
Shakespeare,"impossible,--"
Shakespeare,"Why, then will I tell thee--that thy master stays"
Shakespeare,for thee at the North-gate.
Shakespeare,"For thee! ay, who art thou? he hath stayed for a"
Shakespeare,better man than thee.
Shakespeare,And must I go to him?
Shakespeare,"Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long"
Shakespeare,that going will scarce serve the turn.
Shakespeare,Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!
Shakespeare,"Now will he be swinged for reading my letter, an"
Shakespeare,"unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into"
Shakespeare,"secrets! I'll after, to rejoice in the boy's correction."
Shakespeare,SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.
Shakespeare,Enter DUKE and THURIO
Shakespeare,"Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,"
Shakespeare,Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.
Shakespeare,"Since his exile she hath despised me most,"
Shakespeare,"Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,"
Shakespeare,That I am desperate of obtaining her.
Shakespeare,This weak impress of love is as a figure
Shakespeare,"Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat"
Shakespeare,Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
Shakespeare,A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
Shakespeare,And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
Shakespeare,"How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman"
Shakespeare,According to our proclamation gone?
Shakespeare,"Gone, my good lord."
Shakespeare,My daughter takes his going grievously.
Shakespeare,"A little time, my lord, will kill that grief."
Shakespeare,"So I believe, but Thurio thinks not so."
Shakespeare,"Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--"
Shakespeare,For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
Shakespeare,Makes me the better to confer with thee.
Shakespeare,Longer than I prove loyal to your grace
Shakespeare,Let me not live to look upon your grace.
Shakespeare,Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
Shakespeare,The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.
Shakespeare,"And also, I think, thou art not ignorant"
Shakespeare,How she opposes her against my will
Shakespeare,"She did, my lord, when Valentine was here."
Shakespeare,"Ay, and perversely she persevers so."
Shakespeare,What might we do to make the girl forget
Shakespeare,The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?
Shakespeare,The best way is to slander Valentine
Shakespeare,"With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,"
Shakespeare,Three things that women highly hold in hate.
Shakespeare,"Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate."
Shakespeare,"Ay, if his enemy deliver it:"
Shakespeare,Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
Shakespeare,By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
Shakespeare,Then you must undertake to slander him.
Shakespeare,"And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:"
Shakespeare,"'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,"
Shakespeare,Especially against his very friend.
Shakespeare,"Where your good word cannot advantage him,"
Shakespeare,"Your slander never can endamage him,"
Shakespeare,"Therefore the office is indifferent,"
Shakespeare,Being entreated to it by your friend.
Shakespeare,"You have prevail'd, my lord, if I can do it"
Shakespeare,"By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,"
Shakespeare,She shall not long continue love to him.
Shakespeare,"But say this weed her love from Valentine,"
Shakespeare,It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
Shakespeare,"Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,"
Shakespeare,"Lest it should ravel and be good to none,"
Shakespeare,"You must provide to bottom it on me,"
Shakespeare,Which must be done by praising me as much
Shakespeare,As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
Shakespeare,"And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,"
Shakespeare,"Because we know, on Valentine's report,"
Shakespeare,You are already Love's firm votary
Shakespeare,And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
Shakespeare,Upon this warrant shall you have access
Shakespeare,"Where you with Silvia may confer at large,"
Shakespeare,"For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,"
Shakespeare,"And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you,"
Shakespeare,Where you may temper her by your persuasion
Shakespeare,To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
Shakespeare,"As much as I can do, I will effect:"
Shakespeare,"But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough,"
Shakespeare,You must lay lime to tangle her desires
Shakespeare,"By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes"
Shakespeare,Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
Shakespeare,Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
Shakespeare,Say that upon the altar of her beauty
Shakespeare,"You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:"
Shakespeare,"Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears"
Shakespeare,"Moist it again, and frame some feeling line"
Shakespeare,That may discover such integrity:
Shakespeare,"For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,"
Shakespeare,"Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,"
Shakespeare,Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
Shakespeare,Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
Shakespeare,"After your dire-lamenting elegies,"
Shakespeare,Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
Shakespeare,"With some sweet concert, to their instruments"
Shakespeare,Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
Shakespeare,Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
Shakespeare,"This, or else nothing, will inherit her."
Shakespeare,This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
Shakespeare,And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
Shakespeare,"Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,"
Shakespeare,Let us into the city presently
Shakespeare,To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
Shakespeare,I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
Shakespeare,To give the onset to thy good advice.
Shakespeare,"About it, gentlemen!"
Shakespeare,"We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,"
Shakespeare,And afterward determine our proceedings.
Shakespeare,Even now about it! I will pardon you.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. The frontiers of Mantua. A forest.
Shakespeare,Enter certain Outlaws
Shakespeare,"Fellows, stand fast, I see a passenger."
Shakespeare,"If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em."
Shakespeare,"Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:"
Shakespeare,If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.
Shakespeare,"Sir, we are undone, these are the villains"
Shakespeare,That all the travellers do fear so much.
Shakespeare,"My friends,--"
Shakespeare,"That's not so, sir: we are your enemies."
Shakespeare,Peace! we'll hear him.
Shakespeare,"Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man."
Shakespeare,Then know that I have little wealth to lose:
Shakespeare,"A man I am cross'd with adversity,"
Shakespeare,"My riches are these poor habiliments,"
Shakespeare,"Of which if you should here disfurnish me,"
Shakespeare,You take the sum and substance that I have.
Shakespeare,Whither travel you?
Shakespeare,To Verona.
Shakespeare,Whence came you?
Shakespeare,From Milan.
Shakespeare,Have you long sojourned there?
Shakespeare,"Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,"
Shakespeare,If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
Shakespeare,"What, were you banish'd thence?"
Shakespeare,I was.
Shakespeare,For that which now torments me to rehearse:
Shakespeare,"I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent,"
Shakespeare,"Bu t yet I slew him manfully in fight,"
Shakespeare,Without false vantage or base treachery.
Shakespeare,"Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so."
Shakespeare,But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
Shakespeare,"I was, and held me glad of such a doom."
Shakespeare,Have you the tongues?
Shakespeare,"My youthful travel therein made me happy,"
Shakespeare,Or else I often had been miserable.
Shakespeare,"By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,"
Shakespeare,This fellow were a king for our wild faction!
Shakespeare,"We'll have him. Sirs, a word."
Shakespeare,"Master, be one of them, it's an honourable kind of thievery."
Shakespeare,"Peace, villain!"
Shakespeare,Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?
Shakespeare,Nothing but my fortune.
Shakespeare,"Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,"
Shakespeare,Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
Shakespeare,Thrust from the company of awful men:
Shakespeare,Myself was from Verona banished
Shakespeare,"For practising to steal away a lady,"
Shakespeare,"An heir, and near allied unto the duke."
Shakespeare,"And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,"
Shakespeare,"Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart."
Shakespeare,"And I for such like petty crimes as these,"
Shakespeare,"But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,"
Shakespeare,"That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives,"
Shakespeare,"And partly, seeing you are beautified"
Shakespeare,With goodly shape and by your own report
Shakespeare,A linguist and a man of such perfection
Shakespeare,As we do in our quality much want--
Shakespeare,"Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,"
Shakespeare,"Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:"
Shakespeare,Are you content to be our general?
Shakespeare,To make a virtue of necessity
Shakespeare,"And live, as we do, in this wilderness?"
Shakespeare,What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
Shakespeare,"Say ay, and be the captain of us all:"
Shakespeare,"We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,"
Shakespeare,Love thee as our commander and our king.
Shakespeare,"But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest."
Shakespeare,Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
Shakespeare,"I take your offer and will live with you,"
Shakespeare,Provided that you do no outrages
Shakespeare,On silly women or poor passengers.
Shakespeare,"No, we detest such vile base practises."
Shakespeare,"Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,"
Shakespeare,"And show thee all the treasure we have got,"
Shakespeare,"Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose."
Shakespeare,"SCENE II. Milan. Outside the DUKE's palace, under SILVIA's chamber."
Shakespeare,Already have I been false to Valentine
Shakespeare,And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
Shakespeare,"Under the colour of commending him,"
Shakespeare,I have access my own love to prefer:
Shakespeare,"But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,"
Shakespeare,To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
Shakespeare,"When I protest true loyalty to her,"
Shakespeare,"She twits me with my falsehood to my friend,"
Shakespeare,"When to her beauty I commend my vows,"
Shakespeare,She bids me think how I have been forsworn
Shakespeare,In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:
Shakespeare,"And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,"
Shakespeare,"The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,"
Shakespeare,"Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,"
Shakespeare,The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
Shakespeare,"But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,"
Shakespeare,And give some evening music to her ear.
Shakespeare,Enter THURIO and Musicians
Shakespeare,"How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love"
Shakespeare,Will creep in service where it cannot go.
Shakespeare,"Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here."
Shakespeare,"Sir, but I do, or else I would be hence."
Shakespeare,Who? Silvia?
Shakespeare,"Ay, Silvia, for your sake."
Shakespeare,"I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,"
Shakespeare,"Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile."
Shakespeare,"Enter, at a distance, Host, and JULIA in boy's clothes"
Shakespeare,"Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I"
Shakespeare,"pray you, why is it?"
Shakespeare,"Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry."
Shakespeare,"Come, we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where"
Shakespeare,you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.
Shakespeare,But shall I hear him speak?
Shakespeare,"Ay, that you shall."
Shakespeare,That will be music.
Shakespeare,Is he among these?
Shakespeare,"Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em."
Shakespeare,"Who is Silvia? what is she,"
Shakespeare,That all our swains commend her?
Shakespeare,"Holy, fair and wise is she,"
Shakespeare,"The heaven such grace did lend her,"
Shakespeare,That she might admired be.
Shakespeare,Is she kind as she is fair?
Shakespeare,For beauty lives with kindness.
Shakespeare,"Love doth to her eyes repair,"
Shakespeare,"To help him of his blindness,"
Shakespeare,"And, being help'd, inhabits there."
Shakespeare,"Then to Silvia let us sing,"
Shakespeare,"That Silvia is excelling,"
Shakespeare,She excels each mortal thing
Shakespeare,Upon the dull earth dwelling:
Shakespeare,To her let us garlands bring.
Shakespeare,How now! are you sadder than you were before? How
Shakespeare,"do you, man? the music likes you not."
Shakespeare,"You mistake, the musician likes me not."
Shakespeare,"Why, my pretty youth?"
Shakespeare,"He plays false, father."
Shakespeare,How? out of tune on the strings?
Shakespeare,"Not so, but yet so false that he grieves my very"
Shakespeare,heart-strings.
Shakespeare,You have a quick ear.
Shakespeare,"Ay, I would I were deaf, it makes me have a slow heart."
Shakespeare,I perceive you delight not in music.
Shakespeare,"Not a whit, when it jars so."
Shakespeare,"Hark, what fine change is in the music!"
Shakespeare,"Ay, that change is the spite."
Shakespeare,You would have them always play but one thing?
Shakespeare,I would always have one play but one thing.
Shakespeare,"But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on"
Shakespeare,Often resort unto this gentlewoman?
Shakespeare,"I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved"
Shakespeare,her out of all nick.
Shakespeare,Where is Launce?
Shakespeare,"Gone to seek his dog, which tomorrow, by his"
Shakespeare,"master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady."
Shakespeare,Peace! stand aside: the company parts.
Shakespeare,"Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead"
Shakespeare,That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
Shakespeare,Where meet we?
Shakespeare,At Saint Gregory's well.
Shakespeare,Exeunt THURIO and Musicians
Shakespeare,Enter SILVIA above
Shakespeare,Enter SILVIA above
Shakespeare,"Madam, good even to your ladyship."
Shakespeare,"I thank you for your music, gentlemen."
Shakespeare,Who is that that spake?
Shakespeare,"One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,"
Shakespeare,You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.
Shakespeare,"Sir Proteus, as I take it."
Shakespeare,"Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant."
Shakespeare,That I may compass yours.
Shakespeare,"You have your wish, my will is even this:"
Shakespeare,That presently you hie you home to bed.
Shakespeare,"Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!"
Shakespeare,"Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,"
Shakespeare,"To be seduced by thy flattery,"
Shakespeare,That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
Shakespeare,"Return, return, and make thy love amends."
Shakespeare,"For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,"
Shakespeare,I am so far from granting thy request
Shakespeare,"That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,"
Shakespeare,And by and by intend to chide myself
Shakespeare,Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.
Shakespeare,"I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady,"
Shakespeare,But she is dead.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]        'Twere false, if I should speak it,"
Shakespeare,For I am sure she is not buried.
Shakespeare,"Say that she be, yet Valentine thy friend"
Shakespeare,"Survives, to whom, thyself art witness,"
Shakespeare,I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed
Shakespeare,To wrong him with thy importunacy?
Shakespeare,I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.
Shakespeare,"And so suppose am I, for in his grave"
Shakespeare,Assure thyself my love is buried.
Shakespeare,"Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth."
Shakespeare,"Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,"
Shakespeare,"Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine."
Shakespeare,[Aside]  He heard not that.
Shakespeare,"Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,"
Shakespeare,"Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,"
Shakespeare,"The picture that is hanging in your chamber,"
Shakespeare,"To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:"
Shakespeare,For since the substance of your perfect self
Shakespeare,"Is else devoted, I am but a shadow,"
Shakespeare,And to your shadow will I make true love.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  If 'twere a substance, you would, sure,"
Shakespeare,"deceive it,"
Shakespeare,"And make it but a shadow, as I am."
Shakespeare,"I am very loath to be your idol, sir,"
Shakespeare,But since your falsehood shall become you well
Shakespeare,"To worship shadows and adore false shapes,"
Shakespeare,Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:
Shakespeare,"And so, good rest."
Shakespeare,As wretches have o'ernight
Shakespeare,That wait for execution in the morn.
Shakespeare,Exeunt PROTEUS and SILVIA severally
Shakespeare,"Host, will you go?"
Shakespeare,"By my halidom, I was fast asleep."
Shakespeare,"Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?"
Shakespeare,"Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost"
Shakespeare,day.
Shakespeare,"Not so, but it hath been the longest night"
Shakespeare,That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.
Shakespeare,Enter EGLAMOUR
Shakespeare,Enter EGLAMOUR
Shakespeare,This is the hour that Madam Silvia
Shakespeare,Entreated me to call and know her mind:
Shakespeare,There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.
Shakespeare,"Madam, madam!"
Shakespeare,"Your servant and your friend,"
Shakespeare,One that attends your ladyship's command.
Shakespeare,"Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow."
Shakespeare,"As many, worthy lady, to yourself:"
Shakespeare,"According to your ladyship's impose,"
Shakespeare,I am thus early come to know what service
Shakespeare,It is your pleasure to command me in.
Shakespeare,"O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--"
Shakespeare,"Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--"
Shakespeare,"Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd:"
Shakespeare,Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
Shakespeare,"I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,"
Shakespeare,Nor how my father would enforce me marry
Shakespeare,"Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors."
Shakespeare,"Thyself hast loved, and I have heard thee say"
Shakespeare,No grief did ever come so near thy heart
Shakespeare,"As when thy lady and thy true love died,"
Shakespeare,Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.
Shakespeare,"Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,"
Shakespeare,"To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode,"
Shakespeare,"And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,"
Shakespeare,"I do desire thy worthy company,"
Shakespeare,Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
Shakespeare,"Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,"
Shakespeare,"But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,"
Shakespeare,"And on the justice of my flying hence,"
Shakespeare,"To keep me from a most unholy match,"
Shakespeare,Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
Shakespeare,"I do desire thee, even from a heart"
Shakespeare,"As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,"
Shakespeare,To bear me company and go with me:
Shakespeare,"If not, to hide what I have said to thee,"
Shakespeare,That I may venture to depart alone.
Shakespeare,"Madam, I pity much your grievances,"
Shakespeare,"Which since I know they virtuously are placed,"
Shakespeare,"I give consent to go along with you,"
Shakespeare,Recking as little what betideth me
Shakespeare,As much I wish all good befortune you.
Shakespeare,When will you go?
Shakespeare,This evening coming.
Shakespeare,Where shall I meet you?
Shakespeare,"At Friar Patrick's cell,"
Shakespeare,Where I intend holy confession.
Shakespeare,"I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady."
Shakespeare,"Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour."
Shakespeare,"Enter LAUNCE, with his his Dog"
Shakespeare,"When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,"
Shakespeare,"look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a"
Shakespeare,"puppy, one that I saved from drowning, when three or"
Shakespeare,four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
Shakespeare,"I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,"
Shakespeare,'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver
Shakespeare,"him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master,"
Shakespeare,and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
Shakespeare,steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:
Shakespeare,"O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself"
Shakespeare,"in all companies! I would have, as one should say,"
Shakespeare,"one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,"
Shakespeare,"as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had"
Shakespeare,"more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,"
Shakespeare,"I think verily he had been hanged for't, sure as I"
Shakespeare,"live, he had suffered for't, you shall judge. He"
Shakespeare,thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
Shakespeare,gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
Shakespeare,"not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but"
Shakespeare,all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
Shakespeare,one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
Shakespeare,out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
Shakespeare,"I, having been acquainted with the smell before,"
Shakespeare,"knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that"
Shakespeare,"whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip"
Shakespeare,"the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him"
Shakespeare,"the more wrong,' quoth I, ''twas I did the thing you"
Shakespeare,"wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out"
Shakespeare,of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
Shakespeare,"his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the"
Shakespeare,"stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had"
Shakespeare,"been executed, I have stood on the pillory for geese"
Shakespeare,"he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't."
Shakespeare,"Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the"
Shakespeare,trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
Shakespeare,Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
Shakespeare,do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
Shakespeare,water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst
Shakespeare,thou ever see me do such a trick?
Shakespeare,Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well
Shakespeare,And will employ thee in some service presently.
Shakespeare,In what you please: I'll do what I can.
Shakespeare,I hope thou wilt.
Shakespeare,To LAUNCE
Shakespeare,"How now, you whoreson peasant!"
Shakespeare,Where have you been these two days loitering?
Shakespeare,"Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me."
Shakespeare,And what says she to my little jewel?
Shakespeare,"Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you"
Shakespeare,currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
Shakespeare,But she received my dog?
Shakespeare,"No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him"
Shakespeare,back again.
Shakespeare,"What, didst thou offer her this from me?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by"
Shakespeare,the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
Shakespeare,"offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of"
Shakespeare,"yours, and therefore the gift the greater."
Shakespeare,"Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,"
Shakespeare,Or ne'er return again into my sight.
Shakespeare,"Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?"
Shakespeare,Exit LAUNCE
Shakespeare,"A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!"
Shakespeare,"Sebastian, I have entertained thee,"
Shakespeare,Partly that I have need of such a youth
Shakespeare,"That can with some discretion do my business,"
Shakespeare,"For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,"
Shakespeare,"But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,"
Shakespeare,"Which, if my augury deceive me not,"
Shakespeare,"Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:"
Shakespeare,"Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee."
Shakespeare,"Go presently and take this ring with thee,"
Shakespeare,Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
Shakespeare,She loved me well deliver'd it to me.
Shakespeare,"It seems you loved not her, to leave her token."
Shakespeare,"She is dead, belike?"
Shakespeare,"Not so, I think she lives."
Shakespeare,Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
Shakespeare,I cannot choose
Shakespeare,But pity her.
Shakespeare,Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
Shakespeare,Because methinks that she loved you as well
Shakespeare,As you do love your lady Silvia:
Shakespeare,"She dreams of him that has forgot her love,"
Shakespeare,You dote on her that cares not for your love.
Shakespeare,"'Tis pity love should be so contrary,"
Shakespeare,And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'
Shakespeare,"Well, give her that ring and therewithal"
Shakespeare,This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
Shakespeare,I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
Shakespeare,"Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,"
Shakespeare,"Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary."
Shakespeare,How many women would do such a message?
Shakespeare,"Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd"
Shakespeare,A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
Shakespeare,"Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him"
Shakespeare,That with his very heart despiseth me?
Shakespeare,"Because he loves her, he despiseth me,"
Shakespeare,Because I love him I must pity him.
Shakespeare,"This ring I gave him when he parted from me,"
Shakespeare,"To bind him to remember my good will,"
Shakespeare,"And now am I, unhappy messenger,"
Shakespeare,"To plead for that which I would not obtain,"
Shakespeare,"To carry that which I would have refused,"
Shakespeare,To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
Shakespeare,"I am my master's true-confirmed love,"
Shakespeare,"But cannot be true servant to my master,"
Shakespeare,Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
Shakespeare,"Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly"
Shakespeare,"As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed."
Shakespeare,"Enter SILVIA, attended"
Shakespeare,"Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean"
Shakespeare,To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
Shakespeare,"What would you with her, if that I be she?"
Shakespeare,"If you be she, I do entreat your patience"
Shakespeare,To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
Shakespeare,From whom?
Shakespeare,"From my master, Sir Proteus, madam."
Shakespeare,"O, he sends you for a picture."
Shakespeare,"Ursula, bring my picture here."
Shakespeare,"Go give your master this: tell him from me,"
Shakespeare,"One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,"
Shakespeare,Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
Shakespeare,"Madam, please you peruse this letter.--"
Shakespeare,"Pardon me, madam, I have unadvised"
Shakespeare,Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
Shakespeare,This is the letter to your ladyship.
Shakespeare,"I pray thee, let me look on that again."
Shakespeare,"It may not be, good madam, pardon me."
Shakespeare,"There, hold!"
Shakespeare,I will not look upon your master's lines:
Shakespeare,I know they are stuff'd with protestations
Shakespeare,"And full of new-found oaths, which he will break"
Shakespeare,As easily as I do tear his paper.
Shakespeare,"Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring."
Shakespeare,"The more shame for him that he sends it me,"
Shakespeare,For I have heard him say a thousand times
Shakespeare,His Julia gave it him at his departure.
Shakespeare,"Though his false finger have profaned the ring,"
Shakespeare,Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
Shakespeare,She thanks you.
Shakespeare,"I thank you, madam, that you tender her."
Shakespeare,Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
Shakespeare,Dost thou know her?
Shakespeare,Almost as well as I do know myself:
Shakespeare,To think upon her woes I do protest
Shakespeare,That I have wept a hundred several times.
Shakespeare,Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
Shakespeare,"I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow."
Shakespeare,Is she not passing fair?
Shakespeare,"She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:"
Shakespeare,"When she did think my master loved her well,"
Shakespeare,"She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:"
Shakespeare,But since she did neglect her looking-glass
Shakespeare,"And threw her sun-expelling mask away,"
Shakespeare,The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
Shakespeare,"And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,"
Shakespeare,That now she is become as black as I.
Shakespeare,How tall was she?
Shakespeare,"About my stature, for at Pentecost,"
Shakespeare,"When all our pageants of delight were play'd,"
Shakespeare,"Our youth got me to play the woman's part,"
Shakespeare,"And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,"
Shakespeare,"Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,"
Shakespeare,As if the garment had been made for me:
Shakespeare,Therefore I know she is about my height.
Shakespeare,"And at that time I made her weep agood,"
Shakespeare,For I did play a lamentable part:
Shakespeare,"Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning"
Shakespeare,"For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight,"
Shakespeare,Which I so lively acted with my tears
Shakespeare,"That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,"
Shakespeare,"Wept bitterly, and would I might be dead"
Shakespeare,If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
Shakespeare,"She is beholding to thee, gentle youth."
Shakespeare,"Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!"
Shakespeare,I weep myself to think upon thy words.
Shakespeare,"Here, youth, there is my purse, I give thee this"
Shakespeare,"For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her."
Shakespeare,"Exit SILVIA, with attendants"
Shakespeare,"And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her."
Shakespeare,"A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful"
Shakespeare,"I hope my master's suit will be but cold,"
Shakespeare,Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
Shakespeare,"Alas, how love can trifle with itself!"
Shakespeare,"Here is her picture: let me see, I think,"
Shakespeare,"If I had such a tire, this face of mine"
Shakespeare,Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
Shakespeare,"And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,"
Shakespeare,Unless I flatter with myself too much.
Shakespeare,"Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:"
Shakespeare,"If that be all the difference in his love,"
Shakespeare,I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
Shakespeare,"Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:"
Shakespeare,"Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high."
Shakespeare,What should it be that he respects in her
Shakespeare,"But I can make respective in myself,"
Shakespeare,If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
Shakespeare,"Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,"
Shakespeare,"For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,"
Shakespeare,"Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!"
Shakespeare,"And, were there sense in his idolatry,"
Shakespeare,My substance should be statue in thy stead.
Shakespeare,"I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,"
Shakespeare,"That used me so, or else, by Jove I vow,"
Shakespeare,I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
Shakespeare,To make my master out of love with thee!
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Milan. An abbey.
Shakespeare,"The sun begins to gild the western sky,"
Shakespeare,And now it is about the very hour
Shakespeare,"That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me."
Shakespeare,"She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,"
Shakespeare,"Unless it be to come before their time,"
Shakespeare,So much they spur their expedition.
Shakespeare,See where she comes.
Shakespeare,"Lady, a happy evening!"
Shakespeare,"Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,"
Shakespeare,Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:
Shakespeare,I fear I am attended by some spies.
Shakespeare,"Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off,"
Shakespeare,"If we recover that, we are sure enough."
Shakespeare,"Enter THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA"
Shakespeare,"Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?"
Shakespeare,"O, sir, I find her milder than she was,"
Shakespeare,And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
Shakespeare,"What, that my leg is too long?"
Shakespeare,"No, that it is too little."
Shakespeare,"I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder."
Shakespeare,[Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what
Shakespeare,it loathes.
Shakespeare,What says she to my face?
Shakespeare,She says it is a fair one.
Shakespeare,"Nay then, the wanton lies, my face is black."
Shakespeare,"But pearls are fair, and the old saying is,"
Shakespeare,Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  'Tis true, such pearls as put out"
Shakespeare,"ladies' eyes,"
Shakespeare,For I had rather wink than look on them.
Shakespeare,How likes she my discourse?
Shakespeare,"Ill, when you talk of war."
Shakespeare,"But well, when I discourse of love and peace?"
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace."
Shakespeare,What says she to my valour?
Shakespeare,"O, sir, she makes no doubt of that."
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice."
Shakespeare,What says she to my birth?
Shakespeare,That you are well derived.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  True, from a gentleman to a fool."
Shakespeare,Considers she my possessions?
Shakespeare,"O, ay, and pities them."
Shakespeare,[Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
Shakespeare,That they are out by lease.
Shakespeare,Here comes the duke.
Shakespeare,"How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!"
Shakespeare,Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?
Shakespeare,Saw you my daughter?
Shakespeare,"Why then,"
Shakespeare,"She's fled unto that peasant Valentine,"
Shakespeare,And Eglamour is in her company.
Shakespeare,"'Tis true, for Friar Laurence met them both,"
Shakespeare,"As he in penance wander'd through the forest,"
Shakespeare,"Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,"
Shakespeare,"But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it,"
Shakespeare,"Besides, she did intend confession"
Shakespeare,"At Patrick's cell this even, and there she was not,"
Shakespeare,These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
Shakespeare,"Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,"
Shakespeare,But mount you presently and meet with me
Shakespeare,Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
Shakespeare,"That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:"
Shakespeare,"Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me."
Shakespeare,"Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,"
Shakespeare,That flies her fortune when it follows her.
Shakespeare,"I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour"
Shakespeare,Than for the love of reckless Silvia.
Shakespeare,"And I will follow, more for Silvia's love"
Shakespeare,Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.
Shakespeare,"And I will follow, more to cross that love"
Shakespeare,Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.
Shakespeare,SCENE III. The frontiers of Mantua. The forest.
Shakespeare,Enter Outlaws with SILVIA
Shakespeare,"Be patient, we must bring you to our captain."
Shakespeare,A thousand more mischances than this one
Shakespeare,Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.
Shakespeare,"Come, bring her away."
Shakespeare,Where is the gentleman that was with her?
Shakespeare,"Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,"
Shakespeare,But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
Shakespeare,"Go thou with her to the west end of the wood,"
Shakespeare,"There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled,"
Shakespeare,"The thicket is beset, he cannot 'scape."
Shakespeare,"Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:"
Shakespeare,"Fear not, he bears an honourable mind,"
Shakespeare,And will not use a woman lawlessly.
Shakespeare,"O Valentine, this I endure for thee!"
Shakespeare,How use doth breed a habit in a man!
Shakespeare,"This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,"
Shakespeare,I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
Shakespeare,"Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,"
Shakespeare,And to the nightingale's complaining notes
Shakespeare,Tune my distresses and record my woes.
Shakespeare,"O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,"
Shakespeare,"Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,"
Shakespeare,"Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall"
Shakespeare,And leave no memory of what it was!
Shakespeare,"Repair me with thy presence, Silvia,"
Shakespeare,"Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!"
Shakespeare,What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
Shakespeare,"These are my mates, that make their wills their law,"
Shakespeare,Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
Shakespeare,"They love me well, yet I have much to do"
Shakespeare,To keep them from uncivil outrages.
Shakespeare,"Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?"
Shakespeare,"Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA"
Shakespeare,"Madam, this service I have done for you,"
Shakespeare,"Though you respect not aught your servant doth,"
Shakespeare,To hazard life and rescue you from him
Shakespeare,"That would have forced your honour and your love,"
Shakespeare,"Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look,"
Shakespeare,A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
Shakespeare,"And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give."
Shakespeare,[Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
Shakespeare,"Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile."
Shakespeare,"O miserable, unhappy that I am!"
Shakespeare,"Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came,"
Shakespeare,But by my coming I have made you happy.
Shakespeare,By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence."
Shakespeare,"Had I been seized by a hungry lion,"
Shakespeare,"I would have been a breakfast to the beast,"
Shakespeare,Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
Shakespeare,"O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,"
Shakespeare,Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
Shakespeare,"And full as much, for more there cannot be,"
Shakespeare,I do detest false perjured Proteus.
Shakespeare,"Therefore be gone, solicit me no more."
Shakespeare,"What dangerous action, stood it next to death,"
Shakespeare,Would I not undergo for one calm look!
Shakespeare,"O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,"
Shakespeare,When women cannot love where they're beloved!
Shakespeare,When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
Shakespeare,"Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,"
Shakespeare,For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
Shakespeare,"Into a thousand oaths, and all those oaths"
Shakespeare,"Descended into perjury, to love me."
Shakespeare,"Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two,"
Shakespeare,"And that's far worse than none, better have none"
Shakespeare,Than plural faith which is too much by one:
Shakespeare,Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
Shakespeare,In love
Shakespeare,Who respects friend?
Shakespeare,All men but Proteus.
Shakespeare,"Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words"
Shakespeare,"Can no way change you to a milder form,"
Shakespeare,"I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,"
Shakespeare,"And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye."
Shakespeare,O heaven!
Shakespeare,I'll force thee yield to my desire.
Shakespeare,"Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,"
Shakespeare,Thou friend of an ill fashion!
Shakespeare,Valentine!
Shakespeare,"Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,"
Shakespeare,"For such is a friend now, treacherous man!"
Shakespeare,"Thou hast beguiled my hopes, nought but mine eye"
Shakespeare,Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
Shakespeare,"I have one friend alive, thou wouldst disprove me."
Shakespeare,"Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand"
Shakespeare,"Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,"
Shakespeare,"I am sorry I must never trust thee more,"
Shakespeare,But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
Shakespeare,"The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,"
Shakespeare,'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
Shakespeare,My shame and guilt confounds me.
Shakespeare,"Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow"
Shakespeare,"Be a sufficient ransom for offence,"
Shakespeare,"I tender 't here, I do as truly suffer"
Shakespeare,As e'er I did commit.
Shakespeare,"Then I am paid,"
Shakespeare,And once again I do receive thee honest.
Shakespeare,Who by repentance is not satisfied
Shakespeare,"Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased."
Shakespeare,By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
Shakespeare,"And, that my love may appear plain and free,"
Shakespeare,All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
Shakespeare,O me unhappy!
Shakespeare,Swoons
Shakespeare,Look to the boy.
Shakespeare,"Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?"
Shakespeare,"Look up, speak."
Shakespeare,"O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring"
Shakespeare,"to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done."
Shakespeare,"Where is that ring, boy?"
Shakespeare,"Here 'tis, this is it."
Shakespeare,How! let me see:
Shakespeare,"Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia."
Shakespeare,"O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:"
Shakespeare,This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
Shakespeare,But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
Shakespeare,I gave this unto Julia.
Shakespeare,"And Julia herself did give it me,"
Shakespeare,And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
Shakespeare,How! Julia!
Shakespeare,"Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,"
Shakespeare,And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
Shakespeare,How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
Shakespeare,"O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!"
Shakespeare,Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
Shakespeare,"Such an immodest raiment, if shame live"
Shakespeare,In a disguise of love:
Shakespeare,"It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,"
Shakespeare,Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
Shakespeare,Than men their minds! 'tis true.
Shakespeare,O heaven! were man
Shakespeare,"But constant, he were perfect. That one error"
Shakespeare,"Fills him with faults, makes him run through all the sins:"
Shakespeare,Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
Shakespeare,"What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy"
Shakespeare,More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
Shakespeare,"Come, come, a hand from either:"
Shakespeare,"Let me be blest to make this happy close,"
Shakespeare,'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
Shakespeare,"Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever."
Shakespeare,And I mine.
Shakespeare,"Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO"
Shakespeare,"A prize, a prize, a prize!"
Shakespeare,"Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke."
Shakespeare,"Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,"
Shakespeare,Banished Valentine.
Shakespeare,Sir Valentine!
Shakespeare,"Yonder is Silvia, and Silvia's mine."
Shakespeare,"Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death,"
Shakespeare,"Come not within the measure of my wrath,"
Shakespeare,"Do not name Silvia thine, if once again,"
Shakespeare,"Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands,"
Shakespeare,Take but possession of her with a touch:
Shakespeare,I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
Shakespeare,"Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I,"
Shakespeare,I hold him but a fool that will endanger
Shakespeare,His body for a girl that loves him not:
Shakespeare,"I claim her not, and therefore she is thine."
Shakespeare,"The more degenerate and base art thou,"
Shakespeare,To make such means for her as thou hast done
Shakespeare,And leave her on such slight conditions.
Shakespeare,"Now, by the honour of my ancestry,"
Shakespeare,"I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,"
Shakespeare,And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
Shakespeare,"Know then, I here forget all former griefs,"
Shakespeare,"Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,"
Shakespeare,"Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,"
Shakespeare,"To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,"
Shakespeare,"Thou art a gentleman and well derived,"
Shakespeare,"Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her."
Shakespeare,"I thank your grace, the gift hath made me happy."
Shakespeare,"I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,"
Shakespeare,To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.
Shakespeare,"I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be."
Shakespeare,These banish'd men that I have kept withal
Shakespeare,Are men endued with worthy qualities:
Shakespeare,Forgive them what they have committed here
Shakespeare,And let them be recall'd from their exile:
Shakespeare,"They are reformed, civil, full of good"
Shakespeare,"And fit for great employment, worthy lord."
Shakespeare,"Thou hast prevail'd, I pardon them and thee:"
Shakespeare,Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
Shakespeare,"Come, let us go: we will include all jars"
Shakespeare,"With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity."
Shakespeare,"And, as we walk along, I dare be bold"
Shakespeare,With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
Shakespeare,"What think you of this page, my lord?"
Shakespeare,"I think the boy hath grace in him, he blushes."
Shakespeare,"I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy."
Shakespeare,What mean you by that saying?
Shakespeare,"Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,"
Shakespeare,That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
Shakespeare,"Come, Proteus, 'tis your penance but to hear"
Shakespeare,The story of your loves discovered:
Shakespeare,"That done, our day of marriage shall be yours,"
Shakespeare,"One feast, one house, one mutual happiness."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.
Shakespeare,Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS
Shakespeare,"If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on"
Shakespeare,the like occasion whereon my services are now on
Shakespeare,"foot, you shall see, as I have said, great"
Shakespeare,difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
Shakespeare,"I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia"
Shakespeare,means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
Shakespeare,Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
Shakespeare,"justified in our loves, for indeed--"
Shakespeare,"Beseech you,--"
Shakespeare,"Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:"
Shakespeare,we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
Shakespeare,"not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,"
Shakespeare,"that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,"
Shakespeare,"may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse"
Shakespeare,us.
Shakespeare,You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
Shakespeare,"Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me"
Shakespeare,and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
Shakespeare,Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
Shakespeare,"They were trained together in their childhoods, and"
Shakespeare,"there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,"
Shakespeare,which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
Shakespeare,more mature dignities and royal necessities made
Shakespeare,"separation of their society, their encounters,"
Shakespeare,"though not personal, have been royally attorneyed"
Shakespeare,"with interchange of gifts, letters, loving"
Shakespeare,"embassies, that they have seemed to be together,"
Shakespeare,"though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and"
Shakespeare,"embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed"
Shakespeare,winds. The heavens continue their loves!
Shakespeare,I think there is not in the world either malice or
Shakespeare,matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
Shakespeare,comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
Shakespeare,gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
Shakespeare,into my note.
Shakespeare,I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
Shakespeare,"is a gallant child, one that indeed physics the"
Shakespeare,"subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on"
Shakespeare,crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
Shakespeare,see him a man.
Shakespeare,Would they else be content to die?
Shakespeare,"Yes, if there were no other excuse why they should"
Shakespeare,desire to live.
Shakespeare,"If the king had no son, they would desire to live"
Shakespeare,on crutches till he had one.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. A room of state in the same.
Shakespeare,"Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants"
Shakespeare,Nine changes of the watery star hath been
Shakespeare,The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
Shakespeare,Without a burthen: time as long again
Shakespeare,"Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks,"
Shakespeare,"And yet we should, for perpetuity,"
Shakespeare,"Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,"
Shakespeare,"Yet standing in rich place, I multiply"
Shakespeare,With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
Shakespeare,That go before it.
Shakespeare,"Stay your thanks a while,"
Shakespeare,And pay them when you part.
Shakespeare,"Sir, that's to-morrow."
Shakespeare,"I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance"
Shakespeare,"Or breed upon our absence, that may blow"
Shakespeare,"No sneaping winds at home, to make us say"
Shakespeare,"'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd"
Shakespeare,To tire your royalty.
Shakespeare,"We are tougher, brother,"
Shakespeare,Than you can put us to't.
Shakespeare,No longer stay.
Shakespeare,One seven-night longer.
Shakespeare,"Very sooth, to-morrow."
Shakespeare,"We'll part the time between's then, and in that"
Shakespeare,I'll no gainsaying.
Shakespeare,"Press me not, beseech you, so."
Shakespeare,"There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,"
Shakespeare,"So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,"
Shakespeare,"Were there necessity in your request, although"
Shakespeare,'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
Shakespeare,Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
Shakespeare,"Were in your love a whip to me, my stay"
Shakespeare,"To you a charge and trouble: to save both,"
Shakespeare,"Farewell, our brother."
Shakespeare,"Tongue-tied, our queen?"
Shakespeare,speak you.
Shakespeare,"I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until"
Shakespeare,"You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,"
Shakespeare,"Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure"
Shakespeare,"All in Bohemia's well, this satisfaction"
Shakespeare,"The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,"
Shakespeare,He's beat from his best ward.
Shakespeare,"Well said, Hermione."
Shakespeare,"To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:"
Shakespeare,"But let him say so then, and let him go,"
Shakespeare,"But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,"
Shakespeare,We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
Shakespeare,Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
Shakespeare,The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
Shakespeare,"You take my lord, I'll give him my commission"
Shakespeare,To let him there a month behind the gest
Shakespeare,"Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,"
Shakespeare,I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
Shakespeare,What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?
Shakespeare,"Nay, but you will?"
Shakespeare,"I may not, verily."
Shakespeare,Verily!
Shakespeare,"You put me off with limber vows, but I,"
Shakespeare,Though you would seek to unsphere the
Shakespeare,"stars with oaths,"
Shakespeare,"Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,"
Shakespeare,You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
Shakespeare,As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
Shakespeare,"Force me to keep you as a prisoner,"
Shakespeare,"Not like a guest, so you shall pay your fees"
Shakespeare,"When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?"
Shakespeare,"My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'"
Shakespeare,One of them you shall be.
Shakespeare,"Your guest, then, madam:"
Shakespeare,"To be your prisoner should import offending,"
Shakespeare,Which is for me less easy to commit
Shakespeare,Than you to punish.
Shakespeare,"Not your gaoler, then,"
Shakespeare,"But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you"
Shakespeare,Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
Shakespeare,You were pretty lordings then?
Shakespeare,"We were, fair queen,"
Shakespeare,Two lads that thought there was no more behind
Shakespeare,"But such a day to-morrow as to-day,"
Shakespeare,And to be boy eternal.
Shakespeare,Was not my lord
Shakespeare,The verier wag o' the two?
Shakespeare,"We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,"
Shakespeare,And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
Shakespeare,"Was innocence for innocence, we knew not"
Shakespeare,"The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd"
Shakespeare,"That any did. Had we pursued that life,"
Shakespeare,And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
Shakespeare,"With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven"
Shakespeare,"Boldly 'not guilty,' the imposition clear'd"
Shakespeare,Hereditary ours.
Shakespeare,By this we gather
Shakespeare,You have tripp'd since.
Shakespeare,O my most sacred lady!
Shakespeare,"Temptations have since then been born to's, for"
Shakespeare,"In those unfledged days was my wife a girl,"
Shakespeare,Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
Shakespeare,Of my young play-fellow.
Shakespeare,Grace to boot!
Shakespeare,"Of this make no conclusion, lest you say"
Shakespeare,"Your queen and I are devils: yet go on,"
Shakespeare,"The offences we have made you do we'll answer,"
Shakespeare,If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
Shakespeare,You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
Shakespeare,With any but with us.
Shakespeare,Is he won yet?
Shakespeare,He'll stay my lord.
Shakespeare,At my request he would not.
Shakespeare,"Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest"
Shakespeare,To better purpose.
Shakespeare,Never?
Shakespeare,"Never, but once."
Shakespeare,What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
Shakespeare,"I prithee tell me, cram's with praise, and make's"
Shakespeare,As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
Shakespeare,Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
Shakespeare,Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
Shakespeare,With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
Shakespeare,With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
Shakespeare,My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
Shakespeare,"What was my first? it has an elder sister,"
Shakespeare,"Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!"
Shakespeare,But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
Shakespeare,"Nay, let me have't, I long."
Shakespeare,"Why, that was when"
Shakespeare,"Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,"
Shakespeare,Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
Shakespeare,And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
Shakespeare,'I am yours for ever.'
Shakespeare,'Tis grace indeed.
Shakespeare,"Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:"
Shakespeare,"The one for ever earn'd a royal husband,"
Shakespeare,The other for some while a friend.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]	Too hot, too hot!"
Shakespeare,To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
Shakespeare,"I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances,"
Shakespeare,"But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment"
Shakespeare,"May a free face put on, derive a liberty"
Shakespeare,"From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,"
Shakespeare,"And well become the agent, 't may, I grant,"
Shakespeare,"But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,"
Shakespeare,"As now they are, and making practised smiles,"
Shakespeare,"As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere"
Shakespeare,"The mort o' the deer, O, that is entertainment"
Shakespeare,"My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,"
Shakespeare,Art thou my boy?
Shakespeare,I' fecks!
Shakespeare,"Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast"
Shakespeare,smutch'd thy nose?
Shakespeare,"They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,"
Shakespeare,"We must be neat, not neat, but cleanly, captain:"
Shakespeare,"And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf"
Shakespeare,Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
Shakespeare,"Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!"
Shakespeare,Art thou my calf?
Shakespeare,"Yes, if you will, my lord."
Shakespeare,"Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,"
Shakespeare,To be full like me: yet they say we are
Shakespeare,"Almost as like as eggs, women say so,"
Shakespeare,That will say anything but were they false
Shakespeare,"As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false"
Shakespeare,As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
Shakespeare,"No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true"
Shakespeare,"To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,"
Shakespeare,Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
Shakespeare,Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
Shakespeare,Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
Shakespeare,"Thou dost make possible things not so held,"
Shakespeare,"Communicatest with dreams,--how can this be?--"
Shakespeare,"With what's unreal thou coactive art,"
Shakespeare,And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
Shakespeare,"Thou mayst co-join with something, and thou dost,"
Shakespeare,"And that beyond commission, and I find it,"
Shakespeare,And that to the infection of my brains
Shakespeare,And hardening of my brows.
Shakespeare,What means Sicilia?
Shakespeare,He something seems unsettled.
Shakespeare,"How, my lord!"
Shakespeare,"What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?"
Shakespeare,You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
Shakespeare,"Are you moved, my lord?"
Shakespeare,"No, in good earnest."
Shakespeare,"How sometimes nature will betray its folly,"
Shakespeare,"Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime"
Shakespeare,To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
Shakespeare,"Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil"
Shakespeare,"Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,"
Shakespeare,"In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,"
Shakespeare,"Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,"
Shakespeare,"As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:"
Shakespeare,"How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,"
Shakespeare,"This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,"
Shakespeare,Will you take eggs for money?
Shakespeare,"No, my lord, I'll fight."
Shakespeare,"You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,"
Shakespeare,Are you so fond of your young prince as we
Shakespeare,Do seem to be of ours?
Shakespeare,"If at home, sir,"
Shakespeare,"He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,"
Shakespeare,"Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,"
Shakespeare,"My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:"
Shakespeare,"He makes a July's day short as December,"
Shakespeare,And with his varying childness cures in me
Shakespeare,Thoughts that would thick my blood.
Shakespeare,So stands this squire
Shakespeare,"Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,"
Shakespeare,"And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,"
Shakespeare,"How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome,"
Shakespeare,Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
Shakespeare,"Next to thyself and my young rover, he's"
Shakespeare,Apparent to my heart.
Shakespeare,"If you would seek us,"
Shakespeare,We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?
Shakespeare,"To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,"
Shakespeare,Be you beneath the sky.
Shakespeare,"I am angling now,"
Shakespeare,Though you perceive me not how I give line.
Shakespeare,"Go to, go to!"
Shakespeare,"How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!"
Shakespeare,And arms her with the boldness of a wife
Shakespeare,To her allowing husband!
Shakespeare,"Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants"
Shakespeare,Gone already!
Shakespeare,"Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and"
Shakespeare,ears a fork'd one!
Shakespeare,"Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I"
Shakespeare,"Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue"
Shakespeare,Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
Shakespeare,"Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play."
Shakespeare,"There have been,"
Shakespeare,"Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now,"
Shakespeare,"And many a man there is, even at this present,"
Shakespeare,"Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,"
Shakespeare,That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
Shakespeare,"And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by"
Shakespeare,"Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't"
Shakespeare,"Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,"
Shakespeare,"As mine, against their will. Should all despair"
Shakespeare,"That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind"
Shakespeare,"Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none,"
Shakespeare,"It is a bawdy planet, that will strike"
Shakespeare,"Where 'tis predominant, and 'tis powerful, think it,"
Shakespeare,"From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,"
Shakespeare,"No barricado for a belly, know't,"
Shakespeare,It will let in and out the enemy
Shakespeare,With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
Shakespeare,"Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!"
Shakespeare,"I am like you, they say."
Shakespeare,"Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?"
Shakespeare,"Go play, Mamillius, thou'rt an honest man."
Shakespeare,Exit MAMILLIUS
Shakespeare,"Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer."
Shakespeare,You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
Shakespeare,"When you cast out, it still came home."
Shakespeare,Didst note it?
Shakespeare,He would not stay at your petitions: made
Shakespeare,His business more material.
Shakespeare,Didst perceive it?
Shakespeare,"They're here with me already, whispering, rounding"
Shakespeare,"'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,"
Shakespeare,"When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,"
Shakespeare,That he did stay?
Shakespeare,At the good queen's entreaty.
Shakespeare,At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
Shakespeare,"But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken"
Shakespeare,By any understanding pate but thine?
Shakespeare,"For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in"
Shakespeare,"More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,"
Shakespeare,But of the finer natures? by some severals
Shakespeare,Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Shakespeare,Perchance are to this business purblind? say.
Shakespeare,"Business, my lord! I think most understand"
Shakespeare,Bohemia stays here longer.
Shakespeare,Stays here longer.
Shakespeare,"Ay, but why?"
Shakespeare,To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
Shakespeare,Of our most gracious mistress.
Shakespeare,Satisfy!
Shakespeare,The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
Shakespeare,"Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,"
Shakespeare,"With all the nearest things to my heart, as well"
Shakespeare,"My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou"
Shakespeare,"Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed"
Shakespeare,Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
Shakespeare,"Deceived in thy integrity, deceived"
Shakespeare,In that which seems so.
Shakespeare,"Be it forbid, my lord!"
Shakespeare,"To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,"
Shakespeare,"If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,"
Shakespeare,"Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining"
Shakespeare,"From course required, or else thou must be counted"
Shakespeare,A servant grafted in my serious trust
Shakespeare,"And therein negligent, or else a fool"
Shakespeare,"That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,"
Shakespeare,And takest it all for jest.
Shakespeare,"My gracious lord,"
Shakespeare,"I may be negligent, foolish and fearful,"
Shakespeare,"In every one of these no man is free,"
Shakespeare,"But that his negligence, his folly, fear,"
Shakespeare,"Among the infinite doings of the world,"
Shakespeare,"Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,"
Shakespeare,"If ever I were wilful-negligent,"
Shakespeare,"It was my folly, if industriously"
Shakespeare,"I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,"
Shakespeare,"Not weighing well the end, if ever fearful"
Shakespeare,"To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,"
Shakespeare,Where of the execution did cry out
Shakespeare,"Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear"
Shakespeare,"Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,"
Shakespeare,Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
Shakespeare,"Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,"
Shakespeare,"Be plainer with me, let me know my trespass"
Shakespeare,"By its own visage: if I then deny it,"
Shakespeare,'Tis none of mine.
Shakespeare,"Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--"
Shakespeare,"But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass"
Shakespeare,"Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--"
Shakespeare,For to a vision so apparent rumour
Shakespeare,"Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation"
Shakespeare,"Resides not in that man that does not think,--"
Shakespeare,"My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,"
Shakespeare,"Or else be impudently negative,"
Shakespeare,"To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say"
Shakespeare,"My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name"
Shakespeare,As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
Shakespeare,Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.
Shakespeare,I would not be a stander-by to hear
Shakespeare,"My sovereign mistress clouded so, without"
Shakespeare,"My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,"
Shakespeare,You never spoke what did become you less
Shakespeare,"Than this, which to reiterate were sin"
Shakespeare,"As deep as that, though true."
Shakespeare,Is whispering nothing?
Shakespeare,Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
Shakespeare,Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
Shakespeare,Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
Shakespeare,Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
Shakespeare,Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
Shakespeare,"Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes"
Shakespeare,"Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,"
Shakespeare,That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
Shakespeare,"Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing,"
Shakespeare,"The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,"
Shakespeare,"My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,"
Shakespeare,If this be nothing.
Shakespeare,"Good my lord, be cured"
Shakespeare,"Of this diseased opinion, and betimes,"
Shakespeare,For 'tis most dangerous.
Shakespeare,"Say it be, 'tis true."
Shakespeare,"No, no, my lord."
Shakespeare,"It is, you lie, you lie:"
Shakespeare,"I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,"
Shakespeare,"Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,"
Shakespeare,"Or else a hovering temporizer, that"
Shakespeare,"Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,"
Shakespeare,Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
Shakespeare,"Infected as her life, she would not live"
Shakespeare,The running of one glass.
Shakespeare,Who does infect her?
Shakespeare,"Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging"
Shakespeare,"About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I"
Shakespeare,"Had servants true about me, that bare eyes"
Shakespeare,"To see alike mine honour as their profits,"
Shakespeare,"Their own particular thrifts, they would do that"
Shakespeare,"Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,"
Shakespeare,"His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form"
Shakespeare,"Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see"
Shakespeare,"Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,"
Shakespeare,"How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,"
Shakespeare,"To give mine enemy a lasting wink,"
Shakespeare,Which draught to me were cordial.
Shakespeare,"Sir, my lord,"
Shakespeare,"I could do this, and that with no rash potion,"
Shakespeare,But with a lingering dram that should not work
Shakespeare,Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
Shakespeare,"Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,"
Shakespeare,So sovereignly being honourable.
Shakespeare,"I have loved thee,--"
Shakespeare,"Make that thy question, and go rot!"
Shakespeare,"Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,"
Shakespeare,"To appoint myself in this vexation, sully"
Shakespeare,"The purity and whiteness of my sheets,"
Shakespeare,"Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted"
Shakespeare,"Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,"
Shakespeare,"Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,"
Shakespeare,"Who I do think is mine and love as mine,"
Shakespeare,Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
Shakespeare,Could man so blench?
Shakespeare,"I must believe you, sir:"
Shakespeare,"I do, and will fetch off Bohemia for't,"
Shakespeare,"Provided that, when he's removed, your highness"
Shakespeare,"Will take again your queen as yours at first,"
Shakespeare,"Even for your son's sake, and thereby for sealing"
Shakespeare,The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Shakespeare,Known and allied to yours.
Shakespeare,Thou dost advise me
Shakespeare,Even so as I mine own course have set down:
Shakespeare,"I'll give no blemish to her honour, none."
Shakespeare,"Go then, and with a countenance as clear"
Shakespeare,"As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia"
Shakespeare,And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
Shakespeare,"If from me he have wholesome beverage,"
Shakespeare,Account me not your servant.
Shakespeare,This is all:
Shakespeare,"Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart,"
Shakespeare,"Do't not, thou split'st thine own."
Shakespeare,"I'll do't, my lord."
Shakespeare,"I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me."
Shakespeare,"O miserable lady! But, for me,"
Shakespeare,What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
Shakespeare,"Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do't"
Shakespeare,"Is the obedience to a master, one"
Shakespeare,Who in rebellion with himself will have
Shakespeare,"All that are his so too. To do this deed,"
Shakespeare,Promotion follows. If I could find example
Shakespeare,Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
Shakespeare,"And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't, but since"
Shakespeare,"Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,"
Shakespeare,Let villany itself forswear't. I must
Shakespeare,"Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain"
Shakespeare,"To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!"
Shakespeare,Here comes Bohemia.
Shakespeare,Re-enter POLIXENES
Shakespeare,This is strange: methinks
Shakespeare,My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
Shakespeare,"Good day, Camillo."
Shakespeare,"Hail, most royal sir!"
Shakespeare,What is the news i' the court?
Shakespeare,"None rare, my lord."
Shakespeare,The king hath on him such a countenance
Shakespeare,As he had lost some province and a region
Shakespeare,Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
Shakespeare,"With customary compliment, when he,"
Shakespeare,Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
Shakespeare,"A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and"
Shakespeare,So leaves me to consider what is breeding
Shakespeare,That changeth thus his manners.
Shakespeare,"I dare not know, my lord."
Shakespeare,"How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?"
Shakespeare,"Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts,"
Shakespeare,"For, to yourself, what you do know, you must."
Shakespeare,"And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,"
Shakespeare,Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
Shakespeare,"Which shows me mine changed too, for I must be"
Shakespeare,"A party in this alteration, finding"
Shakespeare,Myself thus alter'd with 't.
Shakespeare,There is a sickness
Shakespeare,"Which puts some of us in distemper, but"
Shakespeare,"I cannot name the disease, and it is caught"
Shakespeare,Of you that yet are well.
Shakespeare,How! caught of me!
Shakespeare,Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
Shakespeare,"I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better"
Shakespeare,"By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--"
Shakespeare,"As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto"
Shakespeare,"Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns"
Shakespeare,"Our gentry than our parents' noble names,"
Shakespeare,"In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,"
Shakespeare,If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
Shakespeare,"Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not"
Shakespeare,In ignorant concealment.
Shakespeare,I may not answer.
Shakespeare,"A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!"
Shakespeare,"I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,"
Shakespeare,"I conjure thee, by all the parts of man"
Shakespeare,"Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least"
Shakespeare,"Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare"
Shakespeare,What incidency thou dost guess of harm
Shakespeare,"Is creeping toward me, how far off, how near,"
Shakespeare,"Which way to be prevented, if to be,"
Shakespeare,"If not, how best to bear it."
Shakespeare,"Sir, I will tell you,"
Shakespeare,Since I am charged in honour and by him
Shakespeare,"That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,"
Shakespeare,Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
Shakespeare,"I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me"
Shakespeare,"Cry lost, and so good night!"
Shakespeare,"On, good Camillo."
Shakespeare,I am appointed him to murder you.
Shakespeare,"By whom, Camillo?"
Shakespeare,By the king.
Shakespeare,For what?
Shakespeare,"He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,"
Shakespeare,As he had seen't or been an instrument
Shakespeare,"To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen"
Shakespeare,Forbiddenly.
Shakespeare,"O, then my best blood turn"
Shakespeare,To an infected jelly and my name
Shakespeare,Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
Shakespeare,Turn then my freshest reputation to
Shakespeare,A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
Shakespeare,"Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,"
Shakespeare,"Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection"
Shakespeare,That e'er was heard or read!
Shakespeare,Swear his thought over
Shakespeare,By each particular star in heaven and
Shakespeare,"By all their influences, you may as well"
Shakespeare,Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
Shakespeare,As or by oath remove or counsel shake
Shakespeare,"The fabric of his folly, whose foundation"
Shakespeare,Is piled upon his faith and will continue
Shakespeare,The standing of his body.
Shakespeare,How should this grow?
Shakespeare,I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
Shakespeare,Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
Shakespeare,"If therefore you dare trust my honesty,"
Shakespeare,That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
Shakespeare,"Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!"
Shakespeare,"Your followers I will whisper to the business,"
Shakespeare,And will by twos and threes at several posterns
Shakespeare,"Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put"
Shakespeare,"My fortunes to your service, which are here"
Shakespeare,"By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,"
Shakespeare,"For, by the honour of my parents, I"
Shakespeare,"Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,"
Shakespeare,"I dare not stand by, nor shall you be safer"
Shakespeare,"Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon"
Shakespeare,His execution sworn.
Shakespeare,I do believe thee:
Shakespeare,I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
Shakespeare,Be pilot to me and thy places shall
Shakespeare,Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
Shakespeare,My people did expect my hence departure
Shakespeare,Two days ago. This jealousy
Shakespeare,"Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,"
Shakespeare,"Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,"
Shakespeare,"Must it be violent, and as he does conceive"
Shakespeare,He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
Shakespeare,"Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must"
Shakespeare,In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
Shakespeare,"Good expedition be my friend, and comfort"
Shakespeare,"The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing"
Shakespeare,"Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo,"
Shakespeare,I will respect thee as a father if
Shakespeare,Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
Shakespeare,It is in mine authority to command
Shakespeare,The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
Shakespeare,"To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away."
Shakespeare,SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.
Shakespeare,"Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies"
Shakespeare,"Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,"
Shakespeare,'Tis past enduring.
Shakespeare,"Come, my gracious lord,"
Shakespeare,Shall I be your playfellow?
Shakespeare,"No, I'll none of you."
Shakespeare,"Why, my sweet lord?"
Shakespeare,You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
Shakespeare,I were a baby still. I love you better.
Shakespeare,"And why so, my lord?"
Shakespeare,Not for because
Shakespeare,"Your brows are blacker, yet black brows, they say,"
Shakespeare,"Become some women best, so that there be not"
Shakespeare,"Too much hair there, but in a semicircle"
Shakespeare,Or a half-moon made with a pen.
Shakespeare,Who taught you this?
Shakespeare,I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
Shakespeare,What colour are your eyebrows?
Shakespeare,"Blue, my lord."
Shakespeare,"Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose"
Shakespeare,"That has been blue, but not her eyebrows."
Shakespeare,"Hark ye,"
Shakespeare,The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
Shakespeare,Present our services to a fine new prince
Shakespeare,"One of these days, and then you'ld wanton with us,"
Shakespeare,If we would have you.
Shakespeare,She is spread of late
Shakespeare,Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!
Shakespeare,"What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now"
Shakespeare,"I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,"
Shakespeare,And tell 's a tale.
Shakespeare,Merry or sad shall't be?
Shakespeare,As merry as you will.
Shakespeare,A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
Shakespeare,Of sprites and goblins.
Shakespeare,"Let's have that, good sir."
Shakespeare,"Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best"
Shakespeare,"To fright me with your sprites, you're powerful at it."
Shakespeare,There was a man--
Shakespeare,"Nay, come, sit down, then on."
Shakespeare,"Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly,"
Shakespeare,Yond crickets shall not hear it.
Shakespeare,And give't me in mine ear.
Shakespeare,"Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others"
Shakespeare,Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
Shakespeare,"Behind the tuft of pines I met them, never"
Shakespeare,Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
Shakespeare,Even to their ships.
Shakespeare,How blest am I
Shakespeare,"In my just censure, in my true opinion!"
Shakespeare,"Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed"
Shakespeare,In being so blest! There may be in the cup
Shakespeare,"A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,"
Shakespeare,"And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge"
Shakespeare,Is not infected: but if one present
Shakespeare,"The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known"
Shakespeare,"How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,"
Shakespeare,"With violent hefts. I have drunk,"
Shakespeare,and seen the spider.
Shakespeare,"Camillo was his help in this, his pander:"
Shakespeare,"There is a plot against my life, my crown,"
Shakespeare,All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
Shakespeare,Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
Shakespeare,"He has discover'd my design, and I"
Shakespeare,"Remain a pinch'd thing, yea, a very trick"
Shakespeare,For them to play at will. How came the posterns
Shakespeare,So easily open?
Shakespeare,"By his great authority,"
Shakespeare,Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
Shakespeare,On your command.
Shakespeare,I know't too well.
Shakespeare,Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
Shakespeare,"Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you"
Shakespeare,Have too much blood in him.
Shakespeare,What is this? sport?
Shakespeare,"Bear the boy hence, he shall not come about her,"
Shakespeare,Away with him! and let her sport herself
Shakespeare,"With that she's big with, for 'tis Polixenes"
Shakespeare,Has made thee swell thus.
Shakespeare,"But I'ld say he had not,"
Shakespeare,"And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,"
Shakespeare,Howe'er you lean to the nayward.
Shakespeare,"You, my lords,"
Shakespeare,"Look on her, mark her well, be but about"
Shakespeare,"To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and"
Shakespeare,The justice of your bearts will thereto add
Shakespeare,"'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'"
Shakespeare,"Praise her but for this her without-door form,"
Shakespeare,"Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight"
Shakespeare,"The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands"
Shakespeare,"That calumny doth use--O, I am out--"
Shakespeare,"That mercy does, for calumny will sear"
Shakespeare,"Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,"
Shakespeare,"When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between"
Shakespeare,"Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,"
Shakespeare,"From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,"
Shakespeare,She's an adulteress.
Shakespeare,"Should a villain say so,"
Shakespeare,"The most replenish'd villain in the world,"
Shakespeare,"He were as much more villain: you, my lord,"
Shakespeare,Do but mistake.
Shakespeare,"You have mistook, my lady,"
Shakespeare,Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
Shakespeare,"Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,"
Shakespeare,"Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,"
Shakespeare,Should a like language use to all degrees
Shakespeare,And mannerly distinguishment leave out
Shakespeare,Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
Shakespeare,"She's an adulteress, I have said with whom:"
Shakespeare,"More, she's a traitor and Camillo is"
Shakespeare,"A federary with her, and one that knows"
Shakespeare,What she should shame to know herself
Shakespeare,"But with her most vile principal, that she's"
Shakespeare,"A bed-swerver, even as bad as those"
Shakespeare,"That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy"
Shakespeare,To this their late escape.
Shakespeare,"No, by my life."
Shakespeare,"Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,"
Shakespeare,"When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that"
Shakespeare,"You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,"
Shakespeare,You scarce can right me throughly then to say
Shakespeare,You did mistake.
Shakespeare,"No, if I mistake"
Shakespeare,"In those foundations which I build upon,"
Shakespeare,The centre is not big enough to bear
Shakespeare,A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
Shakespeare,He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
Shakespeare,But that he speaks.
Shakespeare,There's some ill planet reigns:
Shakespeare,I must be patient till the heavens look
Shakespeare,"With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,"
Shakespeare,"I am not prone to weeping, as our sex"
Shakespeare,"Commonly are, the want of which vain dew"
Shakespeare,Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
Shakespeare,That honourable grief lodged here which burns
Shakespeare,"Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,"
Shakespeare,With thoughts so qualified as your charities
Shakespeare,"Shall best instruct you, measure me, and so"
Shakespeare,The king's will be perform'd!
Shakespeare,Shall I be heard?
Shakespeare,"Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,"
Shakespeare,"My women may be with me, for you see"
Shakespeare,"My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools,"
Shakespeare,There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
Shakespeare,"Has deserved prison, then abound in tears"
Shakespeare,As I come out: this action I now go on
Shakespeare,"Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:"
Shakespeare,"I never wish'd to see you sorry, now"
Shakespeare,"I trust I shall. My women, come, you have leave."
Shakespeare,"Go, do our bidding, hence!"
Shakespeare,"Exit HERMIONE, guarded, with Ladies"
Shakespeare,"Beseech your highness, call the queen again."
Shakespeare,"Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice"
Shakespeare,"Prove violence, in the which three great ones suffer,"
Shakespeare,"Yourself, your queen, your son."
Shakespeare,"For her, my lord,"
Shakespeare,"I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,"
Shakespeare,"Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless"
Shakespeare,"I' the eyes of heaven and to you, I mean,"
Shakespeare,In this which you accuse her.
Shakespeare,If it prove
Shakespeare,"She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where"
Shakespeare,"I lodge my wife, I'll go in couples with her,"
Shakespeare,"Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her,"
Shakespeare,"For every inch of woman in the world,"
Shakespeare,"Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be."
Shakespeare,Hold your peaces.
Shakespeare,"It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:"
Shakespeare,You are abused and by some putter-on
Shakespeare,"That will be damn'd for't, would I knew the villain,"
Shakespeare,"I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,"
Shakespeare,"I have three daughters, the eldest is eleven"
Shakespeare,"The second and the third, nine, and some five,"
Shakespeare,"If this prove true, they'll pay for't:"
Shakespeare,"by mine honour,"
Shakespeare,"I'll geld 'em all, fourteen they shall not see,"
Shakespeare,"To bring false generations: they are co-heirs,"
Shakespeare,And I had rather glib myself than they
Shakespeare,Should not produce fair issue.
Shakespeare,"Cease, no more."
Shakespeare,You smell this business with a sense as cold
Shakespeare,As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
Shakespeare,"As you feel doing thus, and see withal"
Shakespeare,The instruments that feel.
Shakespeare,"If it be so,"
Shakespeare,We need no grave to bury honesty:
Shakespeare,There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Shakespeare,Of the whole dungy earth.
Shakespeare,What! lack I credit?
Shakespeare,"I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,"
Shakespeare,"Upon this ground, and more it would content me"
Shakespeare,"To have her honour true than your suspicion,"
Shakespeare,Be blamed for't how you might.
Shakespeare,"Why, what need we"
Shakespeare,"Commune with you of this, but rather follow"
Shakespeare,Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
Shakespeare,"Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness"
Shakespeare,"Imparts this, which if you, or stupefied"
Shakespeare,"Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not"
Shakespeare,"Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves"
Shakespeare,"We need no more of your advice: the matter,"
Shakespeare,"The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all"
Shakespeare,Properly ours.
Shakespeare,"And I wish, my liege,"
Shakespeare,"You had only in your silent judgment tried it,"
Shakespeare,Without more overture.
Shakespeare,How could that be?
Shakespeare,"Either thou art most ignorant by age,"
Shakespeare,"Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,"
Shakespeare,"Added to their familiarity,"
Shakespeare,"Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,"
Shakespeare,"That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation"
Shakespeare,"But only seeing, all other circumstances"
Shakespeare,"Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:"
Shakespeare,"Yet, for a greater confirmation,"
Shakespeare,For in an act of this importance 'twere
Shakespeare,"Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post"
Shakespeare,"To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,"
Shakespeare,"Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know"
Shakespeare,Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
Shakespeare,"They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had,"
Shakespeare,Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
Shakespeare,"Well done, my lord."
Shakespeare,Though I am satisfied and need no more
Shakespeare,"Than what I know, yet shall the oracle"
Shakespeare,"Give rest to the minds of others, such as he"
Shakespeare,Whose ignorant credulity will not
Shakespeare,Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
Shakespeare,"From our free person she should be confined,"
Shakespeare,Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
Shakespeare,"Be left her to perform. Come, follow us,"
Shakespeare,"We are to speak in public, for this business"
Shakespeare,Will raise us all.
Shakespeare,"To laughter, as I take it,"
Shakespeare,If the good truth were known.
Shakespeare,"Enter PAULINA, a Gentleman, and Attendants"
Shakespeare,"The keeper of the prison, call to him,"
Shakespeare,let him have knowledge who I am.
Shakespeare,"No court in Europe is too good for thee,"
Shakespeare,What dost thou then in prison?
Shakespeare,"Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler"
Shakespeare,"Now, good sir,"
Shakespeare,For a worthy lady
Shakespeare,And one whom much I honour.
Shakespeare,"Pray you then,"
Shakespeare,Conduct me to the queen.
Shakespeare,To the contrary I have express commandment.
Shakespeare,"Here's ado,"
Shakespeare,To lock up honesty and honour from
Shakespeare,The access of gentle visitors!
Shakespeare,"Is't lawful, pray you,"
Shakespeare,To see her women? any of them? Emilia?
Shakespeare,"So please you, madam,"
Shakespeare,"To put apart these your attendants, I"
Shakespeare,Shall bring Emilia forth.
Shakespeare,"I pray now, call her."
Shakespeare,Withdraw yourselves.
Shakespeare,Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants
Shakespeare,"And, madam,"
Shakespeare,I must be present at your conference.
Shakespeare,"Well, be't so, prithee."
Shakespeare,Exit Gaoler
Shakespeare,Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
Shakespeare,As passes colouring.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA"
Shakespeare,"Dear gentlewoman,"
Shakespeare,How fares our gracious lady?
Shakespeare,As well as one so great and so forlorn
Shakespeare,"May hold together: on her frights and griefs,"
Shakespeare,"Which never tender lady hath born greater,"
Shakespeare,She is something before her time deliver'd.
Shakespeare,A boy?
Shakespeare,"A daughter, and a goodly babe,"
Shakespeare,Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
Shakespeare,"Much comfort in't, says 'My poor prisoner,"
Shakespeare,I am innocent as you.'
Shakespeare,I dare be sworn
Shakespeare,"These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,"
Shakespeare,beshrew them!
Shakespeare,"He must be told on't, and he shall: the office"
Shakespeare,"Becomes a woman best, I'll take't upon me:"
Shakespeare,If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
Shakespeare,And never to my red-look'd anger be
Shakespeare,"The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,"
Shakespeare,Commend my best obedience to the queen:
Shakespeare,"If she dares trust me with her little babe,"
Shakespeare,I'll show't the king and undertake to be
Shakespeare,Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
Shakespeare,How he may soften at the sight o' the child:
Shakespeare,The silence often of pure innocence
Shakespeare,Persuades when speaking fails.
Shakespeare,"Most worthy madam,"
Shakespeare,Your honour and your goodness is so evident
Shakespeare,That your free undertaking cannot miss
Shakespeare,A thriving issue: there is no lady living
Shakespeare,So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
Shakespeare,"To visit the next room, I'll presently"
Shakespeare,"Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer,"
Shakespeare,"Who  but to-day hammer'd of this design,"
Shakespeare,"But durst not tempt a minister of honour,"
Shakespeare,Lest she should be denied.
Shakespeare,"Tell her, Emilia."
Shakespeare,I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
Shakespeare,"As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted"
Shakespeare,I shall do good.
Shakespeare,Now be you blest for it!
Shakespeare,"I'll to the queen: please you,"
Shakespeare,come something nearer.
Shakespeare,"Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,"
Shakespeare,"I know not what I shall incur to pass it,"
Shakespeare,Having no warrant.
Shakespeare,"You need not fear it, sir:"
Shakespeare,This child was prisoner to the womb and is
Shakespeare,By law and process of great nature thence
Shakespeare,"Freed and enfranchised, not a party to"
Shakespeare,"The anger of the king nor guilty of,"
Shakespeare,"If any be, the trespass of the queen."
Shakespeare,I do believe it.
Shakespeare,"Do not you fear: upon mine honour,"
Shakespeare,I will stand betwixt you and danger.
Shakespeare,SCENE III. A room in LEONTES' palace.
Shakespeare,"Enter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants"
Shakespeare,Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
Shakespeare,"To bear the matter thus, mere weakness. If"
Shakespeare,"The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,"
Shakespeare,"She the adulteress, for the harlot king"
Shakespeare,"Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank"
Shakespeare,"And level of my brain, plot-proof, but she"
Shakespeare,"I can hook to me: say that she were gone,"
Shakespeare,"Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest"
Shakespeare,Might come to me again. Who's there?
Shakespeare,How does the boy?
Shakespeare,"He took good rest to-night,"
Shakespeare,'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
Shakespeare,To see his nobleness!
Shakespeare,"Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,"
Shakespeare,"He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,"
Shakespeare,"Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,"
Shakespeare,"Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,"
Shakespeare,"And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,"
Shakespeare,See how he fares.
Shakespeare,"Fie, fie! no thought of him:"
Shakespeare,The thought of my revenges that way
Shakespeare,"Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,"
Shakespeare,"And in his parties, his alliance, let him be"
Shakespeare,"Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,"
Shakespeare,Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
Shakespeare,"Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:"
Shakespeare,"They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor"
Shakespeare,Shall she within my power.
Shakespeare,"Enter PAULINA, with a child"
Shakespeare,You must not enter.
Shakespeare,"Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:"
Shakespeare,"Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,"
Shakespeare,"Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,"
Shakespeare,More free than he is jealous.
Shakespeare,That's enough.
Shakespeare,"Madam, he hath not slept tonight, commanded"
Shakespeare,None should come at him.
Shakespeare,"Not so hot, good sir:"
Shakespeare,"I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,"
Shakespeare,That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
Shakespeare,"At each his needless heavings, such as you"
Shakespeare,Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
Shakespeare,"Do come with words as medicinal as true,"
Shakespeare,"Honest as either, to purge him of that humour"
Shakespeare,That presses him from sleep.
Shakespeare,"What noise there, ho?"
Shakespeare,"No noise, my lord, but needful conference"
Shakespeare,About some gossips for your highness.
Shakespeare,"Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,"
Shakespeare,I charged thee that she should not come about me:
Shakespeare,I knew she would.
Shakespeare,"I told her so, my lord,"
Shakespeare,"On your displeasure's peril and on mine,"
Shakespeare,She should not visit you.
Shakespeare,"What, canst not rule her?"
Shakespeare,"From all dishonesty he can: in this,"
Shakespeare,"Unless he take the course that you have done,"
Shakespeare,"Commit me for committing honour, trust it,"
Shakespeare,He shall not rule me.
Shakespeare,"La you now, you hear:"
Shakespeare,"When she will take the rein I let her run,"
Shakespeare,But she'll not stumble.
Shakespeare,"Good my liege, I come,"
Shakespeare,"And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess"
Shakespeare,"Myself your loyal servant, your physician,"
Shakespeare,"Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare"
Shakespeare,"Less appear so in comforting your evils,"
Shakespeare,"Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come"
Shakespeare,From your good queen.
Shakespeare,Good queen!
Shakespeare,"Good queen, my lord,"
Shakespeare,"Good queen, I say good queen,"
Shakespeare,"And would by combat make her good, so were I"
Shakespeare,"A man, the worst about you."
Shakespeare,Force her hence.
Shakespeare,Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
Shakespeare,"First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off,"
Shakespeare,"But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,"
Shakespeare,"For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter,"
Shakespeare,"Here 'tis, commends it to your blessing."
Shakespeare,Laying down the child
Shakespeare,Out!
Shakespeare,"A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:"
Shakespeare,A most intelligencing bawd!
Shakespeare,Not so:
Shakespeare,I am as ignorant in that as you
Shakespeare,"In so entitling me, and no less honest"
Shakespeare,"Than you are mad, which is enough, I'll warrant,"
Shakespeare,"As this world goes, to pass for honest."
Shakespeare,Traitors!
Shakespeare,Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
Shakespeare,"Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted"
Shakespeare,"By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard,"
Shakespeare,"Take't up, I say, give't to thy crone."
Shakespeare,For ever
Shakespeare,"Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou"
Shakespeare,Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
Shakespeare,Which he has put upon't!
Shakespeare,He dreads his wife.
Shakespeare,"So I would you did, then 'twere past all doubt"
Shakespeare,You'ld call your children yours.
Shakespeare,A nest of traitors!
Shakespeare,"I am none, by this good light."
Shakespeare,"Nor I, nor any"
Shakespeare,"But one that's here, and that's himself, for he"
Shakespeare,"The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,"
Shakespeare,"His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,"
Shakespeare,"Whose sting is sharper than the sword's,"
Shakespeare,and will not--
Shakespeare,"For, as the case now stands, it is a curse"
Shakespeare,He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
Shakespeare,"The root of his opinion, which is rotten"
Shakespeare,As ever oak or stone was sound.
Shakespeare,A callat
Shakespeare,"Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband"
Shakespeare,"And now baits me! This brat is none of mine,"
Shakespeare,It is the issue of Polixenes:
Shakespeare,"Hence with it, and together with the dam"
Shakespeare,Commit them to the fire!
Shakespeare,"It is yours,"
Shakespeare,"And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,"
Shakespeare,"So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,"
Shakespeare,"Although the print be little, the whole matter"
Shakespeare,"And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,"
Shakespeare,"The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,"
Shakespeare,"The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,"
Shakespeare,"His smiles,"
Shakespeare,"The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:"
Shakespeare,"And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it"
Shakespeare,"So like to him that got it, if thou hast"
Shakespeare,"The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours"
Shakespeare,"No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,"
Shakespeare,Her children not her husband's!
Shakespeare,A gross hag
Shakespeare,"And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,"
Shakespeare,That wilt not stay her tongue.
Shakespeare,Hang all the husbands
Shakespeare,"That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself"
Shakespeare,Hardly one subject.
Shakespeare,"Once more, take her hence."
Shakespeare,A most unworthy and unnatural lord
Shakespeare,Can do no more.
Shakespeare,I'll ha' thee burnt.
Shakespeare,I care not:
Shakespeare,"It is an heretic that makes the fire,"
Shakespeare,"Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant,"
Shakespeare,"But this most cruel usage of your queen,"
Shakespeare,Not able to produce more accusation
Shakespeare,"Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours"
Shakespeare,"Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,"
Shakespeare,"Yea, scandalous to the world."
Shakespeare,"On your allegiance,"
Shakespeare,"Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,"
Shakespeare,"Where were her life? she durst not call me so,"
Shakespeare,If she did know me one. Away with her!
Shakespeare,"I pray you, do not push me, I'll be gone."
Shakespeare,"Look to your babe, my lord, 'tis yours:"
Shakespeare,Jove send her
Shakespeare,A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
Shakespeare,"You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,"
Shakespeare,"Will never do him good, not one of you."
Shakespeare,"So, so: farewell, we are gone."
Shakespeare,"Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this."
Shakespeare,"My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast"
Shakespeare,"A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence"
Shakespeare,"And see it instantly consumed with fire,"
Shakespeare,Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
Shakespeare,"Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,"
Shakespeare,"And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,"
Shakespeare,With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
Shakespeare,"And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so,"
Shakespeare,The bastard brains with these my proper hands
Shakespeare,"Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire,"
Shakespeare,For thou set'st on thy wife.
Shakespeare,"I did not, sir:"
Shakespeare,"These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,"
Shakespeare,Can clear me in't.
Shakespeare,"We can: my royal liege,"
Shakespeare,He is not guilty of her coming hither.
Shakespeare,You're liars all.
Shakespeare,"Beseech your highness, give us better credit:"
Shakespeare,"We have always truly served you, and beseech you"
Shakespeare,"So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,"
Shakespeare,As recompense of our dear services
Shakespeare,"Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,"
Shakespeare,"Which being so horrible, so bloody, must"
Shakespeare,Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
Shakespeare,I am a feather for each wind that blows:
Shakespeare,Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
Shakespeare,And call me father? better burn it now
Shakespeare,"Than curse it then. But be it, let it live."
Shakespeare,"It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither,"
Shakespeare,You that have been so tenderly officious
Shakespeare,"With Lady Margery, your midwife there,"
Shakespeare,"To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,"
Shakespeare,"So sure as this beard's grey,"
Shakespeare,--what will you adventure
Shakespeare,To save this brat's life?
Shakespeare,"Any thing, my lord,"
Shakespeare,That my ability may undergo
Shakespeare,And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
Shakespeare,I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
Shakespeare,To save the innocent: any thing possible.
Shakespeare,It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
Shakespeare,Thou wilt perform my bidding.
Shakespeare,"Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail"
Shakespeare,Of any point in't shall not only be
Shakespeare,"Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,"
Shakespeare,"Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,"
Shakespeare,"As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry"
Shakespeare,This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
Shakespeare,To some remote and desert place quite out
Shakespeare,"Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,"
Shakespeare,"Without more mercy, to its own protection"
Shakespeare,And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
Shakespeare,"It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,"
Shakespeare,"On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,"
Shakespeare,That thou commend it strangely to some place
Shakespeare,Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
Shakespeare,"I swear to do this, though a present death"
Shakespeare,"Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:"
Shakespeare,Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
Shakespeare,"To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say"
Shakespeare,Casting their savageness aside have done
Shakespeare,"Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous"
Shakespeare,In more than this deed does require! And blessing
Shakespeare,"Against this cruelty fight on thy side,"
Shakespeare,"Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!"
Shakespeare,Exit with the child
Shakespeare,"No, I'll not rear"
Shakespeare,Another's issue.
Shakespeare,"Please your highness, posts"
Shakespeare,From those you sent to the oracle are come
Shakespeare,"An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,"
Shakespeare,"Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,"
Shakespeare,Hasting to the court.
Shakespeare,"So please you, sir, their speed"
Shakespeare,Hath been beyond account.
Shakespeare,Twenty-three days
Shakespeare,"They have been absent: 'tis good speed, foretells"
Shakespeare,The great Apollo suddenly will have
Shakespeare,"The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords,"
Shakespeare,"Summon a session, that we may arraign"
Shakespeare,"Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath"
Shakespeare,"Been publicly accused, so shall she have"
Shakespeare,A just and open trial. While she lives
Shakespeare,"My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,"
Shakespeare,And think upon my bidding.
Shakespeare,SCENE I. A sea-port in Sicilia.
Shakespeare,Enter CLEOMENES and DION
Shakespeare,"The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,"
Shakespeare,"Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing"
Shakespeare,The common praise it bears.
Shakespeare,"I shall report,"
Shakespeare,"For most it caught me, the celestial habits,"
Shakespeare,"Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence"
Shakespeare,"Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!"
Shakespeare,"How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly"
Shakespeare,It was i' the offering!
Shakespeare,"But of all, the burst"
Shakespeare,"And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,"
Shakespeare,"Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense."
Shakespeare,That I was nothing.
Shakespeare,If the event o' the journey
Shakespeare,"Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--"
Shakespeare,"As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,"
Shakespeare,The time is worth the use on't.
Shakespeare,Great Apollo
Shakespeare,"Turn all to the best! These proclamations,"
Shakespeare,"So forcing faults upon Hermione,"
Shakespeare,I little like.
Shakespeare,The violent carriage of it
Shakespeare,"Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,"
Shakespeare,"Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,"
Shakespeare,"Shall the contents discover, something rare"
Shakespeare,Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
Shakespeare,And gracious be the issue!
Shakespeare,SCENE II. A court of Justice.
Shakespeare,"Enter LEONTES, Lords, and Officers"
Shakespeare,"This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,"
Shakespeare,Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
Shakespeare,"The daughter of a king, our wife, and one"
Shakespeare,Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
Shakespeare,"Of being tyrannous, since we so openly"
Shakespeare,"Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,"
Shakespeare,Even to the guilt or the purgation.
Shakespeare,Produce the prisoner.
Shakespeare,It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
Shakespeare,Appear in person here in court. Silence!
Shakespeare,"Enter HERMIONE guarded, PAULINA and Ladies attending"
Shakespeare,Read the indictment.
Shakespeare,"[Reads]            Hermione, queen to the worthy"
Shakespeare,"Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and"
Shakespeare,"arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery"
Shakespeare,"with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring"
Shakespeare,with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
Shakespeare,"lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence"
Shakespeare,"whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,"
Shakespeare,"thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance"
Shakespeare,"of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for"
Shakespeare,"their better safety, to fly away by night."
Shakespeare,Since what I am to say must be but that
Shakespeare,Which contradicts my accusation and
Shakespeare,The testimony on my part no other
Shakespeare,"But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me"
Shakespeare,To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
Shakespeare,"Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,"
Shakespeare,Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
Shakespeare,"Behold our human actions, as they do,"
Shakespeare,I doubt not then but innocence shall make
Shakespeare,False accusation blush and tyranny
Shakespeare,"Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,"
Shakespeare,"Who least will seem to do so, my past life"
Shakespeare,"Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,"
Shakespeare,"As I am now unhappy, which is more"
Shakespeare,"Than history can pattern, though devised"
Shakespeare,And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
Shakespeare,"A fellow of the royal bed, which owe"
Shakespeare,"A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,"
Shakespeare,"The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing"
Shakespeare,To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
Shakespeare,"Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it"
Shakespeare,"As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,"
Shakespeare,"'Tis a derivative from me to mine,"
Shakespeare,And only that I stand for. I appeal
Shakespeare,"To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes"
Shakespeare,"Came to your court, how I was in your grace,"
Shakespeare,"How merited to be so, since he came,"
Shakespeare,With what encounter so uncurrent I
Shakespeare,Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
Shakespeare,"The bound of honour, or in act or will"
Shakespeare,"That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts"
Shakespeare,"Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin"
Shakespeare,Cry fie upon my grave!
Shakespeare,I ne'er heard yet
Shakespeare,That any of these bolder vices wanted
Shakespeare,Less impudence to gainsay what they did
Shakespeare,Than to perform it first.
Shakespeare,"That's true enough,"
Shakespeare,"Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me."
Shakespeare,You will not own it.
Shakespeare,More than mistress of
Shakespeare,"Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not"
Shakespeare,"At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,"
Shakespeare,"With whom I am accused, I do confess"
Shakespeare,"I loved him as in honour he required,"
Shakespeare,With such a kind of love as might become
Shakespeare,"A lady like me, with a love even such,"
Shakespeare,"So and no other, as yourself commanded:"
Shakespeare,Which not to have done I think had been in me
Shakespeare,Both disobedience and ingratitude
Shakespeare,"To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,"
Shakespeare,"Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely"
Shakespeare,"That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,"
Shakespeare,"I know not how it tastes, though it be dish'd"
Shakespeare,For me to try how: all I know of it
Shakespeare,"Is that Camillo was an honest man,"
Shakespeare,"And why he left your court, the gods themselves,"
Shakespeare,"Wotting no more than I, are ignorant."
Shakespeare,"You knew of his departure, as you know"
Shakespeare,What you have underta'en to do in's absence.
Shakespeare,You speak a language that I understand not:
Shakespeare,"My life stands in the level of your dreams,"
Shakespeare,Which I'll lay down.
Shakespeare,"Your actions are my dreams,"
Shakespeare,"You had a bastard by Polixenes,"
Shakespeare,"And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--"
Shakespeare,Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
Shakespeare,"Which to deny concerns more than avails, for as"
Shakespeare,"Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,"
Shakespeare,"No father owning it,--which is, indeed,"
Shakespeare,"More criminal in thee than it,--so thou"
Shakespeare,"Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage"
Shakespeare,Look for no less than death.
Shakespeare,"Sir, spare your threats:"
Shakespeare,The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
Shakespeare,To me can life be no commodity:
Shakespeare,"The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,"
Shakespeare,"I do give lost, for I do feel it gone,"
Shakespeare,But know not how it went. My second joy
Shakespeare,"And first-fruits of my body, from his presence"
Shakespeare,"I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort"
Shakespeare,"Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,"
Shakespeare,"The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,"
Shakespeare,Haled out to murder: myself on every post
Shakespeare,Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
Shakespeare,"The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs"
Shakespeare,"To women of all fashion, lastly, hurried"
Shakespeare,"Here to this place, i' the open air, before"
Shakespeare,"I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,"
Shakespeare,"Tell me what blessings I have here alive,"
Shakespeare,That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
Shakespeare,"But yet hear this: mistake me not, no life,"
Shakespeare,"I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,"
Shakespeare,"Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd"
Shakespeare,"Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else"
Shakespeare,"But what your jealousies awake, I tell you"
Shakespeare,"'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,"
Shakespeare,I do refer me to the oracle:
Shakespeare,Apollo be my judge!
Shakespeare,This your request
Shakespeare,"Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,"
Shakespeare,"And in Apollos name, his oracle."
Shakespeare,Exeunt certain Officers
Shakespeare,The Emperor of Russia was my father:
Shakespeare,"O that he were alive, and here beholding"
Shakespeare,His daughter's trial! that he did but see
Shakespeare,"The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes"
Shakespeare,"Of pity, not revenge!"
Shakespeare,"Re-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DION"
Shakespeare,"You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,"
Shakespeare,"That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have"
Shakespeare,"Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought"
Shakespeare,"The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd"
Shakespeare,"Of great Apollo's priest, and that, since then,"
Shakespeare,You have not dared to break the holy seal
Shakespeare,Nor read the secrets in't.
Shakespeare,All this we swear.
Shakespeare,Break up the seals and read.
Shakespeare,"[Reads]	Hermione is chaste,"
Shakespeare,"Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true subject, Leontes"
Shakespeare,"a jealous tyrant, his innocent babe truly begotten,"
Shakespeare,"and the king shall live without an heir, if that"
Shakespeare,which is lost be not found.
Shakespeare,Now blessed be the great Apollo!
Shakespeare,Praised!
Shakespeare,Hast thou read truth?
Shakespeare,"Ay, my lord, even so"
Shakespeare,As it is here set down.
Shakespeare,There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
Shakespeare,The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.
Shakespeare,"My lord the king, the king!"
Shakespeare,What is the business?
Shakespeare,"O sir, I shall be hated to report it!"
Shakespeare,"The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear"
Shakespeare,"Of the queen's speed, is gone."
Shakespeare,How! gone!
Shakespeare,Is dead.
Shakespeare,"Apollo's angry, and the heavens themselves"
Shakespeare,Do strike at my injustice.
Shakespeare,HERMIONE swoons
Shakespeare,How now there!
Shakespeare,This news is mortal to the queen: look down
Shakespeare,And see what death is doing.
Shakespeare,Take her hence:
Shakespeare,"Her heart is but o'ercharged, she will recover:"
Shakespeare,I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
Shakespeare,"Beseech you, tenderly apply to her"
Shakespeare,Some remedies for life.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies, with HERMIONE"
Shakespeare,"Apollo, pardon"
Shakespeare,My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
Shakespeare,"I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,"
Shakespeare,"New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,"
Shakespeare,"Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy,"
Shakespeare,"For, being transported by my jealousies"
Shakespeare,"To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose"
Shakespeare,Camillo for the minister to poison
Shakespeare,"My friend Polixenes: which had been done,"
Shakespeare,But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
Shakespeare,"My swift command, though I with death and with"
Shakespeare,"Reward did threaten and encourage him,"
Shakespeare,"Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane"
Shakespeare,"And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest"
Shakespeare,"Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,"
Shakespeare,"Which you knew great, and to the hazard"
Shakespeare,"Of all encertainties himself commended,"
Shakespeare,No richer than his honour: how he glisters
Shakespeare,Thorough my rust! and how his pity
Shakespeare,Does my deeds make the blacker!
Shakespeare,Re-enter PAULINA
Shakespeare,Woe the while!
Shakespeare,"O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,"
Shakespeare,Break too.
Shakespeare,"What fit is this, good lady?"
Shakespeare,"What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?"
Shakespeare,What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
Shakespeare,In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
Shakespeare,"Must I receive, whose every word deserves"
Shakespeare,To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
Shakespeare,"Together working with thy jealousies,"
Shakespeare,"Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle"
Shakespeare,"For girls of nine, O, think what they have done"
Shakespeare,"And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all"
Shakespeare,Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
Shakespeare,"That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing,"
Shakespeare,"That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant"
Shakespeare,"And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,"
Shakespeare,"Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,"
Shakespeare,"To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,"
Shakespeare,More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
Shakespeare,The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
Shakespeare,"To be or none or little, though a devil"
Shakespeare,Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
Shakespeare,"Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death"
Shakespeare,"Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,"
Shakespeare,"Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart"
Shakespeare,That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
Shakespeare,"Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,"
Shakespeare,"Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,"
Shakespeare,"When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,"
Shakespeare,"The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,"
Shakespeare,and vengeance for't
Shakespeare,Not dropp'd down yet.
Shakespeare,The higher powers forbid!
Shakespeare,"I say she's dead, I'll swear't. If word nor oath"
Shakespeare,"Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring"
Shakespeare,"Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,"
Shakespeare,"Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you"
Shakespeare,"As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!"
Shakespeare,"Do not repent these things, for they are heavier"
Shakespeare,"Than all thy woes can stir, therefore betake thee"
Shakespeare,To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
Shakespeare,"Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,"
Shakespeare,Upon a barren mountain and still winter
Shakespeare,"In storm perpetual, could not move the gods"
Shakespeare,To look that way thou wert.
Shakespeare,"Go on, go on"
Shakespeare,"Thou canst not speak too much, I have deserved"
Shakespeare,All tongues to talk their bitterest.
Shakespeare,"Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault"
Shakespeare,I' the boldness of your speech.
Shakespeare,I am sorry for't:
Shakespeare,"All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,"
Shakespeare,I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
Shakespeare,The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
Shakespeare,To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
Shakespeare,Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
Shakespeare,"At my petition, I beseech you, rather"
Shakespeare,"Let me be punish'd, that have minded you"
Shakespeare,"Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege"
Shakespeare,"Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:"
Shakespeare,"The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--"
Shakespeare,"I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children,"
Shakespeare,"I'll not remember you of my own lord,"
Shakespeare,"Who is lost too: take your patience to you,"
Shakespeare,And I'll say nothing.
Shakespeare,Thou didst speak but well
Shakespeare,"When most the truth, which I receive much better"
Shakespeare,"Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me"
Shakespeare,To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
Shakespeare,One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
Shakespeare,"The causes of their death appear, unto"
Shakespeare,Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
Shakespeare,"The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there"
Shakespeare,Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
Shakespeare,"Will bear up with this exercise, so long"
Shakespeare,I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
Shakespeare,Unto these sorrows.
Shakespeare,SCENE III. Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.
Shakespeare,"Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child, and a Mariner"
Shakespeare,"Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon"
Shakespeare,The deserts of Bohemia?
Shakespeare,"Ay, my lord: and fear"
Shakespeare,We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
Shakespeare,"And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,"
Shakespeare,The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
Shakespeare,And frown upon 's.
Shakespeare,"Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard,"
Shakespeare,Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
Shakespeare,I call upon thee.
Shakespeare,"Make your best haste, and go not"
Shakespeare,"Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather,"
Shakespeare,"Besides, this place is famous for the creatures"
Shakespeare,Of prey that keep upon't.
Shakespeare,Go thou away:
Shakespeare,I'll follow instantly.
Shakespeare,I am glad at heart
Shakespeare,To be so rid o' the business.
Shakespeare,"Come, poor babe:"
Shakespeare,"I have heard, but not believed,"
Shakespeare,the spirits o' the dead
Shakespeare,"May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother"
Shakespeare,"Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream"
Shakespeare,"So like a waking. To me comes a creature,"
Shakespeare,"Sometimes her head on one side, some another,"
Shakespeare,"I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,"
Shakespeare,"So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,"
Shakespeare,"Like very sanctity, she did approach"
Shakespeare,"My cabin where I lay, thrice bow'd before me,"
Shakespeare,"And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes"
Shakespeare,"Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon"
Shakespeare,"Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,"
Shakespeare,"Since fate, against thy better disposition,"
Shakespeare,Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
Shakespeare,"Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,"
Shakespeare,"Places remote enough are in Bohemia,"
Shakespeare,"There weep and leave it crying, and, for the babe"
Shakespeare,"Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,"
Shakespeare,"I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business"
Shakespeare,"Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see"
Shakespeare,"Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks"
Shakespeare,"She melted into air. Affrighted much,"
Shakespeare,I did in time collect myself and thought
Shakespeare,This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
Shakespeare,"Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,"
Shakespeare,I will be squared by this. I do believe
Shakespeare,"Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that"
Shakespeare,"Apollo would, this being indeed the issue"
Shakespeare,"Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,"
Shakespeare,"Either for life or death, upon the earth"
Shakespeare,"Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!"
Shakespeare,"There lie, and there thy character: there these,"
Shakespeare,"Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,"
Shakespeare,"And still rest thine. The storm begins, poor wretch,"
Shakespeare,That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
Shakespeare,"To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,"
Shakespeare,"But my heart bleeds, and most accursed am I"
Shakespeare,To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
Shakespeare,The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
Shakespeare,A lullaby too rough: I never saw
Shakespeare,The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
Shakespeare,Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
Shakespeare,I am gone for ever.
Shakespeare,"Exit, pursued by a bear"
Shakespeare,Enter a Shepherd
Shakespeare,I would there were no age between sixteen and
Shakespeare,"three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the"
Shakespeare,"rest, for there is nothing in the between but"
Shakespeare,"getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,"
Shakespeare,"stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but"
Shakespeare,these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
Shakespeare,hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
Shakespeare,"best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find"
Shakespeare,"than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by"
Shakespeare,"the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy"
Shakespeare,"will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very"
Shakespeare,"pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A"
Shakespeare,"pretty one, a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:"
Shakespeare,"though I am not bookish, yet I can read"
Shakespeare,waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
Shakespeare,"some stair-work, some trunk-work, some"
Shakespeare,behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
Shakespeare,than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
Shakespeare,"pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come, he hallooed"
Shakespeare,"but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!"
Shakespeare,"Hilloa, loa!"
Shakespeare,"What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk"
Shakespeare,"on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What"
Shakespeare,"ailest thou, man?"
Shakespeare,"I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!"
Shakespeare,"but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the"
Shakespeare,sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
Shakespeare,a bodkin's point.
Shakespeare,"Why, boy, how is it?"
Shakespeare,"I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,"
Shakespeare,how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
Shakespeare,"point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!"
Shakespeare,"sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em, now the"
Shakespeare,"ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon"
Shakespeare,"swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a"
Shakespeare,cork into a hogshead. And then for the
Shakespeare,"land-service, to see how the bear tore out his"
Shakespeare,"shoulder-bone, how he cried to me for help and said"
Shakespeare,"his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an"
Shakespeare,"end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned"
Shakespeare,"it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the"
Shakespeare,"sea mocked them, and how the poor gentleman roared"
Shakespeare,"and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than"
Shakespeare,the sea or weather.
Shakespeare,"Name of mercy, when was this, boy?"
Shakespeare,"Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these"
Shakespeare,"sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor"
Shakespeare,the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
Shakespeare,now.
Shakespeare,"Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!"
Shakespeare,"I would you had been by the ship side, to have"
Shakespeare,helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.
Shakespeare,"Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,"
Shakespeare,boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
Shakespeare,"dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for"
Shakespeare,"thee, look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's"
Shakespeare,"child! look thee here, take up, take up, boy,"
Shakespeare,"open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be"
Shakespeare,rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
Shakespeare,"open't. What's within, boy?"
Shakespeare,You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
Shakespeare,"are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!"
Shakespeare,"This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up"
Shakespeare,"with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way."
Shakespeare,"We are lucky, boy, and to be so still requires"
Shakespeare,"nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good"
Shakespeare,"boy, the next way home."
Shakespeare,Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
Shakespeare,if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
Shakespeare,he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
Shakespeare,"are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury"
Shakespeare,That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
Shakespeare,"which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the"
Shakespeare,sight of him.
Shakespeare,"Marry, will I, and you shall help to put him i' the ground."
Shakespeare,"'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't."
Shakespeare,"Enter Time, the Chorus"
Shakespeare,"I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror"
Shakespeare,"Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,"
Shakespeare,"Now take upon me, in the name of Time,"
Shakespeare,To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
Shakespeare,"To me or my swift passage, that I slide"
Shakespeare,O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
Shakespeare,"Of that wide gap, since it is in my power"
Shakespeare,To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
Shakespeare,To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
Shakespeare,"The same I am, ere ancient'st order was"
Shakespeare,Or what is now received: I witness to
Shakespeare,"The times that brought them in, so shall I do"
Shakespeare,To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
Shakespeare,"The glistering of this present, as my tale"
Shakespeare,"Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,"
Shakespeare,I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
Shakespeare,"As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,"
Shakespeare,The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
Shakespeare,"That he shuts up himself, imagine me,"
Shakespeare,"Gentle spectators, that I now may be"
Shakespeare,"In fair Bohemia, and remember well,"
Shakespeare,"I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel"
Shakespeare,"I now name to you, and with speed so pace"
Shakespeare,"To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace"
Shakespeare,Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
Shakespeare,"I list not prophecy, but let Time's news"
Shakespeare,Be known when 'tis brought forth.
Shakespeare,"A shepherd's daughter,"
Shakespeare,"And what to her adheres, which follows after,"
Shakespeare,"Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,"
Shakespeare,"If ever you have spent time worse ere now,"
Shakespeare,"If never, yet that Time himself doth say"
Shakespeare,He wishes earnestly you never may.
Shakespeare,SCENE II. Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.
Shakespeare,Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO
Shakespeare,"I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:"
Shakespeare,"'tis a sickness denying thee any thing, a death to"
Shakespeare,grant this.
Shakespeare,It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
Shakespeare,"I have for the most part been aired abroad, I"
Shakespeare,"desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent"
Shakespeare,"king, my master, hath sent for me, to whose feeling"
Shakespeare,"sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to"
Shakespeare,"think so, which is another spur to my departure."
Shakespeare,"As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of"
Shakespeare,thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
Shakespeare,"thee thine own goodness hath made, better not to"
Shakespeare,"have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having"
Shakespeare,made me businesses which none without thee can
Shakespeare,"sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute"
Shakespeare,them thyself or take away with thee the very
Shakespeare,"services thou hast done, which if I have not enough"
Shakespeare,"considered, as too much I cannot, to be more"
Shakespeare,"thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit"
Shakespeare,therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
Shakespeare,"country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very"
Shakespeare,naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
Shakespeare,"penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,"
Shakespeare,"my brother, whose loss of his most precious queen"
Shakespeare,and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
Shakespeare,"Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my"
Shakespeare,"son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not"
Shakespeare,"being gracious, than they are in losing them when"
Shakespeare,they have approved their virtues.
Shakespeare,"Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What"
Shakespeare,"his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I"
Shakespeare,"have missingly noted, he is of late much retired"
Shakespeare,from court and is less frequent to his princely
Shakespeare,exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
Shakespeare,"I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some"
Shakespeare,"care, so far that I have eyes under my service which"
Shakespeare,"look upon his removedness, from whom I have this"
Shakespeare,"intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a"
Shakespeare,"most homely shepherd, a man, they say, that from"
Shakespeare,"very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his"
Shakespeare,"neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate."
Shakespeare,"I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a"
Shakespeare,daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
Shakespeare,extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.
Shakespeare,"That's likewise part of my intelligence, but, I"
Shakespeare,"fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou"
Shakespeare,"shalt accompany us to the place, where we will, not"
Shakespeare,"appearing what we are, have some question with the"
Shakespeare,"shepherd, from whose simplicity I think it not"
Shakespeare,uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
Shakespeare,"Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and"
Shakespeare,lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
Shakespeare,I willingly obey your command.
Shakespeare,My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.
Shakespeare,SCENE III. A road near the Shepherd's cottage.
Shakespeare,"Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing"
Shakespeare,"Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing"
Shakespeare,"When daffodils begin to peer,"
Shakespeare,"With heigh! the doxy over the dale,"
Shakespeare,"Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year,"
Shakespeare,For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
Shakespeare,"The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,"
Shakespeare,"With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!"
Shakespeare,"Doth set my pugging tooth on edge,"
Shakespeare,For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
Shakespeare,"The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,"
Shakespeare,"With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,"
Shakespeare,"Are summer songs for me and my aunts,"
Shakespeare,While we lie tumbling in the hay.
Shakespeare,I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
Shakespeare,"wore three-pile, but now I am out of service:"
Shakespeare,"But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?"
Shakespeare,The pale moon shines by night:
Shakespeare,"And when I wander here and there,"
Shakespeare,I then do most go right.
Shakespeare,"If tinkers may have leave to live,"
Shakespeare,"And bear the sow-skin budget,"
Shakespeare,"Then my account I well may, give,"
Shakespeare,And in the stocks avouch it.
Shakespeare,"My traffic is sheets, when the kite builds, look to"
Shakespeare,"lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus, who"
Shakespeare,"being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise"
Shakespeare,a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
Shakespeare,"drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is"
Shakespeare,the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful
Shakespeare,on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to
Shakespeare,"me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought"
Shakespeare,of it. A prize! a prize!
Shakespeare,"Let me see: every 'leven wether tods, every tod"
Shakespeare,"yields pound and odd shilling, fifteen hundred"
Shakespeare,shorn. what comes the wool to?
Shakespeare,"If the springe hold, the cock's mine."
Shakespeare,"I cannot do't without counters. Let me see, what am"
Shakespeare,I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
Shakespeare,"of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will"
Shakespeare,this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
Shakespeare,"hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it"
Shakespeare,on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
Shakespeare,"the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good"
Shakespeare,"ones, but they are most of them means and bases, but"
Shakespeare,"one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to"
Shakespeare,horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
Shakespeare,"pies, mace, dates?--none, that's out of my note,"
Shakespeare,"nutmegs, seven, a race or two of ginger, but that I"
Shakespeare,"may beg, four pound of prunes, and as many of"
Shakespeare,raisins o' the sun.
Shakespeare,O that ever I was born!
Shakespeare,Grovelling on the ground
Shakespeare,I' the name of me--
Shakespeare,"O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags, and"
Shakespeare,"then, death, death!"
Shakespeare,"Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay"
Shakespeare,"on thee, rather than have these off."
Shakespeare,"O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more"
Shakespeare,"than the stripes I have received, which are mighty"
Shakespeare,ones and millions.
Shakespeare,"Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a"
Shakespeare,great matter.
Shakespeare,"I am robbed, sir, and beaten, my money and apparel"
Shakespeare,"ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon"
Shakespeare,"What, by a horseman, or a footman?"
Shakespeare,"A footman, sweet sir, a footman."
Shakespeare,"Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he"
Shakespeare,"has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,"
Shakespeare,"it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,"
Shakespeare,"I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand."
Shakespeare,"O, good sir, tenderly, O!"
Shakespeare,"Alas, poor soul!"
Shakespeare,"O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my"
Shakespeare,shoulder-blade is out.
Shakespeare,How now! canst stand?
Shakespeare,[Picking his pocket]
Shakespeare,"Softly, dear sir, good sir, softly. You ha' done me"
Shakespeare,a charitable office.
Shakespeare,Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.
Shakespeare,"No, good sweet sir, no, I beseech you, sir: I have"
Shakespeare,"a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,"
Shakespeare,"unto whom I was going, I shall there have money, or"
Shakespeare,"any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you,"
Shakespeare,that kills my heart.
Shakespeare,What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
Shakespeare,"A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with"
Shakespeare,"troll-my-dames, I knew him once a servant of the"
Shakespeare,"prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his"
Shakespeare,"virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court."
Shakespeare,"His vices, you would say, there's no virtue whipped"
Shakespeare,out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
Shakespeare,"there, and yet it will no more but abide."
Shakespeare,"Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he"
Shakespeare,"hath been since an ape-bearer, then a"
Shakespeare,"process-server, a bailiff, then he compassed a"
Shakespeare,"motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's"
Shakespeare,"wife within a mile where my land and living lies,"
Shakespeare,"and, having flown over many knavish professions, he"
Shakespeare,settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.
Shakespeare,"Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts"
Shakespeare,"wakes, fairs and bear-baitings."
Shakespeare,"Very true, sir, he, sir, he, that's the rogue that"
Shakespeare,put me into this apparel.
Shakespeare,Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
Shakespeare,"but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run."
Shakespeare,"I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am"
Shakespeare,"false of heart that way, and that he knew, I warrant"
Shakespeare,How do you now?
Shakespeare,"Sweet sir, much better than I was, I can stand and"
Shakespeare,"walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace"
Shakespeare,softly towards my kinsman's.
Shakespeare,Shall I bring thee on the way?
Shakespeare,"No, good-faced sir, no, sweet sir."
Shakespeare,Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
Shakespeare,sheep-shearing.
Shakespeare,"Prosper you, sweet sir!"
Shakespeare,Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
Shakespeare,I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
Shakespeare,make not this cheat bring out another and the
Shakespeare,"shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name"
Shakespeare,put in the book of virtue!
Shakespeare,"Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,"
Shakespeare,And merrily hent the stile-a:
Shakespeare,"A merry heart goes all the day,"
Shakespeare,Your sad tires in a mile-a.
Shakespeare,SCENE IV. The Shepherd's cottage.
Shakespeare,Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA
Shakespeare,These your unusual weeds to each part of you
Shakespeare,"Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora"
Shakespeare,Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
Shakespeare,"Is as a meeting of the petty gods,"
Shakespeare,And you the queen on't.
Shakespeare,"Sir, my gracious lord,"
Shakespeare,To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
Shakespeare,"O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,"
Shakespeare,"The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured"
Shakespeare,"With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,"
Shakespeare,Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
Shakespeare,In every mess have folly and the feeders
Shakespeare,"Digest it with a custom, I should blush"
Shakespeare,"To see you so attired, sworn, I think,"
Shakespeare,To show myself a glass.
Shakespeare,I bless the time
Shakespeare,When my good falcon made her flight across
Shakespeare,Thy father's ground.
Shakespeare,Now Jove afford you cause!
Shakespeare,"To me the difference forges dread, your greatness"
Shakespeare,Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
Shakespeare,"To think your father, by some accident,"
Shakespeare,"Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!"
Shakespeare,"How would he look, to see his work so noble"
Shakespeare,Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
Shakespeare,"Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold"
Shakespeare,The sternness of his presence?
Shakespeare,Apprehend
Shakespeare,"Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,"
Shakespeare,"Humbling their deities to love, have taken"
Shakespeare,The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
Shakespeare,"Became a bull, and bellow'd, the green Neptune"
Shakespeare,"A ram, and bleated, and the fire-robed god,"
Shakespeare,"Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,"
Shakespeare,As I seem now. Their transformations
Shakespeare,"Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,"
Shakespeare,"Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires"
Shakespeare,"Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts"
Shakespeare,Burn hotter than my faith.
Shakespeare,"O, but, sir,"
Shakespeare,"Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis"
Shakespeare,"Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:"
Shakespeare,"One of these two must be necessities,"
Shakespeare,"Which then will speak, that you must"
Shakespeare,"change this purpose,"
Shakespeare,Or I my life.
Shakespeare,"Thou dearest Perdita,"
Shakespeare,"With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not"
Shakespeare,"The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,"
Shakespeare,Or not my father's. For I cannot be
Shakespeare,"Mine own, nor any thing to any, if"
Shakespeare,"I be not thine. To this I am most constant,"
Shakespeare,"Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle,"
Shakespeare,Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
Shakespeare,That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
Shakespeare,"Lift up your countenance, as it were the day"
Shakespeare,Of celebration of that nuptial which
Shakespeare,We two have sworn shall come.
Shakespeare,"O lady Fortune,"
Shakespeare,Stand you auspicious!
Shakespeare,"See, your guests approach:"
Shakespeare,"Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,"
Shakespeare,And let's be red with mirth.
Shakespeare,"Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised"
Shakespeare,"Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon"
Shakespeare,"This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,"
Shakespeare,"Both dame and servant, welcomed all, served all,"
Shakespeare,"Would sing her song and dance her turn, now here,"
Shakespeare,"At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle,"
Shakespeare,"On his shoulder, and his, her face o' fire"
Shakespeare,"With labour and the thing she took to quench it,"
Shakespeare,"She would to each one sip. You are retired,"
Shakespeare,As if you were a feasted one and not
Shakespeare,"The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid"
Shakespeare,"These unknown friends to's welcome, for it is"
Shakespeare,"A way to make us better friends, more known."
Shakespeare,"Come, quench your blushes and present yourself"
Shakespeare,"That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,"
Shakespeare,"And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,"
Shakespeare,As your good flock shall prosper.
Shakespeare,"[To POLIXENES]                  Sir, welcome:"
Shakespeare,It is my father's will I should take on me
Shakespeare,The hostess-ship o' the day.
Shakespeare,To CAMILLO
Shakespeare,To CAMILLO
Shakespeare,"You're welcome, sir."
Shakespeare,"Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,"
Shakespeare,"For you there's rosemary and rue, these keep"
Shakespeare,Seeming and savour all the winter long:
Shakespeare,"Grace and remembrance be to you both,"
Shakespeare,And welcome to our shearing!
Shakespeare,"Shepherdess,"
Shakespeare,A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
Shakespeare,With flowers of winter.
Shakespeare,"Sir, the year growing ancient,"
Shakespeare,"Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth"
Shakespeare,"Of trembling winter, the fairest"
Shakespeare,flowers o' the season
Shakespeare,"Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,"
Shakespeare,Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
Shakespeare,"Our rustic garden's barren, and I care not"
Shakespeare,To get slips of them.
Shakespeare,"Wherefore, gentle maiden,"
Shakespeare,Do you neglect them?
Shakespeare,For I have heard it said
Shakespeare,There is an art which in their piedness shares
Shakespeare,With great creating nature.
Shakespeare,"Say there be,"
Shakespeare,Yet nature is made better by no mean
Shakespeare,"But nature makes that mean: so, over that art"
Shakespeare,"Which you say adds to nature, is an art"
Shakespeare,"That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry"
Shakespeare,"A gentler scion to the wildest stock,"
Shakespeare,And make conceive a bark of baser kind
Shakespeare,By bud of nobler race: this is an art
Shakespeare,"Which does mend nature, change it rather, but"
Shakespeare,The art itself is nature.
Shakespeare,So it is.
Shakespeare,"Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,"
Shakespeare,And do not call them bastards.
Shakespeare,I'll not put
Shakespeare,"The dibble in earth to set one slip of them,"
Shakespeare,No more than were I painted I would wish
Shakespeare,This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
Shakespeare,"Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you,"
Shakespeare,"Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram,"
Shakespeare,"The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun"
Shakespeare,And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
Shakespeare,"Of middle summer, and I think they are given"
Shakespeare,To men of middle age. You're very welcome.
Shakespeare,"I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,"
Shakespeare,And only live by gazing.
Shakespeare,"Out, alas!"
Shakespeare,"You'd be so lean, that blasts of January"
Shakespeare,Would blow you through and through.
Shakespeare,"Now, my fair'st friend,"
Shakespeare,I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
Shakespeare,"Become your time of day, and yours, and yours,"
Shakespeare,That wear upon your virgin branches yet
Shakespeare,"Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,"
Shakespeare,"For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall"
Shakespeare,"From Dis's waggon! daffodils,"
Shakespeare,"That come before the swallow dares, and take"
Shakespeare,"The winds of March with beauty, violets dim,"
Shakespeare,But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
Shakespeare,"Or Cytherea's breath, pale primroses"
Shakespeare,"That die unmarried, ere they can behold"
Shakespeare,Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
Shakespeare,"Most incident to maids, bold oxlips and"
Shakespeare,"The crown imperial, lilies of all kinds,"
Shakespeare,"The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,"
Shakespeare,"To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,"
Shakespeare,To strew him o'er and o'er!
Shakespeare,"What, like a corse?"
Shakespeare,"No, like a bank for love to lie and play on,"
Shakespeare,"Not like a corse, or if, not to be buried,"
Shakespeare,"But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:"
Shakespeare,Methinks I play as I have seen them do
Shakespeare,In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Shakespeare,Does change my disposition.
Shakespeare,What you do
Shakespeare,"Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet."
Shakespeare,"I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,"
Shakespeare,"I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,"
Shakespeare,"Pray so, and, for the ordering your affairs,"
Shakespeare,"To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you"
Shakespeare,"A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do"
Shakespeare,"Nothing but that, move still, still so,"
Shakespeare,"And own no other function: each your doing,"
Shakespeare,"So singular in each particular,"
Shakespeare,"Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,"
Shakespeare,That all your acts are queens.
Shakespeare,"O Doricles,"
Shakespeare,"Your praises are too large: but that your youth,"
Shakespeare,"And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,"
Shakespeare,"Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,"
Shakespeare,"With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,"
Shakespeare,You woo'd me the false way.
Shakespeare,I think you have
Shakespeare,As little skill to fear as I have purpose
Shakespeare,"To put you to't. But come, our dance, I pray:"
Shakespeare,"Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,"
Shakespeare,That never mean to part.
Shakespeare,I'll swear for 'em.
Shakespeare,This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
Shakespeare,Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
Shakespeare,"But smacks of something greater than herself,"
Shakespeare,Too noble for this place.
Shakespeare,He tells her something
Shakespeare,"That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is"
Shakespeare,The queen of curds and cream.
Shakespeare,"Come on, strike up!"
Shakespeare,"Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,"
Shakespeare,To mend her kissing with!
Shakespeare,"Now, in good time!"
Shakespeare,"Not a word, a word, we stand upon our manners."
Shakespeare,"Come, strike up!"
Shakespeare,Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses
Shakespeare,"Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this"
Shakespeare,Which dances with your daughter?
Shakespeare,"They call him Doricles, and boasts himself"
Shakespeare,To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
Shakespeare,"Upon his own report and I believe it,"
Shakespeare,He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
Shakespeare,"I think so too, for never gazed the moon"
Shakespeare,Upon the water as he'll stand and read
Shakespeare,"As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain."
Shakespeare,I think there is not half a kiss to choose
Shakespeare,Who loves another best.
Shakespeare,She dances featly.
Shakespeare,"So she does any thing, though I report it,"
Shakespeare,That should be silent: if young Doricles
Shakespeare,"Do light upon her, she shall bring him that"
Shakespeare,Which he not dreams of.
Shakespeare,"O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the"
Shakespeare,"door, you would never dance again after a tabour and"
Shakespeare,"pipe, no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings"
Shakespeare,"several tunes faster than you'll tell money, he"
Shakespeare,utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
Shakespeare,ears grew to his tunes.
Shakespeare,"He could never come better, he shall come in. I"
Shakespeare,"love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful"
Shakespeare,"matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing"
Shakespeare,indeed and sung lamentably.
Shakespeare,"He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes, no"
Shakespeare,milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
Shakespeare,"has the prettiest love-songs for maids, so without"
Shakespeare,"bawdry, which is strange, with such delicate"
Shakespeare,"burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump"
Shakespeare,"her,' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,"
Shakespeare,"as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into"
Shakespeare,"the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me"
Shakespeare,"no harm, good man,' puts him off, slights him, with"
Shakespeare,"'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'"
Shakespeare,This is a brave fellow.
Shakespeare,"Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited"
Shakespeare,fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?
Shakespeare,"He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow,"
Shakespeare,points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
Shakespeare,"learnedly handle, though they come to him by the"
Shakespeare,"gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he"
Shakespeare,"sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses, you"
Shakespeare,"would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants"
Shakespeare,to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.
Shakespeare,"Prithee bring him in, and let him approach singing."
Shakespeare,Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.
Shakespeare,"You have of these pedlars, that have more in them"
Shakespeare,"than you'ld think, sister."
Shakespeare,"Ay, good brother, or go about to think."
Shakespeare,"Lawn as white as driven snow,"
Shakespeare,"Cyprus black as e'er was crow,"
Shakespeare,"Gloves as sweet as damask roses,"
Shakespeare,"Masks for faces and for noses,"
Shakespeare,"Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,"
Shakespeare,"Perfume for a lady's chamber,"
Shakespeare,"Golden quoifs and stomachers,"
Shakespeare,For my lads to give their dears:
Shakespeare,"Pins and poking-sticks of steel,"
Shakespeare,What maids lack from head to heel:
Shakespeare,"Come buy of me, come, come buy, come buy,"
Shakespeare,"Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy."
Shakespeare,"If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take"
Shakespeare,"no money of me, but being enthralled as I am, it"
Shakespeare,will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.
Shakespeare,"I was promised them against the feast, but they come"
Shakespeare,not too late now.
Shakespeare,"He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars."
Shakespeare,"He hath paid you all he promised you, may be, he has"
Shakespeare,"paid you more, which will shame you to give him again."
Shakespeare,Is there no manners left among maids? will they
Shakespeare,wear their plackets where they should bear their
Shakespeare,"faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are"
Shakespeare,"going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these"
Shakespeare,"secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all"
Shakespeare,our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
Shakespeare,"your tongues, and not a word more."
Shakespeare,"I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace"
Shakespeare,and a pair of sweet gloves.
Shakespeare,Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
Shakespeare,and lost all my money?
Shakespeare,"And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad,"
Shakespeare,therefore it behoves men to be wary.
Shakespeare,"Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here."
Shakespeare,"I hope so, sir, for I have about me many parcels of charge."
Shakespeare,What hast here? ballads?
Shakespeare,"Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'"
Shakespeare,"life, for then we are sure they are true."
Shakespeare,"Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's"
Shakespeare,wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
Shakespeare,burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
Shakespeare,toads carbonadoed.
Shakespeare,"Is it true, think you?"
Shakespeare,"Very true, and but a month old."
Shakespeare,Bless me from marrying a usurer!
Shakespeare,"Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress"
Shakespeare,"Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were"
Shakespeare,present. Why should I carry lies abroad?
Shakespeare,"Pray you now, buy it."
Shakespeare,"Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe"
Shakespeare,"ballads, we'll buy the other things anon."
Shakespeare,"Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon"
Shakespeare,"the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,"
Shakespeare,"forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this"
Shakespeare,ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
Shakespeare,thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
Shakespeare,fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
Shakespeare,loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.
Shakespeare,"Is it true too, think you?"
Shakespeare,"Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than"
Shakespeare,my pack will hold.
Shakespeare,Lay it by too: another.
Shakespeare,"This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one."
Shakespeare,Let's have some merry ones.
Shakespeare,"Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to"
Shakespeare,the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
Shakespeare,"scarce a maid westward but she sings it, 'tis in"
Shakespeare,"request, I can tell you."
Shakespeare,"We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou"
Shakespeare,"shalt hear, 'tis in three parts."
Shakespeare,We had the tune on't a month ago.
Shakespeare,"I can bear my part, you must know 'tis my"
Shakespeare,"occupation, have at it with you."
Shakespeare,"Get you hence, for I must go"
Shakespeare,Where it fits not you to know.
Shakespeare,"O, whither?"
Shakespeare,"It becomes thy oath full well,"
Shakespeare,Thou to me thy secrets tell.
Shakespeare,"Me too, let me go thither."
Shakespeare,Or thou goest to the orange or mill.
Shakespeare,"If to either, thou dost ill."
Shakespeare,"What, neither?"
Shakespeare,Thou hast sworn my love to be.
Shakespeare,Thou hast sworn it more to me:
Shakespeare,"Then whither goest? say, whither?"
Shakespeare,We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
Shakespeare,"father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll"
Shakespeare,"not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after"
Shakespeare,"me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's"
Shakespeare,"have the first choice. Follow me, girls."
Shakespeare,Exit with DORCAS and MOPSA
Shakespeare,And you shall pay well for 'em.
Shakespeare,Follows singing
Shakespeare,"Will you buy any tape,"
Shakespeare,"Or lace for your cape,"
Shakespeare,"My dainty duck, my dear-a?"
Shakespeare,"Any silk, any thread,"
Shakespeare,"Any toys for your head,"
Shakespeare,"Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?"
Shakespeare,"Come to the pedlar,"
Shakespeare,Money's a medler.
Shakespeare,That doth utter all men's ware-a.
Shakespeare,"Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,"
Shakespeare,"three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made"
Shakespeare,"themselves all men of hair, they call themselves"
Shakespeare,"Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches"
Shakespeare,"say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are"
Shakespeare,"not in't, but they themselves are o' the mind, if it"
Shakespeare,be not too rough for some that know little but
Shakespeare,"bowling, it will please plentifully."
Shakespeare,Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
Shakespeare,"homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you."
Shakespeare,"You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see"
Shakespeare,these four threes of herdsmen.
Shakespeare,"One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath"
Shakespeare,"danced before the king, and not the worst of the"
Shakespeare,three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.
Shakespeare,Leave your prating: since these good men are
Shakespeare,"pleased, let them come in, but quickly now."
Shakespeare,"Why, they stay at door, sir."
Shakespeare,Here a dance of twelve Satyrs
Shakespeare,"O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter."
Shakespeare,Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
Shakespeare,He's simple and tells much.
Shakespeare,To FLORIZEL
Shakespeare,To FLORIZEL
Shakespeare,"How now, fair shepherd!"
Shakespeare,Your heart is full of something that does take
Shakespeare,"Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young"
Shakespeare,"And handed love as you do, I was wont"
Shakespeare,To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
Shakespeare,The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
Shakespeare,"To her acceptance, you have let him go"
Shakespeare,And nothing marted with him. If your lass
Shakespeare,Interpretation should abuse and call this
Shakespeare,"Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited"
Shakespeare,"For a reply, at least if you make a care"
Shakespeare,Of happy holding her.
Shakespeare,"Old sir, I know"
Shakespeare,She prizes not such trifles as these are:
Shakespeare,The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
Shakespeare,"Up in my heart, which I have given already,"
Shakespeare,"But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life"
Shakespeare,"Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,"
Shakespeare,"Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,"
Shakespeare,"As soft as dove's down and as white as it,"
Shakespeare,"Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd"
Shakespeare,snow that's bolted
Shakespeare,By the northern blasts twice o'er.
Shakespeare,What follows this?
Shakespeare,How prettily the young swain seems to wash
Shakespeare,The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
Shakespeare,"But to your protestation, let me hear"
Shakespeare,What you profess.
Shakespeare,"Do, and be witness to 't."
Shakespeare,And this my neighbour too?
Shakespeare,"And he, and more"
Shakespeare,"Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:"
Shakespeare,"That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,"
Shakespeare,"Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth"
Shakespeare,"That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge"
Shakespeare,"More than was ever man's, I would not prize them"
Shakespeare,"Without her love, for her employ them all,"
Shakespeare,Commend them and condemn them to her service
Shakespeare,Or to their own perdition.
Shakespeare,Fairly offer'd.
Shakespeare,This shows a sound affection.
Shakespeare,"But, my daughter,"
Shakespeare,Say you the like to him?
Shakespeare,I cannot speak
Shakespeare,"So well, nothing so well, no, nor mean better:"
Shakespeare,By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
Shakespeare,The purity of his.
Shakespeare,"Take hands, a bargain!"
Shakespeare,"And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:"
Shakespeare,"I give my daughter to him, and will make"
Shakespeare,Her portion equal his.
Shakespeare,"O, that must be"
Shakespeare,"I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,"
Shakespeare,"I shall have more than you can dream of yet,"
Shakespeare,"Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,"
Shakespeare,Contract us 'fore these witnesses.
Shakespeare,"Come, your hand,"
Shakespeare,"And, daughter, yours."
Shakespeare,"Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you,"
Shakespeare,Have you a father?
Shakespeare,I have: but what of him?
Shakespeare,Knows he of this?
Shakespeare,He neither does nor shall.
Shakespeare,Methinks a father
Shakespeare,Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
Shakespeare,"That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,"
Shakespeare,Is not your father grown incapable
Shakespeare,Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
Shakespeare,With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
Shakespeare,Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
Shakespeare,Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
Shakespeare,But what he did being childish?
Shakespeare,"No, good sir,"
Shakespeare,He has his health and ampler strength indeed
Shakespeare,Than most have of his age.
Shakespeare,"By my white beard,"
Shakespeare,"You offer him, if this be so, a wrong"
Shakespeare,Something unfilial: reason my son
Shakespeare,"Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason"
Shakespeare,"The father, all whose joy is nothing else"
Shakespeare,"But fair posterity, should hold some counsel"
Shakespeare,"I yield all this,"
Shakespeare,"But for some other reasons, my grave sir,"
Shakespeare,"Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint"
Shakespeare,My father of this business.
Shakespeare,Let him know't.
Shakespeare,He shall not.
Shakespeare,"Prithee, let him."
Shakespeare,"No, he must not."
Shakespeare,"Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve"
Shakespeare,At knowing of thy choice.
Shakespeare,"Come, come, he must not."
Shakespeare,Mark our contract.
Shakespeare,"Mark your divorce, young sir,"
Shakespeare,Discovering himself
Shakespeare,"Whom son I dare not call, thou art too base"
Shakespeare,"To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,"
Shakespeare,"That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,"
Shakespeare,I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
Shakespeare,"But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece"
Shakespeare,"Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know"
Shakespeare,"The royal fool thou copest with,--"
Shakespeare,"O, my heart!"
Shakespeare,"I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made"
Shakespeare,"More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,"
Shakespeare,If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
Shakespeare,"That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never"
Shakespeare,"I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession,"
Shakespeare,"Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,"
Shakespeare,Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
Shakespeare,"Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,"
Shakespeare,"Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee"
Shakespeare,"From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--"
Shakespeare,"Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,"
Shakespeare,"That makes himself, but for our honour therein,"
Shakespeare,"Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou"
Shakespeare,"These rural latches to his entrance open,"
Shakespeare,"Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,"
Shakespeare,I will devise a death as cruel for thee
Shakespeare,As thou art tender to't.
Shakespeare,Even here undone!
Shakespeare,"I was not much afeard, for once or twice"
Shakespeare,"I was about to speak and tell him plainly,"
Shakespeare,The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
Shakespeare,Hides not his visage from our cottage but
Shakespeare,"Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?"
Shakespeare,"I told you what would come of this: beseech you,"
Shakespeare,"Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--"
Shakespeare,"Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,"
Shakespeare,But milk my ewes and weep.
Shakespeare,"Why, how now, father!"
Shakespeare,Speak ere thou diest.
Shakespeare,"I cannot speak, nor think"
Shakespeare,Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
Shakespeare,"You have undone a man of fourscore three,"
Shakespeare,"That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,"
Shakespeare,"To die upon the bed my father died,"
Shakespeare,To lie close by his honest bones: but now
Shakespeare,Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
Shakespeare,"Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,"
Shakespeare,"That knew'st this was the prince,"
Shakespeare,and wouldst adventure
Shakespeare,To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
Shakespeare,"If I might die within this hour, I have lived"
Shakespeare,To die when I desire.
Shakespeare,Why look you so upon me?
Shakespeare,"I am but sorry, not afeard, delay'd,"
Shakespeare,"But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am,"
Shakespeare,"More straining on for plucking back, not following"
Shakespeare,My leash unwillingly.
Shakespeare,You know your father's temper: at this time
Shakespeare,"He will allow no speech, which I do guess"
Shakespeare,"You do not purpose to him, and as hardly"
Shakespeare,"Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:"
Shakespeare,"Then, till the fury of his highness settle,"
Shakespeare,Come not before him.
Shakespeare,I not purpose it.
Shakespeare,"I think, Camillo?"
Shakespeare,"Even he, my lord."
Shakespeare,How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
Shakespeare,"How often said, my dignity would last"
Shakespeare,But till 'twere known!
Shakespeare,It cannot fail but by
Shakespeare,"The violation of my faith, and then"
Shakespeare,Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
Shakespeare,And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
Shakespeare,"From my succession wipe me, father, I"
Shakespeare,Am heir to my affection.
Shakespeare,Be advised.
Shakespeare,"I am, and by my fancy: if my reason"
Shakespeare,"Will thereto be obedient, I have reason,"
Shakespeare,"If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,"
Shakespeare,Do bid it welcome.
Shakespeare,"This is desperate, sir."
Shakespeare,"So call it: but it does fulfil my vow,"
Shakespeare,"I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,"
Shakespeare,"Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may"
Shakespeare,"Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or"
Shakespeare,The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
Shakespeare,"In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath"
Shakespeare,"To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,"
Shakespeare,"As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,"
Shakespeare,"When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not"
Shakespeare,"To see him any more,--cast your good counsels"
Shakespeare,"Upon his passion, let myself and fortune"
Shakespeare,Tug for the time to come. This you may know
Shakespeare,"And so deliver, I am put to sea"
Shakespeare,"With her whom here I cannot hold on shore,"
Shakespeare,And most opportune to our need I have
Shakespeare,"A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared"
Shakespeare,For this design. What course I mean to hold
Shakespeare,"Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor"
Shakespeare,Concern me the reporting.
Shakespeare,O my lord!
Shakespeare,"I would your spirit were easier for advice,"
Shakespeare,Or stronger for your need.
Shakespeare,"Hark, Perdita"
Shakespeare,I'll hear you by and by.
Shakespeare,"He's irremoveable,"
Shakespeare,"Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if"
Shakespeare,"His going I could frame to serve my turn,"
Shakespeare,"Save him from danger, do him love and honour,"
Shakespeare,Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
Shakespeare,"And that unhappy king, my master, whom"
Shakespeare,I so much thirst to see.
Shakespeare,"Now, good Camillo,"
Shakespeare,I am so fraught with curious business that
Shakespeare,I leave out ceremony.
Shakespeare,"Sir, I think"
Shakespeare,"You have heard of my poor services, i' the love"
Shakespeare,That I have borne your father?
Shakespeare,Very nobly
Shakespeare,Have you deserved: it is my father's music
Shakespeare,"To speak your deeds, not little of his care"
Shakespeare,To have them recompensed as thought on.
Shakespeare,"Well, my lord,"
Shakespeare,If you may please to think I love the king
Shakespeare,"And through him what is nearest to him, which is"
Shakespeare,"Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:"
Shakespeare,If your more ponderous and settled project
Shakespeare,"May suffer alteration, on mine honour,"
Shakespeare,I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
Shakespeare,"As shall become your highness, where you may"
Shakespeare,"Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,"
Shakespeare,"There's no disjunction to be made, but by--"
Shakespeare,"As heavens forefend!--your ruin, marry her,"
Shakespeare,"And, with my best endeavours in your absence,"
Shakespeare,Your discontenting father strive to qualify
Shakespeare,And bring him up to liking.
Shakespeare,"How, Camillo,"
Shakespeare,"May this, almost a miracle, be done?"
Shakespeare,That I may call thee something more than man
Shakespeare,And after that trust to thee.
Shakespeare,Have you thought on
Shakespeare,A place whereto you'll go?
Shakespeare,Not any yet:
Shakespeare,But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
Shakespeare,"To what we wildly do, so we profess"
Shakespeare,Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
Shakespeare,Of every wind that blows.
Shakespeare,Then list to me:
Shakespeare,"This follows, if you will not change your purpose"
Shakespeare,"But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,"
Shakespeare,"And there present yourself and your fair princess,"
Shakespeare,"For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:"
Shakespeare,She shall be habited as it becomes
Shakespeare,The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
Shakespeare,Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
Shakespeare,"His welcomes forth, asks thee the son forgiveness,"
Shakespeare,"As 'twere i' the father's person, kisses the hands"
Shakespeare,"Of your fresh princess, o'er and o'er divides him"
Shakespeare,"'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness, the one"
Shakespeare,He chides to hell and bids the other grow
Shakespeare,Faster than thought or time.
Shakespeare,"Worthy Camillo,"
Shakespeare,What colour for my visitation shall I
Shakespeare,Hold up before him?
Shakespeare,Sent by the king your father
Shakespeare,"To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,"
Shakespeare,"The manner of your bearing towards him, with"
Shakespeare,"What you as from your father shall deliver,"
Shakespeare,"Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:"
Shakespeare,The which shall point you forth at every sitting
Shakespeare,"What you must say, that he shall not perceive"
Shakespeare,But that you have your father's bosom there
Shakespeare,And speak his very heart.
Shakespeare,I am bound to you:
Shakespeare,There is some sap in this.
Shakespeare,A cause more promising
Shakespeare,Than a wild dedication of yourselves
Shakespeare,"To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain"
Shakespeare,"To miseries enough, no hope to help you,"
Shakespeare,"But as you shake off one to take another,"
Shakespeare,"Nothing so certain as your anchors, who"
Shakespeare,"Do their best office, if they can but stay you"
Shakespeare,Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
Shakespeare,"Prosperity's the very bond of love,"
Shakespeare,Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Shakespeare,Affliction alters.
Shakespeare,One of these is true:
Shakespeare,"I think affliction may subdue the cheek,"
Shakespeare,But not take in the mind.
Shakespeare,"Yea, say you so?"
Shakespeare,There shall not at your father's house these
Shakespeare,seven years
Shakespeare,Be born another such.
Shakespeare,"My good Camillo,"
Shakespeare,She is as forward of her breeding as
Shakespeare,She is i' the rear our birth.
Shakespeare,I cannot say 'tis pity
Shakespeare,"She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress"
Shakespeare,To most that teach.
Shakespeare,"Your pardon, sir, for this"
Shakespeare,I'll blush you thanks.
Shakespeare,My prettiest Perdita!
Shakespeare,"But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,"
Shakespeare,"Preserver of my father, now of me,"
Shakespeare,"The medicine of our house, how shall we do?"
Shakespeare,"We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,"
Shakespeare,Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
Shakespeare,Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
Shakespeare,Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
Shakespeare,To have you royally appointed as if
Shakespeare,"The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,"
Shakespeare,"That you may know you shall not want, one word."
Shakespeare,They talk aside
Shakespeare,Re-enter AUTOLYCUS
Shakespeare,"Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his"
Shakespeare,"sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold"
Shakespeare,"all my trumpery, not a counterfeit stone, not a"
Shakespeare,"ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,"
Shakespeare,"knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,"
Shakespeare,to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
Shakespeare,"should buy first, as if my trinkets had been"
Shakespeare,hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
Shakespeare,by which means I saw whose purse was best in
Shakespeare,"picture, and what I saw, to my good use I"
Shakespeare,"remembered. My clown, who wants but something to"
Shakespeare,"be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the"
Shakespeare,"wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes"
Shakespeare,"till he had both tune and words, which so drew the"
Shakespeare,rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
Shakespeare,"stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it"
Shakespeare,"was senseless, 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a"
Shakespeare,"purse, I could have filed keys off that hung in"
Shakespeare,"chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,"
Shakespeare,and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
Shakespeare,time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
Shakespeare,"festival purses, and had not the old man come in"
Shakespeare,with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
Shakespeare,"son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not"
Shakespeare,left a purse alive in the whole army.
Shakespeare,"CAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward"
Shakespeare,"Nay, but my letters, by this means being there"
Shakespeare,"So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt."
Shakespeare,And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--
Shakespeare,Shall satisfy your father.
Shakespeare,All that you speak shows fair.
Shakespeare,Who have we here?
Shakespeare,Seeing AUTOLYCUS
Shakespeare,"We'll make an instrument of this, omit"
Shakespeare,Nothing may give us aid.
Shakespeare,"If they have overheard me now, why, hanging."
Shakespeare,"How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear"
Shakespeare,"not, man, here's no harm intended to thee."
Shakespeare,"I am a poor fellow, sir."
Shakespeare,"I am a poor fellow, sir."
Shakespeare,"Why, be so still, here's nobody will steal that from"
Shakespeare,thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
Shakespeare,"make an exchange, therefore discase thee instantly,"
Shakespeare,"--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and"
Shakespeare,change garments with this gentleman: though the
Shakespeare,"pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,"
Shakespeare,there's some boot.
Shakespeare,I know ye well enough.
Shakespeare,"Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half"
Shakespeare,flayed already.
Shakespeare,"Are you in earnest, sir?"
Shakespeare,I smell the trick on't.
Shakespeare,"Dispatch, I prithee."
Shakespeare,"Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with"
Shakespeare,conscience take it.
Shakespeare,"Unbuckle, unbuckle."
Shakespeare,FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments
Shakespeare,"Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy"
Shakespeare,Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
Shakespeare,Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
Shakespeare,"And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,"
Shakespeare,"Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken"
Shakespeare,"The truth of your own seeming, that you may--"
Shakespeare,For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
Shakespeare,Get undescried.
Shakespeare,I see the play so lies
Shakespeare,That I must bear a part.
Shakespeare,Have you done there?
Shakespeare,"Should I now meet my father,"
Shakespeare,He would not call me son.
Shakespeare,"Nay, you shall have no hat."
Shakespeare,Giving it to PERDITA
Shakespeare,"Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend."
Shakespeare,"Adieu, sir."
Shakespeare,"O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!"
Shakespeare,"Pray you, a word."
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  What I do next, shall be to tell the king"
Shakespeare,"Of this escape and whither they are bound,"
Shakespeare,Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
Shakespeare,To force him after: in whose company
Shakespeare,"I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight"
Shakespeare,I have a woman's longing.
Shakespeare,Fortune speed us!
Shakespeare,"Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side."
Shakespeare,The swifter speed the better.
Shakespeare,"Exeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO"
Shakespeare,"I understand the business, I hear it: to have an"
Shakespeare,"open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is"
Shakespeare,"necessary for a cut-purse, a good nose is requisite"
Shakespeare,"also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see"
Shakespeare,this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
Shakespeare,What an exchange had this been without boot! What
Shakespeare,a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
Shakespeare,"this year connive at us, and we may do any thing"
Shakespeare,extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
Shakespeare,"iniquity, stealing away from his father with his"
Shakespeare,clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
Shakespeare,"honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not"
Shakespeare,"do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it,"
Shakespeare,and therein am I constant to my profession.
Shakespeare,Re-enter Clown and Shepherd
Shakespeare,"Aside, aside, here is more matter for a hot brain:"
Shakespeare,"every lane's end, every shop, church, session,"
Shakespeare,"hanging, yields a careful man work."
Shakespeare,"See, see, what a man you are now!"
Shakespeare,There is no other way but to tell the king
Shakespeare,she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.
Shakespeare,"Go to, then."
Shakespeare,"She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh"
Shakespeare,"and blood has not offended the king, and so your"
Shakespeare,flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
Shakespeare,"those things you found about her, those secret"
Shakespeare,"things, all but what she has with her: this being"
Shakespeare,"done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you."
Shakespeare,"I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his"
Shakespeare,"son's pranks too, who, I may say, is no honest man,"
Shakespeare,"neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make"
Shakespeare,me the king's brother-in-law.
Shakespeare,"Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you"
Shakespeare,could have been to him and then your blood had been
Shakespeare,the dearer by I know how much an ounce.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  Very wisely, puppies!"
Shakespeare,"Well, let us to the king: there is that in this"
Shakespeare,fardel will make him scratch his beard.
Shakespeare,[Aside]  I know not what impediment this complaint
Shakespeare,may be to the flight of my master.
Shakespeare,Pray heartily he be at palace.
Shakespeare,"[Aside]  Though I am not naturally honest, I am so"
Shakespeare,sometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.
Shakespeare,Takes off his false beard
Shakespeare,"How now, rustics! whither are you bound?"
Shakespeare,"To the palace, an it like your worship."
Shakespeare,"Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition"
Shakespeare,"of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your"
Shakespeare,"names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any"
Shakespeare,"thing that is fitting to be known, discover."
Shakespeare,"We are but plain fellows, sir."
Shakespeare,"A lie, you are rough and hairy. Let me have no"
Shakespeare,"lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they"
Shakespeare,often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
Shakespeare,"it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel, therefore"
Shakespeare,they do not give us the lie.
Shakespeare,"Your worship had like to have given us one, if you"
Shakespeare,had not taken yourself with the manner.
Shakespeare,"Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?"
Shakespeare,"Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest"
Shakespeare,thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
Shakespeare,hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
Shakespeare,receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
Shakespeare,"not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,"
Shakespeare,"for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy"
Shakespeare,"business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier"
Shakespeare,"cap-a-pe, and one that will either push on or pluck"
Shakespeare,back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to
Shakespeare,open thy affair.
Shakespeare,"My business, sir, is to the king."
Shakespeare,What advocate hast thou to him?
Shakespeare,"I know not, an't like you."
Shakespeare,Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
Shakespeare,have none.
Shakespeare,"None, sir, I have no pheasant, cock nor hen."
Shakespeare,How blessed are we that are not simple men!
Shakespeare,"Yet nature might have made me as these are,"
Shakespeare,Therefore I will not disdain.
Shakespeare,This cannot be but a great courtier.
Shakespeare,"His garments are rich, but he wears"
Shakespeare,them not handsomely.
Shakespeare,He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
Shakespeare,"a great man, I'll warrant, I know by the picking"
Shakespeare,on's teeth.
Shakespeare,The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
Shakespeare,Wherefore that box?
Shakespeare,"Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,"
Shakespeare,"which none must know but the king, and which he"
Shakespeare,"shall know within this hour, if I may come to the"
Shakespeare,speech of him.
Shakespeare,"Age, thou hast lost thy labour."
Shakespeare,"Why, sir?"
Shakespeare,"The king is not at the palace, he is gone aboard a"
Shakespeare,"new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,"
Shakespeare,"if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must"
Shakespeare,know the king is full of grief.
Shakespeare,"So 'tis said, sir, about his son, that should have"
Shakespeare,married a shepherd's daughter.
Shakespeare,"If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:"
Shakespeare,"the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall"
Shakespeare,"feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster."
Shakespeare,"Think you so, sir?"
Shakespeare,Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
Shakespeare,"and vengeance bitter, but those that are germane to"
Shakespeare,"him, though removed fifty times, shall all come"
Shakespeare,"under the hangman: which though it be great pity,"
Shakespeare,yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
Shakespeare,"ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into"
Shakespeare,"grace! Some say he shall be stoned, but that death"
Shakespeare,"is too soft for him, say I	draw our throne into a"
Shakespeare,"sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy."
Shakespeare,"Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't"
Shakespeare,"like you, sir?"
Shakespeare,"He has a son, who shall be flayed alive, then"
Shakespeare,"'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a"
Shakespeare,"wasp's nest, then stand till he be three quarters"
Shakespeare,"and a dram dead, then recovered again with"
Shakespeare,"aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion, then, raw as"
Shakespeare,"he is, and in the hottest day prognostication"
Shakespeare,"proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the"
Shakespeare,"sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he"
Shakespeare,is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
Shakespeare,"talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries"
Shakespeare,"are to be smiled at, their offences being so"
Shakespeare,"capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain"
Shakespeare,"men, what you have to the king: being something"
Shakespeare,"gently considered, I'll bring you where he is"
Shakespeare,"aboard, tender your persons to his presence,"
Shakespeare,"whisper him in your behalfs, and if it be in man"
Shakespeare,"besides the king to effect your suits, here is man"
Shakespeare,shall do it.
Shakespeare,"He seems to be of great authority: close with him,"
Shakespeare,"give him gold, and though authority be a stubborn"
Shakespeare,"bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show"
Shakespeare,"the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,"
Shakespeare,"and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'"
Shakespeare,"An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for"
Shakespeare,"us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much"
Shakespeare,more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.
Shakespeare,After I have done what I promised?
Shakespeare,"Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?"
Shakespeare,"In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful"
Shakespeare,"one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it."
Shakespeare,"O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,"
Shakespeare,he'll be made an example.
Shakespeare,"Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show"
Shakespeare,our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your
Shakespeare,"daughter nor my sister, we are gone else. Sir, I"
Shakespeare,will give you as much as this old man does when the
Shakespeare,"business is performed, and remain, as he says, your"
Shakespeare,pawn till it be brought you.
Shakespeare,"I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side,"
Shakespeare,go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
Shakespeare,hedge and follow you.
Shakespeare,"We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest."
Shakespeare,Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.
Shakespeare,Exeunt Shepherd and Clown
Shakespeare,"If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would"
Shakespeare,not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am
Shakespeare,"courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means"
Shakespeare,"to do the prince my master good, which who knows how"
Shakespeare,that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring
Shakespeare,"these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he"
Shakespeare,think it fit to shore them again and that the
Shakespeare,complaint they have to the king concerns him
Shakespeare,"nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far"
Shakespeare,"officious, for I am proof against that title and"
Shakespeare,what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
Shakespeare,them: there may be matter in it.
Shakespeare,"Enter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants"
Shakespeare,"Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd"
Shakespeare,"A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,"
Shakespeare,"Which you have not redeem'd, indeed, paid down"
Shakespeare,"More penitence than done trespass: at the last,"
Shakespeare,"Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil,"
Shakespeare,With them forgive yourself.
Shakespeare,Whilst I remember
Shakespeare,"Her and her virtues, I cannot forget"
Shakespeare,"My blemishes in them, and so still think of"
Shakespeare,"The wrong I did myself, which was so much,"
Shakespeare,That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
Shakespeare,Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
Shakespeare,Bred his hopes out of.
Shakespeare,"True, too true, my lord:"
Shakespeare,"If, one by one, you wedded all the world,"
Shakespeare,"Or from the all that are took something good,"
Shakespeare,"To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd"
Shakespeare,Would be unparallel'd.
Shakespeare,I think so. Kill'd!
Shakespeare,She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
Shakespeare,"Sorely, to say I did, it is as bitter"
Shakespeare,"Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,"
Shakespeare,Say so but seldom.
Shakespeare,"Not at all, good lady:"
Shakespeare,You might have spoken a thousand things that would
Shakespeare,Have done the time more benefit and graced
Shakespeare,Your kindness better.
Shakespeare,You are one of those
Shakespeare,Would have him wed again.
Shakespeare,"If you would not so,"
Shakespeare,"You pity not the state, nor the remembrance"
Shakespeare,"Of his most sovereign name, consider little"
Shakespeare,"What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,"
Shakespeare,May drop upon his kingdom and devour
Shakespeare,Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
Shakespeare,Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
Shakespeare,"What holier than, for royalty's repair,"
Shakespeare,"For present comfort and for future good,"
Shakespeare,To bless the bed of majesty again
Shakespeare,With a sweet fellow to't?
Shakespeare,"There is none worthy,"
Shakespeare,"Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods"
Shakespeare,"Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes,"
Shakespeare,"For has not the divine Apollo said,"
Shakespeare,"Is't not the tenor of his oracle,"
Shakespeare,That King Leontes shall not have an heir
Shakespeare,"Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,"
Shakespeare,Is all as monstrous to our human reason
Shakespeare,As my Antigonus to break his grave
Shakespeare,"And come again to me, who, on my life,"
Shakespeare,Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
Shakespeare,"My lord should to the heavens be contrary,"
Shakespeare,Oppose against their wills.
Shakespeare,To LEONTES
Shakespeare,"Care not for issue,"
Shakespeare,The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
Shakespeare,"Left his to the worthiest, so his successor"
Shakespeare,Was like to be the best.
Shakespeare,"Good Paulina,"
Shakespeare,"Who hast the memory of Hermione,"
Shakespeare,"I know, in honour, O, that ever I"
Shakespeare,"Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,"
Shakespeare,"I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,"
Shakespeare,Have taken treasure from her lips--
Shakespeare,And left them
Shakespeare,More rich for what they yielded.
Shakespeare,Thou speak'st truth.
Shakespeare,"No more such wives, therefore, no wife: one worse,"
Shakespeare,"And better used, would make her sainted spirit"
Shakespeare,"Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,"
Shakespeare,"Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,"
Shakespeare,"And begin, 'Why to me?'"
Shakespeare,"Had she such power,"
Shakespeare,She had just cause.
Shakespeare,"She had, and would incense me"
Shakespeare,To murder her I married.
Shakespeare,I should so.
Shakespeare,"Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark"
Shakespeare,"Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't"
Shakespeare,"You chose her, then I'ld shriek, that even your ears"
Shakespeare,"Should rift to hear me, and the words that follow'd"
Shakespeare,Should be 'Remember mine.'
Shakespeare,"Stars, stars,"
Shakespeare,"And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife,"
Shakespeare,"I'll have no wife, Paulina."
Shakespeare,Will you swear
Shakespeare,Never to marry but by my free leave?
Shakespeare,"Never, Paulina, so be blest my spirit!"
Shakespeare,"Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath."
Shakespeare,You tempt him over-much.
Shakespeare,"Unless another,"
Shakespeare,"As like Hermione as is her picture,"
Shakespeare,Affront his eye.
Shakespeare,"Good madam,--"
Shakespeare,"Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,"
Shakespeare,"No remedy, but you will,--give me the office"
Shakespeare,To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
Shakespeare,"As was your former, but she shall be such"
Shakespeare,"As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,"
Shakespeare,it should take joy
Shakespeare,To see her in your arms.
Shakespeare,"My true Paulina,"
Shakespeare,We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.
Shakespeare,That
Shakespeare,"Shall be when your first queen's again in breath,"
Shakespeare,Never till then.
Shakespeare,"One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,"
Shakespeare,"Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she"
Shakespeare,"The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access"
Shakespeare,To your high presence.
Shakespeare,What with him? he comes not
Shakespeare,"Like to his father's greatness: his approach,"
Shakespeare,"So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us"
Shakespeare,"'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced"
Shakespeare,By need and accident. What train?
Shakespeare,"But few,"
Shakespeare,And those but mean.
Shakespeare,"His princess, say you, with him?"
Shakespeare,"Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,"
Shakespeare,That e'er the sun shone bright on.
Shakespeare,"O Hermione,"
Shakespeare,As every present time doth boast itself
Shakespeare,"Above a better gone, so must thy grave"
Shakespeare,"Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself"
Shakespeare,"Have said and writ so, but your writing now"
Shakespeare,"Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,"
Shakespeare,"Nor was not to be equall'd,'--thus your verse"
Shakespeare,"Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,"
Shakespeare,To say you have seen a better.
Shakespeare,"Pardon, madam:"
Shakespeare,"The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--"
Shakespeare,"The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,"
Shakespeare,"Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,"
Shakespeare,"Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal"
Shakespeare,"Of all professors else, make proselytes"
Shakespeare,Of who she but bid follow.
Shakespeare,How! not women?
Shakespeare,"Women will love her, that she is a woman"
Shakespeare,"More worth than any man, men, that she is"
Shakespeare,The rarest of all women.
Shakespeare,"Go, Cleomenes,"
Shakespeare,"Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,"
Shakespeare,"Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange"
Shakespeare,Exeunt CLEOMENES and others
Shakespeare,He thus should steal upon us.
Shakespeare,"Had our prince,"
Shakespeare,"Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd"
Shakespeare,Well with this lord: there was not full a month
Shakespeare,Between their births.
Shakespeare,"Prithee, no more, cease, thou know'st"
Shakespeare,"He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,"
Shakespeare,"When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches"
Shakespeare,Will bring me to consider that which may
Shakespeare,Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
Shakespeare,"Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA"
Shakespeare,"Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince,"
Shakespeare,"For she did print your royal father off,"
Shakespeare,"Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,"
Shakespeare,"Your father's image is so hit in you,"
Shakespeare,"His very air, that I should call you brother,"
Shakespeare,"As I did him, and speak of something wildly"
Shakespeare,By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
Shakespeare,"And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!"
Shakespeare,"I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth"
Shakespeare,Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
Shakespeare,"You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--"
Shakespeare,"All mine own folly--the society,"
Shakespeare,"Amity too, of your brave father, whom,"
Shakespeare,"Though bearing misery, I desire my life"
Shakespeare,Once more to look on him.
Shakespeare,By his command
Shakespeare,Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
Shakespeare,"Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,"
Shakespeare,"Can send his brother: and, but infirmity"
Shakespeare,Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
Shakespeare,"His wish'd ability, he had himself"
Shakespeare,The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
Shakespeare,"Measured to look upon you, whom he loves--"
Shakespeare,He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
Shakespeare,And those that bear them living.
Shakespeare,"O my brother,"
Shakespeare,Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
Shakespeare,"Afresh within me, and these thy offices,"
Shakespeare,"So rarely kind, are as interpreters"
Shakespeare,"Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,"
Shakespeare,As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
Shakespeare,"Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,"
Shakespeare,"At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,"
Shakespeare,"To greet a man not worth her pains, much less"
Shakespeare,The adventure of her person?
Shakespeare,She came from Libya.
Shakespeare,"Where the warlike Smalus,"
Shakespeare,"That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?"
Shakespeare,"Most royal sir, from thence, from him, whose daughter"
Shakespeare,"His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,"
Shakespeare,"A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,"
Shakespeare,To execute the charge my father gave me
Shakespeare,For visiting your highness: my best train
Shakespeare,"I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd,"
Shakespeare,"Who for Bohemia bend, to signify"
Shakespeare,"Not only my success in Libya, sir,"
Shakespeare,But my arrival and my wife's in safety
Shakespeare,Here where we are.
Shakespeare,The blessed gods
Shakespeare,Purge all infection from our air whilst you
Shakespeare,"Do climate here! You have a holy father,"
Shakespeare,"A graceful gentleman, against whose person,"
Shakespeare,"So sacred as it is, I have done sin:"
Shakespeare,"For which the heavens, taking angry note,"
Shakespeare,"Have left me issueless, and your father's blest,"
Shakespeare,"As he from heaven merits it, with you"
Shakespeare,"Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,"
Shakespeare,"Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,"
Shakespeare,Such goodly things as you!
Shakespeare,"That which I shall report will bear no credit,"
Shakespeare,"Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,"
Shakespeare,"Bohemia greets you from himself by me,"
Shakespeare,"Desires you to attach his son, who has--"
Shakespeare,His dignity and duty both cast off--
Shakespeare,"Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with"
Shakespeare,A shepherd's daughter.
Shakespeare,Where's Bohemia? speak.
Shakespeare,"Here in your city, I now came from him:"
Shakespeare,"I speak amazedly, and it becomes"
Shakespeare,My marvel and my message. To your court
Shakespeare,"Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,"
Shakespeare,"Of this fair couple, meets he on the way"
Shakespeare,The father of this seeming lady and
Shakespeare,"Her brother, having both their country quitted"
Shakespeare,With this young prince.
Shakespeare,"Camillo has betray'd me,"
Shakespeare,Whose honour and whose honesty till now
Shakespeare,Endured all weathers.
Shakespeare,Lay't so to his charge:
Shakespeare,He's with the king your father.
Shakespeare,Who? Camillo?
Shakespeare,"Camillo, sir, I spake with him, who now"
Shakespeare,Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
Shakespeare,"Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth,"
Shakespeare,Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
Shakespeare,"Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them"
Shakespeare,With divers deaths in death.
Shakespeare,O my poor father!
Shakespeare,"The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have"
Shakespeare,Our contract celebrated.
Shakespeare,You are married?
Shakespeare,"We are not, sir, nor are we like to be,"
Shakespeare,"The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:"
Shakespeare,The odds for high and low's alike.
Shakespeare,Is this the daughter of a king?
Shakespeare,"She is,"
Shakespeare,When once she is my wife.
Shakespeare,That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
Shakespeare,"Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,"
Shakespeare,"Most sorry, you have broken from his liking"
Shakespeare,"Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry"
Shakespeare,"Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,"
Shakespeare,That you might well enjoy her.
Shakespeare,"Dear, look up:"
Shakespeare,"Though Fortune, visible an enemy,"
Shakespeare,"Should chase us with my father, power no jot"
Shakespeare,"Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,"
Shakespeare,Remember since you owed no more to time
Shakespeare,"Than I do now: with thought of such affections,"
Shakespeare,"Step forth mine advocate, at your request"
Shakespeare,My father will grant precious things as trifles.
Shakespeare,"Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,"
Shakespeare,Which he counts but a trifle.
Shakespeare,Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
Shakespeare,"'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes"
Shakespeare,Than what you look on now.
Shakespeare,"I thought of her,"
Shakespeare,Even in these looks I made.
Shakespeare,But your petition
Shakespeare,Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
Shakespeare,"Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,"
Shakespeare,I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
Shakespeare,"I now go toward him, therefore follow me"
Shakespeare,"And mark what way I make: come, good my lord."
Shakespeare,SCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.
Shakespeare,Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman
Shakespeare,"Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?"
Shakespeare,"I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old"
Shakespeare,shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
Shakespeare,"whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all"
Shakespeare,"commanded out of the chamber, only this methought I"
Shakespeare,"heard the shepherd say, he found the child."
Shakespeare,I would most gladly know the issue of it.
Shakespeare,"I make a broken delivery of the business, but the"
Shakespeare,changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
Shakespeare,"very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with"
Shakespeare,"staring on one another, to tear the cases of their"
Shakespeare,"eyes, there was speech in their dumbness, language"
Shakespeare,"in their very gesture, they looked as they had heard"
Shakespeare,"of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable"
Shakespeare,"passion of wonder appeared in them, but the wisest"
Shakespeare,"beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not"
Shakespeare,"say if the importance were joy or sorrow, but in the"
Shakespeare,"extremity of the one, it must needs be."
Shakespeare,Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
Shakespeare,"The news, Rogero?"
Shakespeare,"Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled, the"
Shakespeare,king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
Shakespeare,broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
Shakespeare,cannot be able to express it.
Shakespeare,Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
Shakespeare,"deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news"
Shakespeare,"which is called true is so like an old tale, that"
Shakespeare,the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
Shakespeare,found his heir?
Shakespeare,"Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by"
Shakespeare,circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
Shakespeare,"see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle"
Shakespeare,"of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,"
Shakespeare,the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
Shakespeare,"know to be his character, the majesty of the"
Shakespeare,"creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection"
Shakespeare,"of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,"
Shakespeare,and many other evidences proclaim her with all
Shakespeare,certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
Shakespeare,the meeting of the two kings?
Shakespeare,"Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,"
Shakespeare,cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
Shakespeare,"joy crown another, so and in such manner that it"
Shakespeare,"seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their"
Shakespeare,"joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,"
Shakespeare,"holding up of hands, with countenances of such"
Shakespeare,"distraction that they were to be known by garment,"
Shakespeare,"not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of"
Shakespeare,"himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that"
Shakespeare,"joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,"
Shakespeare,"thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness, then"
Shakespeare,"embraces his son-in-law, then again worries he his"
Shakespeare,"daughter with clipping her, now he thanks the old"
Shakespeare,"shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten"
Shakespeare,conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
Shakespeare,"another encounter, which lames report to follow it"
Shakespeare,and undoes description to do it.
Shakespeare,"What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried"
Shakespeare,hence the child?
Shakespeare,"Like an old tale still, which will have matter to"
Shakespeare,"rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear"
Shakespeare,open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
Shakespeare,"avouches the shepherd's son, who has not only his"
Shakespeare,"innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a"
Shakespeare,handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.
Shakespeare,What became of his bark and his followers?
Shakespeare,Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
Shakespeare,in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
Shakespeare,instruments which aided to expose the child were
Shakespeare,"even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble"
Shakespeare,combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
Shakespeare,Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
Shakespeare,"her husband, another elevated that the oracle was"
Shakespeare,"fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,"
Shakespeare,"and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin"
Shakespeare,her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
Shakespeare,of losing.
Shakespeare,The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
Shakespeare,"kings and princes, for by such was it acted."
Shakespeare,One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
Shakespeare,"angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not"
Shakespeare,"the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's"
Shakespeare,"death, with the manner how she came to't bravely"
Shakespeare,"confessed and lamented by the king, how"
Shakespeare,"attentiveness wounded his daughter, till, from one"
Shakespeare,"sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'"
Shakespeare,"I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my"
Shakespeare,heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
Shakespeare,"colour, some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world"
Shakespeare,"could have seen 't, the woe had been universal."
Shakespeare,Are they returned to the court?
Shakespeare,"No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,"
Shakespeare,"which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many"
Shakespeare,years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
Shakespeare,"Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself"
Shakespeare,"eternity and could put breath into his work, would"
Shakespeare,"beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her"
Shakespeare,ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
Shakespeare,they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
Shakespeare,answer: thither with all greediness of affection
Shakespeare,"are they gone, and there they intend to sup."
Shakespeare,"I thought she had some great matter there in hand,"
Shakespeare,"for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever"
Shakespeare,"since the death of Hermione, visited that removed"
Shakespeare,house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
Shakespeare,the rejoicing?
Shakespeare,Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
Shakespeare,every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
Shakespeare,our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
Shakespeare,Let's along.
Shakespeare,Exeunt Gentlemen
Shakespeare,"Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,"
Shakespeare,would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
Shakespeare,man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
Shakespeare,them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
Shakespeare,"at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,"
Shakespeare,"so he then took her to be, who began to be much"
Shakespeare,"sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of"
Shakespeare,"weather continuing, this mystery remained"
Shakespeare,"undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me, for had I"
Shakespeare,"been the finder out of this secret, it would not"
Shakespeare,have relished among my other discredits.
Shakespeare,Enter Shepherd and Clown
Shakespeare,"Here come those I have done good to against my will,"
Shakespeare,and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.
Shakespeare,"Come, boy, I am past moe children, but thy sons and"
Shakespeare,daughters will be all gentlemen born.
Shakespeare,"You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me"
Shakespeare,"this other day, because I was no gentleman born."
Shakespeare,See you these clothes? say you see them not and
Shakespeare,think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
Shakespeare,these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
Shakespeare,"lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born."
Shakespeare,"I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born."
Shakespeare,"Ay, and have been so any time these four hours."
Shakespeare,"And so have I, boy."
Shakespeare,So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
Shakespeare,"father, for the king's son took me by the hand, and"
Shakespeare,"called me brother, and then the two kings called my"
Shakespeare,"father brother, and then the prince my brother and"
Shakespeare,"the princess my sister called my father father, and"
Shakespeare,"so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like"
Shakespeare,tears that ever we shed.
Shakespeare,"We may live, son, to shed many more."
Shakespeare,"Ay, or else 'twere hard luck, being in so"
Shakespeare,preposterous estate as we are.
Shakespeare,"I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the"
Shakespeare,faults I have committed to your worship and to give
Shakespeare,me your good report to the prince my master.
Shakespeare,"Prithee, son, do, for we must be gentle, now we are"
Shakespeare,Thou wilt amend thy life?
Shakespeare,"Ay, an it like your good worship."
Shakespeare,Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
Shakespeare,art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.
Shakespeare,"You may say it, but not swear it."
Shakespeare,"Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and"
Shakespeare,"franklins say it, I'll swear it."
Shakespeare,"How if it be false, son?"
Shakespeare,"If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear"
Shakespeare,it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
Shakespeare,the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
Shakespeare,"that thou wilt not be drunk, but I know thou art no"
Shakespeare,tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
Shakespeare,"drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst"
Shakespeare,be a tall fellow of thy hands.
Shakespeare,"I will prove so, sir, to my power."
Shakespeare,"Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not"
Shakespeare,"wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not"
Shakespeare,"being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings"
Shakespeare,"and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the"
Shakespeare,"queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy"
Shakespeare,good masters.
Shakespeare,SCENE III. A chapel in PAULINA'S house.
Shakespeare,"Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA, CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants"
Shakespeare,"O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort"
Shakespeare,That I have had of thee!
Shakespeare,"What, sovereign sir,"
Shakespeare,I did not well I meant well. All my services
Shakespeare,"You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,"
Shakespeare,With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
Shakespeare,"Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,"
Shakespeare,"It is a surplus of your grace, which never"
Shakespeare,My life may last to answer.
Shakespeare,"O Paulina,"
Shakespeare,We honour you with trouble: but we came
Shakespeare,To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
Shakespeare,"Have we pass'd through, not without much content"
Shakespeare,"In many singularities, but we saw not"
Shakespeare,"That which my daughter came to look upon,"
Shakespeare,The statue of her mother.
Shakespeare,"As she lived peerless,"
Shakespeare,"So her dead likeness, I do well believe,"
Shakespeare,Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
Shakespeare,"Or hand of man hath done, therefore I keep it"
Shakespeare,"Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare"
Shakespeare,To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
Shakespeare,"Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well."
Shakespeare,"PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue"
Shakespeare,"I like your silence, it the more shows off"
Shakespeare,"Your wonder: but yet speak, first, you, my liege,"
Shakespeare,Comes it not something near?
Shakespeare,Her natural posture!
Shakespeare,"Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed"
Shakespeare,"Thou art Hermione, or rather, thou art she"
Shakespeare,"In thy not chiding, for she was as tender"
Shakespeare,"As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,"
Shakespeare,"Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing"
Shakespeare,So aged as this seems.
Shakespeare,"O, not by much."
Shakespeare,"So much the more our carver's excellence,"
Shakespeare,Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
Shakespeare,As she lived now.
Shakespeare,"As now she might have done,"
Shakespeare,"So much to my good comfort, as it is"
Shakespeare,"Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,"
Shakespeare,"Even with such life of majesty, warm life,"
Shakespeare,"As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!"
Shakespeare,I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
Shakespeare,"For being more stone than it? O royal piece,"
Shakespeare,"There's magic in thy majesty, which has"
Shakespeare,My evils conjured to remembrance and
Shakespeare,"From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,"
Shakespeare,Standing like stone with thee.
Shakespeare,"And give me leave,"
Shakespeare,"And do not say 'tis superstition, that"
Shakespeare,"I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,"
Shakespeare,"Dear queen, that ended when I but began,"
Shakespeare,Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
Shakespeare,"O, patience!"
Shakespeare,"The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry."
Shakespeare,"My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,"
Shakespeare,"Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,"
Shakespeare,"So many summers dry, scarce any joy"
Shakespeare,"Did ever so long live, no sorrow"
Shakespeare,But kill'd itself much sooner.
Shakespeare,"Dear my brother,"
Shakespeare,Let him that was the cause of this have power
Shakespeare,To take off so much grief from you as he
Shakespeare,Will piece up in himself.
Shakespeare,If I had thought the sight of my poor image
Shakespeare,"Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--"
Shakespeare,I'ld not have show'd it.
Shakespeare,Do not draw the curtain.
Shakespeare,"No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy"
Shakespeare,May think anon it moves.
Shakespeare,"Let be, let be."
Shakespeare,"Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--"
Shakespeare,"What was he that did make it? See, my lord,"
Shakespeare,Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
Shakespeare,Did verily bear blood?
Shakespeare,Masterly done:
Shakespeare,The very life seems warm upon her lip.
Shakespeare,"The fixture of her eye has motion in't,"
Shakespeare,As we are mock'd with art.
Shakespeare,I'll draw the curtain:
Shakespeare,My lord's almost so far transported that
Shakespeare,He'll think anon it lives.
Shakespeare,"O sweet Paulina,"
Shakespeare,Make me to think so twenty years together!
Shakespeare,No settled senses of the world can match
Shakespeare,The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.
Shakespeare,"I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but"
Shakespeare,I could afflict you farther.
Shakespeare,"Do, Paulina,"
Shakespeare,For this affliction has a taste as sweet
Shakespeare,"As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,"
Shakespeare,There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
Shakespeare,"Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,"
Shakespeare,For I will kiss her.
Shakespeare,"Good my lord, forbear:"
Shakespeare,"The ruddiness upon her lip is wet,"
Shakespeare,"You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own"
Shakespeare,With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
Shakespeare,"No, not these twenty years."
Shakespeare,So long could I
Shakespeare,"Stand by, a looker on."
Shakespeare,"Either forbear,"
Shakespeare,"Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you"
Shakespeare,"For more amazement. If you can behold it,"
Shakespeare,"I'll make the statue move indeed, descend"
Shakespeare,"And take you by the hand, but then you'll think--"
Shakespeare,Which I protest against--I am assisted
Shakespeare,By wicked powers.
Shakespeare,"What you can make her do,"
Shakespeare,"I am content to look on: what to speak,"
Shakespeare,"I am content to hear, for 'tis as easy"
Shakespeare,To make her speak as move.
Shakespeare,It is required
Shakespeare,"You do awake your faith. Then all stand still,"
Shakespeare,On: those that think it is unlawful business
Shakespeare,"I am about, let them depart."
Shakespeare,Proceed:
Shakespeare,No foot shall stir.
Shakespeare,"Music, awake her, strike!"
Shakespeare,"'Tis time, descend, be stone no more, approach,"
Shakespeare,"Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,"
Shakespeare,"I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,"
Shakespeare,"Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him"
Shakespeare,Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
Shakespeare,HERMIONE comes down
Shakespeare,"Start not, her actions shall be holy as"
Shakespeare,You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
Shakespeare,"Until you see her die again, for then"
Shakespeare,"You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:"
Shakespeare,"When she was young you woo'd her, now in age"
Shakespeare,Is she become the suitor?
Shakespeare,"O, she's warm!"
Shakespeare,"If this be magic, let it be an art"
Shakespeare,Lawful as eating.
Shakespeare,She embraces him.
Shakespeare,She hangs about his neck:
Shakespeare,If she pertain to life let her speak too.
Shakespeare,"Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,"
Shakespeare,Or how stolen from the dead.
Shakespeare,"That she is living,"
Shakespeare,"Were it but told you, should be hooted at"
Shakespeare,"Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,"
Shakespeare,Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
Shakespeare,"Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel"
Shakespeare,"And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady,"
Shakespeare,Our Perdita is found.
Shakespeare,"You gods, look down"
Shakespeare,And from your sacred vials pour your graces
Shakespeare,"Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own."
Shakespeare,Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
Shakespeare,"Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,"
Shakespeare,Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
Shakespeare,"Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved"
Shakespeare,Myself to see the issue.
Shakespeare,"There's time enough for that,"
Shakespeare,Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
Shakespeare,"Your joys with like relation. Go together,"
Shakespeare,"You precious winners all, your exultation"
Shakespeare,"Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,"
Shakespeare,Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
Shakespeare,"My mate, that's never to be found again,"
Shakespeare,Lament till I am lost.
Shakespeare,"O, peace, Paulina!"
Shakespeare,"Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,"
Shakespeare,"As I by thine a wife: this is a match,"
Shakespeare,"And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine,"
Shakespeare,"But how, is to be question'd, for I saw her,"
Shakespeare,"As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many"
Shakespeare,A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
Shakespeare,"For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee"
Shakespeare,"An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,"
Shakespeare,"And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty"
Shakespeare,Is richly noted and here justified
Shakespeare,"By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place."
Shakespeare,"What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,"
Shakespeare,That e'er I put between your holy looks
Shakespeare,"My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,"
Shakespeare,"And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,"
Shakespeare,"Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,"
Shakespeare,"Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely"
Shakespeare,Each one demand an answer to his part
Shakespeare,Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
Shakespeare,We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.
Trump,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to Vice President Pence. He's a good guy. We've done a great job together. And Merry Christmas, Michigan. Thank you, Michigan. What a victory we had in Michigan. What a victory was that. One of the greats. Was that the greatest evening? But I'm thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of Christmas, the greatness of America and the glory of God. Thank you very much. And did you notice that everybody is saying Merry Christmas again? Did you notice? Saying Merry Christmas. I remember when I first started this beautiful trip, this beautiful journey, I just said to the First Lady, ""You are so lucky. I took you on this fantastic journey. It's so much fun. They want to impeach you. They want to do worse than that."" By the way, by the way, by the way, it doesn't really feel like we're being impeached. The country is doing better than ever before. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong. And we have tremendous support in the Republican Party like we've never had before. Nobody's ever had this kind of support. But this sacred season, our country is thriving and it's thriving truly like it has never, it has never happened before to the extent what's happening now. And by the way, your state, because of us, not because of local government, but because of us, because of the job that we've done. Because I understand she's not fixing those potholes. That's what the word is. It was all about roads and they want to raise those gasoline taxes on you. We don't want to do that. But she's not fixing the potholes. But Michigan's had the best year it's ever had. Best year it's ever had. And that's because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they're coming in from Japan and they're coming in from a lot of other places. Look what's happening. And you know, I don't know if you know this, but probably 10 years ago I was honored. I was the Man Of The Year by I think somebody, whoever. I was the Man Of The Year in Michigan. Can you believe it? Long time. And that was long before I ever decided to do this. I was happy. I had a beautiful life. What the hell did I do this for? But look how we're doing. Do we love it? I love it. But anyway, I was the Man Of The Year and probably close to 10 years ago and I came to Michigan. He said, ""You're still the Man Of The Year."" Thank you. Who said that? Thank you. So I came in and I remember the speech so well. I said, ""Why are you allowing them to steal your car companies? Why are you allowing them to go to Mexico and to go from China where they come in from China, they build them in China, they sell them into our country with no tax and you lose your jobs, you lose your factories, the companies leave and you get nothing. Why are they lying?"" I asked that a long time ago and we stopped it. We've stopped it. And you see that. And we just made the USMCA. We're getting rid of NAFTA, which I think is the worst trade deal ever. And it's very exciting. It's a great deal. It's a great deal. It's going to stop exactly what we were just talking about. It makes it very, very prohibitive. They can do it, but they've got to pay a hell of a big price to do it. And history has proven that stops them. But we have a great USMCA that we negotiated with Mexico, with Canada. Now, from the standpoint of the farmers, you know what's going on. We had tremendous trade barriers in Canada. We had attacks on dairy products, 297% tariff, nobody talked about it, with Canada. And we had some really bad things with Mexico. We now have a wonderful deal. And if we didn't have a good deal, you know what I would have done what? What? I would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it, right? That would have been it. Unfortunately the deal's been sitting with Nancy Pelosi for a long time and what happened? And she had a lot of pressure, especially from manufacturing areas, farm areas, a lot of pressure to sign it. So here's what happens. So I get along with labor. I had a lot of union labor vote for me, tremendous amount of labor. In New York where I come from, we have a lot of unions. And that's okay. That's fine. So we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed, we'll give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal. And now you have the Democrats trying to take credit for this deal and that's okay. Whatever it takes. For seven months, it sits. They don't do anything. We give. And by the way, I spoke to the unions the day before I say, ""Fellows, you got to get it done."" And union labor loves me and I love you too sir. I love you too sir. So we have a great deal with Mexico, with Canada. And it is true. I say it out loud because I say it to them right now. If they ever wanted to break the deal, that's okay. If somebody wants to break a deal with me, you always have to have an alternative, right? And this country, the deals we made, we did a deal with South Korea. That's great. We did a deal with Japan, 40 billion dollar deal with Japan. It was just a little piece of a deal. Okay? That was a piece of a deal. And I said to Japan, ""Look, you got to make this deal or we're going to put a 20% tariff on the cars. And that's more money than anything we're talking about."" That's all right. That's all right. That's all right. Get her out. Ger her out of here. Oh well. You're about to hear the greatest speech you've ever heard. And that's going to be the publicity because all the fake news back there will say massive riot… Massive riots. Fake news. But seriously, look, look, look, they won't say it. They won't say it, because when we have protesters all in favor, they don't talk about it, but there's a slob. There's a real slob. Wait, wait a minute. She'll get hell when she gets back home with mom. But she made… Look, she screams a little bit. And you know what I like to do? Avoid them. Because I'll tell you the big problem. I could hardly hear her. What happens is all of you people go crazy. Look, look, look, and the place. Okay, so there's one disgusting person who made… Wait, wait, who made a… I wouldn't say this, but made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger right? Now they won't say that, the fake news, they won't say it. If one of us did that, it would be like the biggest story ever. I think it's terrible. And I'll tell you the other thing, I don't know who the security company is, but the police came up, but they want to be so politically correct so they don't grab her wrist lightly and get her out. They say, ""Oh, would you please come? Would you please come with me?"" Sure. ""Ma'am, would you?"" And then she gives the guy the finger and he, ""Oh, Oh."" You got to get a little bit stronger than that, folks. And they… . Making another group of tariffs, seven and a half percent. This gives us a lot of currency to do the phase two deal, which they want to start, but we're taking in billions of dollars and to help the farmers who were targeted, 16 billion and 12 billion the previous year, helps the farmers. So you know what we do, out of that big check that we get, all that money flows into the treasury. Out of the big check, we gave the farmers 16 billion dollars and 12 billion for the previous year. And you know, the incredible thing, and I was with a lot of farmers. I was with a group of 36 farmers at the White House. You know what they said to me? I said, ""Don't worry about it. We're going to take care of you guys."" And I used a bad word. You know what word I used? We're going to get you a subsidy. And they said this two years ago, I said, ""How much were you targeted for?"" This was the first year. ""12 billion, sir."" The second year was 16. They were target. That's what they didn't get from China. So I said, ""It's all right, we're going to give you a subsidy of the same and we're going to take it out of the tariffs and we're going to have billions and billions of dollars left over."" And they said, ""Sir, we don't want money. We just want a level playing field."" I've never seen that before. I've never seen that before. So we will have invested in our military, since I'm here, which is less than three years. Our military, by the way, in all due respect to the previous two administrations, our military was depleted. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. We had fighter jets that were 35 years old. We had planes that were 60 years… You heard where the father flew them, the grandfather flew them, and now the young son comes in. We've got the best equipment in the world now. Spent two and a half trillion dollars, made in the USA. Two and a half trillion. We will shortly. That'll be all finished. We're going to have the greatest… Now we have the best planes. We're going to have the best ships. We're building a lot of ships now. We're building the most powerful weapons in the world. Now, we don't want to even talk about it. We never want to use them. But you know, the way we're not going to have to use them is if we have them. We're building submarines, the power of which nobody's ever seen before. Nobody's ever seen before. It's funny, we have these companies come in. I like to make good deals. You like to make good deals. That's what we do, right? So these really countries that come in, prime ministers, presidents, sometimes dictators, those we can't deal with too much. ""Sir, we'd like to buy a nuclear submarine."" I say, ""No thanks."" I turn them all down. You have no idea how many people… But we're building some of the… They're the most powerful weapons ever made by man or womankind. I say mankind and womankind. They can definitely fight. They're the real deal. These guys, so good looking. I said, ""You could be a movie star. Go to Hollywood."" ""No sir. I like doing what I'm doing."" So I said to these guys, you going to see, just like central casting, I said, I said, ""Fellas, how good is this plane?"" They said, ""Sir, it's great."" ""Why?"" ""Because the enemy can't see it."" That helps. Stealth. It's actually called super stealth. So I said, ""You mean they can't see, so you shoot at them but they can't…"" He said, ""They have no idea where we are, sir."" I said, ""That sounds good to me."" Nobody does it. Nobody can do it. We have the whole thing and we bought in a lot of those planes, we bought in a lot of great stuff. And I won't tell you the story, but very early on I thought we were going to have a problem someplace, and one of the generals came up to me and said, ""Sir, don't go. Don't do it."" ""Why?"" ""We don't have the ammunition."" And I said two things. I never want to hear a President. Right? We never want to have a President hear that again, nor do we want a President to have to go through the crap that we were going through back then. But, another thing we did, which to me is such an incredible thing to have done. It's such an honor. So our last US Armed Forces, the last branch was the Air Force, right? That was many, many decades ago. We are now building and we have now gotten funding for the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, The Space Force. So I'll be able to tell my kids someday and everybody else, ""See that Space Force? That was my baby."" And you think that was easy? That's not easy. Because you have Democrats that do not like our military. They do not like our military. And we did something yesterday, because for three years I would see people that run… Incredible people, the heads of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country. And every year they'd come in and they'd be looking for help. They needed help and they do need help with it and it's great and they do an incredible job. So many great schools, but they need help. And every year they'd have to come and come. I got to know them actually. I said, ""The only bad thing is you won't see me too much anymore."" Because we just provided record funding for a nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. And it's longterm, they're not going to have to come. So I said, ""Look, we could do it where we do it every year or we'll do what we have. What do you want?"" They said, ""Let us just have it."" So we'll miss them. But they are great people. They've done an incredible job. And our extraordinary jobs boom, which created another 266,000 jobs last month, and then you add the undercount from the previous two months, you're close to 300,000 jobs. And they said, if you're a business watcher which I am, I love watching business, but they said they were guessing, could be 70,000, could be 80,000, maybe 90, maybe 110, somebody said. Then the number comes out, 266,000 with an adjustment. Remember about four months ago when we had one little period, right? We had one little period where there was a little downturn. They said, ""Oh, Oh, we think we're going into a recession."" I said, ""Don't worry about it."" ""We think we're going into a recession."" They were willing to lose their wealth. They were willing for this stocks and whatever the hell they own, what do you guys own back there? Let it go. They'll go bust. They don't care. Anything to get rid of us. Not me, us. And you know what? Then all of a sudden, and now for the last couple of weeks, we've set brand new records in the history of the various stock markets. So, as of yesterday, we've had 133 record days in the stock market now, and that's in less than three years. So when I see that I don't care because I don't… I'm not allowed to have stock. I can't have stock. They consider it a conflict of interest and that I can understand. I agree. I can. But you know what? I'll tell you what. What I see, I see tremendous job growth because we're setting records. But you know what I also see? The 401ks where people are up 90%, they're up 97%, they're up 82%. I tell you the story all the time. I mean, I have people coming up to me, and a man came up, a policeman. I've told this story, but I've had many, so many times, but this guy in particular, because it was early and that was a year ago. That was a long time ago. Right now it's much higher than that. But he said, ""Sir, I want to thank you. My wife thinks I'm a loser. All my life, we never did well with the 401ks, with stocks. Everything I invested, I'm up 72%, sir. She thinks I'm a financial genius. She's so in love with me. She so in love."" He said, ""She said, ‘Darling, I think you're one of the greatest investors. Why don't you do this professionally?' And I don't even know what I'm doing, sir. I just have all these stocks."" So I just wanted to tell you, I look at a 401k, who has 401ks here? So that's what I see. I don't care about the rich ones. I care about everybody. I care. I care about everybody actually. Ford motor company just announced that it is investing 1.5 billion dollars into auto factories in the Detroit area, creating another 3000 Michigan jobs. And that's on top of the many other investments we've gotten from Japanese companies, car companies, and other companies. But they're all coming in and a lot of them are coming to Michigan. And I say, ""Hey, go to Michigan."" Sometimes they'll go south and that's okay, whatever. I want them in this country. But ideally I want to fill them up. We're doing so well in Michigan with the auto companies. Now you're back. You're back. So, you're back. Very proud of you. Very proud of you. But while we're creating jobs, fighting for Michigan workers, and achieving numbers that you've never seen before, incredible victories for the American people are happening. The radical left in Congress is consumed with hatred and envy and rage. You see what's going on? I'll tell you, these people are crazy. You ever hear, ""It's the economy, stupid."" You know that was Clinton's saying. If you have a good economy. I have the greatest economy in the history of this country and nobody talks about it. Nobody talks about it. If you're a Democrat, they say, "" Oh, it's the economy…"" If the economy's any good. And let me just tell you a little secret. If crooked Hillary would've won, your economy would have crashed. You were going down. The regulations were taking it down. The taxes were taking it down, instead of being up 92% or whatever you're up, a lot, you would have been down, you would have been at less than half. It was crashing. For all those people that would say, ""Oh, it's the Obama…"" Let me tell you something. You were dying. And if you look at that first period of a couple of months, it was a disaster, but it was heading south. And as sure as you're standing, and I'm sorry we couldn't get you seats, we didn't have any room. And by the way, 20,000 people outside had to leave. You know? It's so cold outside we told them, ""Don't worry about a screen, go home, go home and watch."" But we had, this is about a 5,500 seat arena. And I said to my people, ""Why so small?"" Are we spoiled? I watch these guys come in like Biden, he has a big rally and they get 93 people show up. No, it's true. I don't understand it. And did you see the new polls from USA Today came out? I'm killing everybody. And they hate me. USA Today hates me. But there's a poll, we're beating everybody. But, so Biden has this rally, they've got 200 seats, but only a small number of people. So you know what they do? They set up a round table. So think of these people. They come in, they think they're going to listen to the speech, they end up sitting on a round table discussing… They must've been happy, right? We don't have enough room for round tables. I'm sorry folks. No, they set up a round table but I think we're doing great. And how do you beat what we've done? With the economy, with our great vets, with choice. You've finally got choice. They've been trying to get it for almost 50 years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. And these people back here? Your seat or stand is better. Right? But you know what? They're going to be much more famous because the cameras can't see you. They can only see them. And the other thing, the cameras, do you ever notice, I go to these stadiums, 25, 30,000 people. They never show the crowd. You know why? Because they don't want to have… If crazy Pocahontas, if crazy Pocahontas goes to the middle of Central Park or whatever. She's in Manhattan. You got me. And people, I mean, I could have, I could have Baron Trump go into Central Park and he'd get a crowd that would be just as… He's 13. He'd get a bigger crowd. But if she has the crowd, ""Oh, these crowds are so big."" I've had crowds over the last couple of weeks. We went to different Pennsylvania, Florida. But I mean thousands and thousands of people can't get into these NBA arenas, right? Big arenas. And we set records at everyone because we use the floor. Thank you. I appreciate it. But we use the floor, right? The basketball court. So we set records at every arena. They never even mention the crowds. They never mention the crowds. It's sort of amazing. You know what? I don't think we've ever had an empty seat from the time I came down the escalator. That's a long time ago. I don't think we've ever had an empty seat. Now what the crooked media does though, if you got like over here, look how packed it is and there's thousands outside, but I… ""Please go home. You're going to catch pneumonia."" But here's the thing. If this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom, those cameras will turn to those two seats and they'll say ""Trump wasn't able to fill up the arena."" I always get nervous when I see some… I know they're coming back. Nobody ever leaves our speeches. Because is there a better place to be in the world than a Trump rally? But every time I see a man get up, I see a beautiful woman with a baby and they're getting up. The baby's going crazy and they're getting up. They're going to take it… But I know they're going to be right back. And I say, ""Fill those two seats. I don't want them to see it."" Because they'll say, ""Couldn't fill up the arena."" These are truly dishonest people. After three years of sinister witch hunts, hoaxes, scams, tonight the House Democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic Americans. Capped off with one of the greatest election evenings in history. Was that the greatest? Remember when they all said, remember when they all said, ""No, no. You can't win Michigan. You can't."" Then I went, I did one in Grand Rapids, right? Grand Rapids. We had 32,000 people that night. It was one o'clock in the morning. That means it was Election Day when I started speaking. Hillary, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Bill Clinton, they did an emergency trip. They did an emergency trip to Michigan at six o'clock. They got here at prime time. They started to speak. She had 500 people. I got here at one o'clock in the morning the next day, which is now Election Day. How many people were there? 32,000 people outside, inside. It was the last speech of Michigan. And they say, ""Well, sir, it's very hard to win Michigan."" I said, ""Why would it be hard?"" Here's the beautiful thing. Everything I told you I've done, but much more so. I said I was going to bring car companies back. I said I was going to bring in… I just hope you people know that. I just hope you know it. But I'll never forget that night. And in all fairness to Bill Clinton, he used to be a friend of mine until I ran for office. I like him, I like him. But he told, you know the way they tried to shut him out, right? Because he's a pro. He's an instinct guy, right? He's instinct. He doesn't need… Right? Because he's a pro. He's an instinct guy, right? He's instinct. He doesn't need polling companies. Who the hell wants him? You know, if you want a polling company, pick up the newspaper. The problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write. They write fake polls. It's true, they write fake polls. You call them suppression polls. You read them and you get depressed, because it looks like you're doing badly. They do that. I think it's almost worse than what they write, and you can't get much worse than what they write. So what happens is Bill Clinton said to Crooked Hillary, his very dishonest wife, Crooked Hillary. Do you think he calls her Crooked Hillary? He might. Maybe he just calls her crooked? He said, ""Crooked, I'm telling you. Crooked, I don't like what I'm seeing in Michigan. I don't like what I'm seeing in Wisconsin."" He said, ""I took the trip to Wisconsin and I'll tell you what, they had those Trump/Pence signs all the way to the convention area, every lawn, every loan. I don't like Wisconsin."" And then he said, ""Oh, don't worry about it."" What the hell does he know? They told him, ""What do you know?"" Remember, they shut him out at the … They didn't want him talking. He was right. I mean, I don't want to cause any problems in the family, but he was right. But he talked about Wisconsin. Then he talked about Michigan. He said, ""Crooked, I'm telling you, Crooked, I don't like what I'm seeing in Michigan. I was in Michigan and I'm telling you, they had those damn signs. I saw some houses where they had four of them on one lawn, and two of them on the car."" And he said, ""You horrible human being. You'd better start listening to me, because you're going to get your ass whooped? And you know what happened? You know what happened? She didn't listen, fortunately. And she didn't come to Michigan enough. And she didn't come to Wisconsin, I think at all, right? Because her polling data looked good. It looked good to me, too. Every time I went there with these crowds. So we won Wisconsin. We won Michigan and the great Ronna McDaniel … where is Ronna? Where is Ronna? Ronna, she was so horrible. I didn't know her, Ronna McDaniel, and she was so aggressive. She kept calling and said, ""Could you please come out to Michigan?"" I said, ""Who the hell are you?"" And I said, ""What do you mean, another trip?"" So anyway, I made, we had these big crowds. I made it again. Then finally I said, two weeks out, I said, ""Ronna, no more. We're going to win it or we're not."" ""Okay."" 00 in the evening for this final deal in Grand Rapids. ""Sir, could you come to Michigan tonight?"" And I thought, I was just about finished. I went to a last great state, and I said, ""It's over."" Now I sit back and I watch, and let's see what happens, right? But she said, ""Could you come to Michigan?"" I said, that is the most aggressive human being I've ever met. And we did it. And we won Michigan. And the word is that we're much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in 2016 in Michigan. You better remember when you walk into … you know, it's November 3rd this time, November 3rd. By the way though, that evening, that incredible evening in November, one of the biggest nights in the history of television. You never hear them say it, so I might as well. That election … and my debates … you see their debates are dying. Who wants to watch Buttigieg, Buttigieg? Buttigieg! You know that you pronounce it they say … I heard some guy saying, ""No, no, because it's an unpronounceable name."" That's why they call him Mayor Pete, right? Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete! I've had you up to here, Mayor Pete. No, Buttigieg is leading. How does … no, you say it this way. You say it … they call him Mayor Pete, because nobody can pronounce his last name. That's the only … people think it says … by the way, you know what? I'm not going to say bad things about him. You know why? I'd love him to win. I thought I knocked off Pocahontas. I did it a year too early, a year too early. I give her credit, she then started to come back. I don't think she's going to make it though. She's gasping. She's gasping for air. But I saw them pronouncing Buttigieg, and they said, ""Here's what you do, boot edge edge."" Say, ""Edge, like the edge of a building. Edge edge,"" Buttigieg. Alfred E. Newman. You got to be older to know what that means. But congressional Democrats are directly attacking 2.3 million Michigan voters who rose up in 2016, won the state, and now the Democrats are very upset. They want to get Michigan back. They just don't know how to do it, because they didn't do a thing for Michigan. They didn't do anything for Michigan. All they did was take away your companies and let them go to Mexico and other places. You know, I don't know if you know it, Mexico has 32% of your car business. You know that, right? Not because of me. They're not moving. But Mexico has … 32% of our car business moved to Mexico. Can you believe this? Before I got there, but that's what I used to talk about. I said, when I was honored that night, I said, ""How do you let this happen? How do you let all these companies leave?"" It used to go, … it's probably maybe the single biggest reason I ran for president. It might be the … and I had a lot of them. Immigration, I had a lot of them, but that may be the single biggest. With today's illegal unconstitutional and partisan impeachment, the do nothing Democrats, and they are do nothing … all they want to do is focus on this, what they could be doing … are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for the American voter. This lawless, partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the Democrat Party. Have you seen my polls in the last four weeks? It's crazy. It's crazy. You know why? Because people, we have an election right down the road. I announced three months ago that I'm running, right? I'll give you a little clue. I announced because I figured once I announce, they'd never impeach, nobody would be so stupid. But they'd been trying to impeach me from day one. They've been trying to impeach me from before I ran, okay? Because if you remember when I ran, I went immediately to number one, never came off number one. We had center stage from day one in the debates. So we had, I don't know, 14, 15 debates. We had a total of 18, actually. People forgot there was one that they never talk about it, but that's okay. But we had 18 people, and I was center stage. And I said, ""Wait a minute, this is no good."" I want odd numbers, because of your center stage, if you have a 10 that means two people are in the middle. So I said, ""Make it 11 or make it nine, or I'm not showing up."" And generally they did it, because we were way ahead from the beginning. But I made a lot of great friends out of that group, and many of them are good friends today. Although you wouldn't know it based on the … they say that was the meanest … that was a pretty mean primary, you got to say. Wasn't that fun? I liked it. Through their depraved actions today, Crazy Nancy Pelosi's House Democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame, and it really is. It's a disgrace. Democrat lawmakers do not believe you have the right to select your own president. They think that the Washington swamp, which we believe it or not, it ain't easy, because they got so much stacked, including these guys. You know what? These guys are apart of the Democrat Party. They are a part of it. You might as well call them Democrats. You know, it's owned by Commicast. They're just as bad as CNN, or they're just as bad as MSNBC. And by the way, CNN and MSNBC, their ratings are down the tubes. It's great. I love it. I love it. But they think the Washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election. That's what they think. There's never been a time like this. Think of it, you have the greatest economy in the history of the world. Other countries come to see me, all of their leaders, and they say, ""Sir, "" first thing, ""Sir, congratulations on your economy. We're trying to do the same thing. Congratulations, sir."" And these guys don't like talking about it. And if they do, they say, ""Obama did it. Oh, Obama, Obama."" Remember Obama said, ""You will never be president. He will never be president?"" Then remember he said, ""I will consider it a personal front if you allow him to be president?"" And then I became president. He wasn't so happy. And in all fairness, he campaigned harder than Crooked Hillary, because he had more strength. I mean, I go to these places, Secret Service, they take me. I haven't seen a lobby in three years. It's true. I go through basements. I pass compactor plants. I know more about compactors from this job. I don't see lobbies. I say ""Fellows, you think you could ever maybe take me through a lobby?"" ""No, sir."" But I'll tell you what. I go upstairs, downstairs, all around. They're taking me up three flights, go down one. I said, ""Are we almost there?"" ""Yes, sir, another four flights."" And I say, ""You think Hillary could do this? I don't think so."" They'd bring her back home. She wants to go to sleep. And now I hear she wants to run again. Wouldn't that be great? Oh. Thank you. Thank you. Oh would we love that? You think the Democrats are screwed up? Wait until that happens. Wouldn't that be … Oh, there's my guy. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Well look, based on the FBI report, you just saw what happened with the IG, where they came out with the FBI. Based on that, you know what? I never stopped you. But now, think of what they did. Think of what they did. Think of how dishonest it all was. They shouldn't even be allowed to have an impeachment, because it was based on dishonesty. It was based on illegality. She went out, and they paid for a fake dossier. They gave money to foreigners to write a fake dossier, totally disproven, totally fake. The FBI then took that fake dossier and they used it in the FISA Court to get approval to spy on my campaign. And if we were Democrats, they would've been in jail two years ago. It's a disgrace. Think of what they did. So they use this fake dossier, and they brought it before this big deal court. It's a big deal, the FISA Court. And they said this stuff, and they lied about it, because Comey, who's another beauty … did I do a great job when I fired his ass? What a great job. Oh no, they had bad plans. No, I did a great thing. That was like throwing a rock at a hornet's nest. Did that place explode? And then we learned about Lisa Page, and her wonderful lover, Peter Strzok. I love you Lisa. I love you more than anybody in the world. I love you more than anybody in the world. It causes problems with the wife, but we won't talk about that. Those tapes didn't work well. No, how about those statements, right? And then they say, ""In all fairness,"" … I really liked the report, but how does the Inspector General say … because don't forget, he was appointed by Obama. So I'm not knocking him because he gave us a lot of nuggets, but we had a lot of those nuggets. How does the Inspector General say, ""You have these horrible … he's going to lose. Isn't he? He's going to lose, or she's going to win 100 million."" Did you see all the zeros? It was like … I'm blinking. I says, ""I think it's 100."" ""He's going to lose 100 to one. Isn't he Peter? I love you so much, Peter. I've never loved anyone like you. He's going to lose 100 million to one, Peter, right?"" ""That's right. He's going to lose 100 million to one."" But there's no bias. How about the insurance policy? To me, the greatest. Just in case she loses, we have an insurance policy! We're in the insurance policy right now folks! We've been in it for three years, that's what they meant. I mean the insurance policy is on an artificial respirator, because we're doing awfully well. And I'll tell you something, Rush Limbaugh said it. Sean Hannity said it. Laura Ingram said it. Tucker said it. Ainsley said it, but a lot of people have said it. They said, ""There's nobody in the world that could have handled that stuff that happened, and still created one of the greatest economies, and done more than any other president ever before in the first three years."" I understand that. I understand that, but it's my life, very unfair to my family. I have to say this very, very unfair to my family. What they put my family through is a disgrace. Me, it's my life. It's fine. I do. But you know what? What they put my family through is a disgrace, and they ought to be ashamed, and we should get apologies all over the place. So yesterday I sent Pelosi a letter denouncing and condemning her party's outrageous abusive power. That's what it is. They have nothing. They're the ones that should be impeached, every one of them. I mean you got this guy, Schiff. He makes up a statement, and he goes in front of Congress where he has immunity, and he makes up a statement from me that's totally fictitious, totally out of thin air. The worst statement I've ever heard. Many people saw it. I had a person two weeks ago that said, ""I didn't love the statement you made. I said, ""Really? Didn't you read the transcripts?"" I always say, ""Read the transcript. But didn't you read it"" ""No, no. I heard it on television. I watched Adam Schiff."" He made it up. I then sent him the transcript. He said, ""Oh, now I feel better. That's perfect."" I call it perfect. He called it perfect. Everyone calls it, if you read it. But here's the thing. He makes up this statement, and it finished. Didn't he have eight quid pro quos? Eight. Could you imagine, you're dealing with a country, and you say eight times that you've got to do something. The first time they say, ""Well."" The second time they say, ""That's strange."" Third time they say, ""What's wrong?"" You said eight times? Eight times. They'd have you arrested. They'd have you put into an insane asylum. But he actually said … I think he said eight, not seven, eight. And then he finished with, ""Don't call me, I'll call you."" Can you imagine? The President of the United States, ""Don't call me, I'll call you."" You know what that is? That's a mafia statement, okay? That's the head of the mafia saying, ""Don't call me."" This guy actually said that, and then he walked away and people became incensed, because they knew that wasn't the people that read the thing. Most people believed him. He's a liar! Because you know, he's a corrupt politician, 100%. No, he's a corrupt … and then I see him. By the way, you ever see this guy? He walks up to the mics. I mean, we're not … all fairness, look, I don't want to be … because with Me Too, I never even think about looks anymore, okay? I don't talk about looks of a male or a female, but in his case, let's just say … the last time I'll ever refer to this. He's not exactly the best looking guy we've ever seen. No, any mic. He walks up to the mic, and he's so just, ""This is a sad, sad day for America. Our president is an employee of Russia. I have absolute proof that the president,"" this is at the beginning, and every week they'd say, ""Where's the proof?"" ""It's coming. It's coming."" Then we get the Mueller report, nothing. And I'll tell you what, I know some of the people in this audience. If I spent not $45 million, not 18 Trump haters, I call them the angry Democrats. It was 13, then it went to 18, and then Mueller. Did Muller do a good job? Did he do a good job? No! Boo! How was his performance in front of Congress? Boo! Not the best, but think of this, $45 million they spent. And you know, I heard somebody say, ""Well, we got back some of that money."" Let me tell you, you cost this country billions, and billions, and billions of dollars in all of the things that didn't get done, in all of the embarrassment to our country. You caused billions and billions of dollars, and it was a hoax. But this guy, Schiff, ""I have absolute proof. I have this. I have that, this, that."" Anytime he sees a camera and he's stone faced, stone faced. He's a pathological liar. He gets up, and I've never seen anything like it. Even I was saying, ""I wonder what he has. What does he have?"" He says, ""I have absolute,"" I said, ""I haven't spoken to Russia in year. What the hell do I have to do with Russia?"" But this guy gets up … oh, I think we have a vote coming in. Haleigh! Wow! Thank you, Haleigh, great job. Wow. The Republican party has never been so affronted, but they've never been so united as they are right now, ever, never. And I know the senators, and they're great guys, and women too. We have some great women. We have great guys. They're great people. They love this country. They're going to do the right thing. They're going to do the right thing. So I said in my letter to Pelosi … I love that. You know, usually there's one, two. The Republicans, look, I've said it for a long time. The Democrats are lousy politicians, they really are. They've got horrible policies, open borders, crime is fine, drugs pouring through. I mean, think of what they do. Sanctuary cities, they love sanctuary cities. They're lousy politicians, but they have one thing … two things. They are vicious. They're the most vicious people. The Republicans aren't as vicious. They may learn to be vicious after going through this, though. But the other thing, the Democrats always stick together. Now think of it, three Democrats went over to our side, no Republicans. It's unheard of. And by the way, this is for a hundred years. I'm not just talking about this little point in time. The Republicans are known as, it's always harder to stick together. These people are great. We have a great Republican Party, and we have to get that change. We have to take back the house. You'll have the greatest healthcare ever if we take … and by the way, we had another victory. The individual mandate, just a little while ago, it came over the wires, it was just upheld. The individual mandate is now gone. The most unpopular part of Obamacare. It was just upheld. So I said in my letter to Pelosi, ""By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, you're violating your oath of office. You're breaking your allegiance to the Constitution. You're declaring open war on American democracy. You dare to invoke the founding fathers in pursuit of this election nullification scheme, yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America's founding, and your egregious conduct."" And listen though, it's so true, it threatens to destroy what our founders pledged, and in fact their very lives to build. ""You are the ones interfering in America's elections. You are the one subverting America's democracy. We did nothing wrong, nothing whatsoever. This was just an excuse. You are the ones that are obstructing justice. You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our republic for your own selfish, personal, political and partisan gain."" They're bringing pain. The work we could be doing on lowering drug prices, on getting rid of these horrible, horrible situations. You know in the border … the woman is okay? Is she okay? Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. I mean, some of these people are waiting here for three days, right? Thank you. They'll come back. Come back. Merry Christmas! Thank you. Merry Christmas is true. But what they've done with this perversion, it's perversion. And when you watch some of these people get up and speak today, they don't even … ""You have violated the Constitution."" ""Well, what does he done wrong?"" ""Well, we don't know that."" They don't even have any crime. This is the first impeachment where there's no crime. I say, ""Tell me what I did, please."" ""Well, we don't know. You violated the Constitution."" You had Turley, who's smart, Alan Dershowitz, these guys. All of them, they said, ""There's no crime. There's no crime,"" right? There's no crime! There's no crime! I'm the first person that ever get impeached, and there's no crime. I feel guilty. You know what they call it? Impeachment light. It's impeachment light. That's why, with Richard Nixon, I just see it as a very dark era, very dark, very … oh, you don't even like to think. I don't know about you, but I'm having a good time, it's crazy. But I also know we have a great group of people behind us in the Republican Party, we really do. Maybe I wouldn't feel the same way, but we have a great group of people behind us. We had in the House, and we have it in the Senate. They're doing a great job, so I'm not worried. I'm not worried, because it's always good when you don't do anything wrong, you get impeached. That may be a record that will last forever. But you know what they have done? They've cheapened the impeachment process. And now anybody that become … this is a sacred position. Anybody that becomes president, I mean, they could have a phone call and they get impeached. So if the Republicans … if you had a Democrat as president, we have a Republican house, they don't like the guy for whatever reason, or the woman, they impeach the person. It's cheapened it. It's exactly what our founding fathers didn't want, and they said it could happen, and it's happened. But I know one thing, Americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote Pelosi the hell out of office. But it's so disappointing. I see a woman, Carolyn Maloney. She's a long time, nothing much, believe me. She's a Congresswoman from Manhattan, the east side. I was with her. Her first race, I helped her. She was always so nice, ""Oh, thank you, thank you."" I made lots of contributions over the years. In New York, if you're not a … it's purely Democrat, especially in Manhattan. So what happens? I make lots of contributions for years, and years, and years. I go run. The first person I see, Carolyn Maloney. I raise my hand to impeach. Well, give me back the damn money that I've been paying her for so many years. Let her pay me back all the money. Let her pay me back all the money. Then you have this Dingell. Dingell, you know Dingell, from Michigan. You know Dingell? You ever hear of her, Michigan? Debbie Dingell, that's a real beauty. So she calls me up like eight months ago. Her husband was here a long time, but I didn't give him the B treatment. I didn't give him the C or the D. I could've. Nobody what is, you know? I gave the A+ treatment. ""Take down the flags."" ""While you're taking them down for ex-Congressman Dingell …"" ""Oh, okay?"" "" … do this, do that, do that, rotunda everything."" I gave him everything. That's okay. I don't want anything for it. I don't need anything for anything. She calls me up. ""It's the nicest thing that's ever happened. Thank you so much. John would be so thrilled. He's looking down. He'd be so thrilled. Thank you so much, sir."" I said, ""That's okay, don't worry about it."" Maybe he's looking up? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe, maybe. But let's assume he's looking down. But I gave him A+, not A, not B+, not B. I gave him the A+, and she called me. She said, ""Oh, no."" I won't go into the conversation, because it's not fair do that. But all I want to say is, let's put it this way, it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get on a scale of zero to 10, it was a 10. Okay, so that was what? February or something. Now they talk about this phony impeachment, and she's out there, ""Well, we have to look seriously at our president, because he may have violated the Constitution of the United States."" Boo! ""And I can't be happy with that, because I love our country. I love this, and I love that."" She loves everything. I said, ""She's a no,"" okay? No, but I look at her, and she's so sincere, and what happens? ""I vote to impeach Trump."" And you know what? I didn't say, ""Who the hell knew this was even going to come up?"" I went through the whole Muller hoax. They did this big report. I was totally exonerated. They didn't even bring it up at the impeachment, because I was totally exonerated. If they saw one little kernel, one little quarter of a sentence … look what they did with one word. Remember this, what did I do? Why did I do? It's us. But they don't say it that way. They say, ""I."" They read it totally different, schiff and his band of thieves, they read it. Now I say basically, very simple, do us a favor, our country. Do us! Do us! Not me! Our country! And then what do I say? I say, ""The United States Attorney General, Attorney General of the United States could speak to you, it would be great,"" okay? Because it's known for major corruption. In fact, the new leader of Ukraine got in on a construction … on a platform where he looks for all of the problems of dishonesty, and everything that was going on in Ukraine, right? He looked for it, that's how he got into office. He got into office that way. So we take it and they repeat it a thousand times, and they never say with the right … so I go wild, and we start. And the Republicans have got it right. Now we always correct him, but I use the word us. Us is the United States, our country. And then it actually says, I think, ""Comma, country,"" but they don't say that. They say, ""Do me a favor."" How many times have you heard it? Where they say in a speech? ""And then the president said, do me a favor."" Well, that's not what I said. I said, ""Do us a favor, our country."" And then I said, the Attorney General of the United States, I didn't say my campaign- I said the Attorney General of the United States, I didn't say my campaign manager. Okay? I said the attorney … And these people want to impeach the President of the United States for that? Oh, and then what happened? Right? Then what happened? So then, the President of Ukraine, who's a quality person, said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever. That was a killer for the Democrats, right? Then his foreign minister said the same thing. He said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever. There was no pressure. That's a killer. So now did you see what the Democrats did a couple of days ago? They tried to say that he's not a strong person, that he was weak. They used the word weak, that he was weak, and under the power of Trump, he said. Do you know how insulting that is? Anybody that becomes president of a country, and that's a big country and it's a tough country, you got to be tough. He's tough. But so what they're saying now is he was weak because the wording, it just doesn't fit. Okay? These are really dishonest people. And if the press was fair, this thing never would have happened. So the House Democrats are surrendering their majority, their dignity, their reputations. They look like a bunch of fools. And I'll tell you, we have a lot of new stars in the Republican Party, I could read off a list of 20 names. But they're giving up their honor, and they'll receive a big backlash at the box office. When you take a look, that ballot box, that ballot box on November 3rd, I think we're going to have crowds like we've never had. And I'll tell you something, it used to be, they'd always say, ""Oh, the Republicans."" You know, in 2018, I didn't run. I didn't run, right? They all said, ""Oh, we didn't."" Well actually, we picked up two seats in the Senate that these guys never talk about. We just approved 171 federal court justices, 171 federal justices, including courts of appeal, 171. We'll be up, probably by the end of the year, to 182, and for that, I thank President Obama. He gave me 142 openings. He gave me 142. I said to him, my people, I got there, because they say the most important thing you could do as a president is judges and Supreme Court. We have two great Supreme Court judges. Right? Two Justices of the Supreme court, Kavanaugh, Gorsuch. Two great men. They're great. And how about the pain that they put Justice Kavanaugh through, right? Over a phony deal, I hate to tell you. Over a phony deal. What a disgrace, what they put that man through and that family through. Just remember it come November. You got to remember, it's a long time. You know, in the life of Trump, 10 months is an eternity. It's a long time. Somebody said, ""Congratulations sir, you're going to win."" I said, ""Don't say that. Just don't talk about it. Let's always pretend you're one point down."" Like last time. Going to be close. Nope, it's going to be close. But what they put that man through was horrible, what they put his family through was horrible. And you know, those stories largely have been recanted. And frankly, the ones that didn't recant, I don't know what a Supreme Court judge does, but he should sue them. He should sue them. So we want to take back the House, we'll hold the Senate, and we'll keep the White House. You will have the greatest healthcare. You will continue with the greatest judges. You know, we have judges that are … We just had a great story in the Wall Street Journal. I have to be always very truthful, because if I'm a little bit off, they call me a liar. They'll say, ""He gets a Pinocchio,"" the stupid Washington Post, they have Pinocchio. I mean, even if you're saying things perfectly, it's a Pinocchio. There's nothing you can say where you don't get a Pinocchio. But what happens, what happens is we have Wall Street Journal the other day got the best story. They said, ""Whether you like him or not, the job he's done on judges and Supreme Court Justices, but the job he's done on judges is amazing. Say it's the most important thing. See, I don't agree. I say defense is the most, the military is the most. But once you're beyond the military, I mean to me defense is the most important. Because without good defense, maybe we don't need judges so much, right? It's like somebody said, ""Well, we violated the budget."" I said, ""Do me a favor, don't worry about the budget. If we're attacked and aren't doing very well and somebody says, ‘Well, at least we have a good budget,' that doesn't work too well."" Right? That doesn't work. So we have great military, we have great judges, we have great everything. Drug prices down. For the first time in 51 years, drug prices came down. And that was with no help from the Democrats. If they helped, because you need their votes, if they helped, I could get those drug prices down 40 and 50%. Okay? And we just approved, and we're approving very soon for the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, where he can buy, he has the right to go, we're giving him the right to go and buy from a foreign country, where the prices for the identical drug, identical drug are 50% less. He's going to do that for the people of Florida. And we're going to do that for your governors if they want to do that. We'll get that down so far. Everyone in America can see straight through the Washington Democrats' phony, dangerous charade. Schiff makes up so many things. Pelosi makes it up, and she backs him up. I saw her on a television show, and George Stephanopoulos, that's another beauty, he said, even he said, he was defending me. I couldn't believe it. He made this statement, ""But you know he lied on that. He made up this stuff."" ""No, he didn't, he didn't."" So that means Nancy Pelosi said no, the statement that he made up. But it's all going to end soon, and it's going to come out to a beautiful, great victory for the Republican Party and for this nation. Thank you very much. So that's it. We have the greatest country. We've turned around a ship. We need four more years. If we don't have it … Now, if you want to drive them crazy, we had one group in Pennsylvania, some guy started screaming, "" 16 more years."" 16. They went crazy. And you know what they don't understand? When I do get out, they're all going to go out of business. They're making more money than they've ever made. That crazy New York Times, one of the worst newspapers in the world, one of the most dishonest newspapers in the history of the world, totally phony. They came out with a story, where it was a great headline for me, and the people that read it, the super radical left, they called and complained so much that they changed the headline and took it from positive to negative on a good story. Can you believe it? No, they're among the most dishonest people. But I'll never forget, before I took that great escalator ride down with our First Lady … Our First Lady is doing a great job, great job. I said, ""First Lady, you're so lucky I took you on this journey, this wonderful, beautiful journey."" And it is. You know why it's a wonderful, beautiful journey? Because look at, what we're accomplishing is unbelievable. It's unprecedented. It is unprecedented what we're accomplishing. ""You're so lucky,"" I said it to all my people. I have great people in the back. I say, ""You folks are so lucky I took you on this. You could be home right now, relaxing."" But I'd rather be here, frankly, than any place. These rallies are great. They're inspiring. You are inspiring. And you know, it's funny, we're not even into election season. Yeah, it's a long way away. We're not even in it. And yet, I think the enthusiasm right now is greater than it was even before the 2016 election. Does that make any sense? I think a lot of it has to do with a witch hunt. A lot of it has to do with the phony, witch hunt because you're smart people. You're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. You're the elite. You do better than they do. They talk about it, don't you hate it? ""Well, the elite … "" Oh really? I went to better schools. Many of you went to better schools. We won't talk about homes, even though your homes are nicer. We won't talk about jobs. You see the jobs reports? You see what's happening? Do you see where wages are going up? You know, when I first started, when I was here, one of my first speeches, I was talking that people made more money, that was four years ago, so it was 20 years before that, so that's 24, 25 years ago. They made more money 24 years ago than they were making when I got elected president. And they worked one job versus two or three jobs. Now it's going up beautifully and we want that, the salaries. And you know, the number one group of people that are going up is the blue collar worker. It's percentage, the best. The blue collar worker. They had two and three jobs. The blue collar worker is going up the most. Anyway, so you know what else? The thing I'm happiest about, African American unemployment, the lowest in the history of our country. African American. Remember I used to say, you remember, look at, you. Are you the greatest guy? Everyone thinks, do I pay? I'm telling you, I have a group of African American guys, and gals by the way, that follow me around and they think I pay them, and I don't. I love them, they love me. They come. How many rallies have you come to? A lot. They're great people, just great. Thank you. I don't even know who the hell he is. Is that right? I don't know him, but I like him. I see him at so many rallies. I appreciate it. You and your group, they're great people. Thank you. So you're obviously doing well if you can travel around like that, right? Ah, he knows. I appreciate it, I really do. I think it's fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. But think of this, African-American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in the history of our country. Their poverty levels, they had a horrible poverty level, in the negative sense, now their poverty levels are the best they've ever been in the history of our country. Same with Hispanic Americans, the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers. And the same with Asians, the best unemployment. And women, I'm sorry, 71 years, best in 71 years. I've let the women down! But I think within another couple of months, you'll be historical. So only 71 years best. The best in 71 years. But what we're doing has been an incredible thing. It's an incredible thing. When I'm on the debate stage with one of these characters, and they try and say negative stuff, I'll just say, ""Well, here's the story. In the history of our country, this group is doing the best, and that group is doing the best, and the women are doing the best, and everybody's doing. And frankly, you know what it is? The whole country's doing the best. Okay? The whole country is doing the best."" So we have records and everything, and yet they're trying to, and they really are, I've never seen anything like it, they're accusing me, really, of doing what Joe Biden … Biden admitted what he did. How about this? They protect him. Did you see the crummy debate? Those debates are so boring. They're dying in the ratings. They're dying, they're dying. "" While it's totally unsupported!"" What's unsupported? He's on tape saying that he's holding back $1 billion from Ukraine unless you change the prosecutor. How about that question? I won't say who answered, because you know I'm not, I actually used to like the guy, he was a nice guy to me, but now I don't like him so much, but that's okay. But he goes, ""While it's totally unsubstantiated, and while we beg your mercy that we're asking you even to bring up this question, but President Trump said you refused to give $1 billion of taxpayer money to Ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your son's company."" And Sleepy Joe gives a sleepy answer, and that's the end of it. That's it. Then whenever I bring it up, do you ever notice they always use, "" While these charges are totally unsubstantiated""? He's on tape! If that were me, it's the electric chair. They would bring the electric chair back. No, the guy's on tape, and they always say it's unsubstantiated. ""It is not supported by fact,"" one of them the other day, they finally changed the word. ""It is supported by fact."" No, it's supported by tape. No, it's unbelievable. In many ways, I'd like to have him win because number one, he's going to have to eventually answer that question, and number … She said he doesn't know where he is. That's the other problem. Now, I've been doing this for a long time, and I have much bigger crowds than anybody's ever had in history. By the way, do you know what? I say it against the fake news, because you know what they're going to say. Every stadium is packed. I give my people one instruction, get the largest stadium you can get. Now, that's why I was a little surprised. But in Battle Creek, you don't have that many, right? Not too many stadiums. But I wanted to be here. You know why I wanted to be here? First of all the crowd is incredible. The crowd outside. But let me tell you. No, you know why I wanted to be here? Because we have a lot of choices, but I wanted to be here because this area supported me so overwhelmingly, and I said, ""I want to be there."" Pretty simple, pretty simple. Pretty simple. I wanted to be here for that reason, and I just want to say thank you, because I'll tell you what, you came in … I don't know, I didn't get 100%, but we got a damn good percentage, right? We got a damn good percentage. So it's really thrilling to be here. But we're joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders. Your Michigan House Speaker, Lee Chatfield. Where's Lee? Lee, come up if you want. Come on, what the hell, we have nothing else to do. Should we get him up? Yes. Come up Lee, come up Lee, get up here. Come on up, Lee. Republican Party Chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, who I spoke to. And the bottom line on the end of her story, so when I won I said, ""Who's going to head up the RNC?"" I said, ""I got to get that woman from Michigan."" Remember they were all saying, ""You can't win Michigan""? Now we're going to win it by so much, you better remember all those. Every time a car plant opens, please think about Trump. Come on up here, Lee. Michigan GOP Chairwoman, Laura Cox. Thank you. Hate to tell you, but all your congressmen, you know where they are right now. Your congressmen, all of your Congresspeople, men, wonderful people, they're at a place called Congress right now. They're doing an unbelievable job of supporting your President and supporting you. They had a choice, ""Sir, should we leave and be there?"" I said, ""Don't leave. Stay right where you are."" That's why we got that vote. That's some vote, right Lee? The Chairman of the Woman's Workers and Workers for Trump, and a proud union autoworker, Terry Bowman, who's been so terrific. Thank you, Terry. Come on up. And while Democrats are obsessed with impeachment, we're focused on jobs, jobs, jobs. This group, local leaders. And all your Washington folks, they are right where they have to be in Washington tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Great job. Thank you very much. We've eliminated more job-killing regulations than any administration in the history of our country, whether it's four years or eight years, or in one case, much more than eight years. In a period of two and a half years, we have eliminated more regulations than any other president, by far. You're saving almost $3,000 a year because of regulation cuts. Total income gains for median households will reach $10,000 a family. I'll give you a couple of quick numbers. So under President Bush, for eight years, you saved $450, meaning you took in 450 bucks. Okay, fine. Under President Obama, you took in $975. Under President Trump, including the energy savings, and the regulation savings, and the tax cut savings, it's more than $10,000 in less than three years. Pretty good, right? So for two eight-years, you had a 400, 450, and a 975. That's eight years. 450. In less than three years, you had more than $10,000. That goes right into your pockets. It's one of the reasons our economy is doing well, because, as they say, the consumer is doing better than they've ever done. And that's great, that's what we wanted. We've ended the war on American energy, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on planet earth. And these maniacs want to close it up. How about going to Texas? You know Beto? What? Remember what he said, I said, ""Oh, this guy's a loser. You know a salesman, like if you're a great salesman, you never talk that you're a great salesman. You don't walk in and say, ""Well, I'm a great salesman. I can sell … "" Any guy that does that, they're no good. It's those quiet type that get you. You know, the ones that don't talk. So Beto, when he first got in, remember this clown? He gets in, no, no, he gets in. ""I was made for this job, to run for president."" After about two weeks, they killed him. He was gone. But you remember, he was against the Bible, he was against religion, he was against guns, and he was against oil and gas. And he comes from Texas. I said, that's a platform. Think of it. He's against religion, he's against guns, and against oil and gas. Think of it. I don't like to bring it up because he's gone zone, but he comes from Texas. I said, ""Abraham Lincoln can't win in Texas with that platform."" But they are, all of them, they want to close up your energy. It's a big deal. They want to close up your steel mills. They don't want your steel mills. Look at what I've done for steel. I mean, the steel is back. We taxed all of the dump steel coming in from China and other places, and your steel mills that are doing great, they're expanding all over the country. And they were going to be out of business within two years. The way they were going, they were gone. United States Steel is spending now billions of dollars on expansions. Every major Democrat running for president has pledged to eliminate gas powered automobiles and destroy the U.S. auto industry forever. And you know why? Because they have these maniacs that say you got to go all electric. I want to have an alternative, a big alternative. You're going to always have the alternative. And a lot of people don't know of the electric can ever catch the gas, you know? And by the way, there'll be different forms of energy coming along. But they want to close them up, and we're not closing them up. We're going to have lots of alternatives so that you can have it from a pricing, you can have it for a lot of different reasons. We're even bringing back the old light bulb. You heard about that, right? The old light bulb, which is better. I say, ""Why do I always look so orange?"" You know why? Because of the new light, they're terrible. You look terrible. They cost you many, many times more, like four or five times more. And you know they're considered hazardous waste. When a light bulb is out, you've got to bring it to a dump. So let's say, over here in Battle Creek, where's your nearest dump? Okay, that's what, a couple of hundred miles away. So every time you lose … drive a couple of hundred miles, right? I said, ""How many people do that?"" Nobody. What do they do? They throw it in the garbage. But you know what it is, because it's all gas. It's much more expensive, four or five times more. And I came into office, I did a lot of this. Sinks, showers, all of this stuff, I did a lot of it. No water comes out. You have areas where there's so much water, you don't know what to do with it. You turn on the shower, you're not allowed to have any water anymore. I mean, we do a lot of it. Dishwashers, we did the dishwasher, right? You press it. Remember the dishwasher, you'd press it, boom, there'd be like an explosion, five minutes later you open it up, the steam pours out, the dishes. Now you press it 12 times, the women tell me, ""Again."" You know, they give you four drops of water, and they're in places where there's so much water, they don't know what to do with it. So we just came out with a reg on dishwashers. We're going back to the old. By the way, by the time they press it 10 times, you spend more on water, and electric. Don't forget, the whole thing is worse because you're spending all that money on electric. So we're bringing back standards that are great, and better machinery that you can have the water again, right? But with the light bulb, I said, ""What's going on with the light bulbs? A lot of people are complaining about the cost."" So I had a couple of experts come in, I said, ""Tell me, what gives a better light?"" ""Well, we liked the old light bulb better."" I said, ""I like it better."" And so what I did is you can have either one. If you want to buy the newer kind, you can. And if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind, like I do. So we're bringing back the old light bulb. So it's a much less expensive, it probably gives a better light. But whatever it is, and you'll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb. I mean, it sounds like little, but it's big stuff. Okay? It's big stuff, and we're doing it with a lot of other things, our dishwashers. And you know, I won't tell you one of the things, because every time I tell you, they do a big number on it. You know the one I'm talking about, right? Sinks, right? Showers. And what goes with a sink and a shower? 10 times, right? 10 times. Not me, of course, not me, but you, him. But I never mention that, because one time I mentioned all three, I said, ""Sinks, showers, and toilets."" The headline was, ""Trump with the toilets, toilets."" That's all they want. They don't even mention it. So I didn't mention that, okay? I go off the record. But you know what? It's terrible. You want to wash your hands, you turn on the sink, no water comes out. So you leave the water going 10 times as long, it's the same thing. You have a shower, drip. It's no good for me. For me. You know the one thing that came out really good about being in this business? They always used to say I wore a hairpiece. It's okay. I know people wear hairpieces. But they always used to say. They don't say that anymore because I have been through the worst storms. If you wear one of those suckers, you got to give it up fast because within two weeks they got you. You look handsome, don't worry about it. But in the last two decades before my election, we lost one in five auto manufacturing jobs in this country. The people are trying to impeach us for doing all of the things that they've wanted to do for so many years. And that's why it doesn't work. We look so forward to taking it on, and it is all about cleaning the swamp, draining the swamp, and we have a very, very big, bad, dangerous swamp. Okay, that's enough of that. That's enough. So among the very first acts that I did was to stop the deal that would have dealt a death blow to the U.S. auto industry. I withdrew from the horrible Trans Pacific Partnership. That would have ended your auto industry. A lot of people don't know that, but I do. Remember TPP? We were basically ceding our auto industry to these countries that were just going to rip us off. The people that made these trade deals, it's like, where do they come? Like the one in Korea, that was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, ""This will produce 250,000 new jobs."" And I said, ""Well, what happened?"" He said, ""Well, she was right."" Except it was for South Korea, not for us. No, it's true. It produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea. These deals were so bad. But now they're getting really good, and some of them are getting great, and over a period of time they are going to be phenomenal. Wait till you see the numbers that start coming out of this country over a short period of time. But we have to go through a little pain, because we have to do it, and then they all say, ""We're going to withdraw,"" and then I say, ""You can withdraw, I don't care. We're putting tariffs on your country."" Then they say, ""We'd love to make a deal, sir."" The new USMCA has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan where they belong. Since the election, we've created 41,000 brand new motor vehicle and parts jobs, manufacturing jobs. Remember the statement by President Obama? ""You'd have to wave a magic wand."" Remember the magic wand? Because manufacturing … And I said, ""You know, that sounds strange. What do you do if you don't have manufacturing? How do you make things?"" Right? Manufacturing jobs won't happen. Well, we've got 600,000 manufacturing jobs, and you're going to see a big, big increase. The truth is, we need more people. You know what? We need more people. We need more people coming into the country, and they're going to come in, and they're going to come in through merit, and they're going to love our country, and they're going to respect our country, and they're going to work. We do need more people. They're opening these massive, Foxconn in Wisconsin, they're opening these massive plants and it's hard to get people. We want people coming in, but they have to come in, only they have to come in through merit. Fiat-Chrysler recently announced a $4.5 billion investment in Michigan, including the first new auto plant in Detroit in more than a generation. And General Motors recently announced a $300 million investment at its Orion Assembly Plant right here in Michigan. Come on, General Motors, let's go. General Motors gave us a little hard time with one building. I wasn't happy about that. That was the only building I had a problem within the whole car industry, right? Right? You know the one I'm talking about. I didn't like that. Anyway, but they're spending money, you know, what can I tell you? But these companies are coming in, a lot of the foreign companies are coming because they have to. I say, ""You have to, or we're not trading with you anymore."" Because we had such big deficits with these countries. With Japan, we had a $68 billion deficit. I said, Shinzo, he's great Prime Minister of Japan. But he said, ""But nobody has ever asked us to do this."" I said, ""I'm asking you."" They are building many, many plants. They're building many plants now in the United States, the Japanese. And after years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. Is that okay? We were surrounded with globalists. You know, they think it's okay. You open a plant in some country that you never heard of, they make your product, they send it. In the meantime, they close all their factories here. We're not doing that anymore. Those are globalists. They think it's wonderful to have deficits. I don't. They think it's great. It's a great thing to have deficits. No, those are globalists. The globalists are passe.  our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you, the American people, before anybody else. We must care for our own- We must care for our own citizens first Democrat immigration policies are resulting in brutal assaults and wicked murders against innocent Americans. I don't even know what's happening. It's terrible. And we've moved out thousands and thousands of MS13 thugs out of our country. And we have agreements now with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. They didn't use to take them back. If we had a murderer, then we should get them the hell out. We don't really want them in our prisons and take care of them for 50, 60 years. We want to bring them back. They wouldn't take them. The planes used to go around and around, don't land, don't land. With us, they land. We worked out deals with every one of them. We stopped giving them all the aid. We're giving them all this money and then they said, ""We're not going to let you land. We're not going to let you take them back."" I said, ""That's okay. 500 million, we were giving them. I said, now we give them $5 we give them nothing. All of a sudden they said, ""We would love to have them back."" We would love it. It's wonderful to have them back. In June, two illegal aliens in Sandusky, Michigan were convicted of sadistically beating and stabbing a woman to death with a kitchen knife. Then, they hid her body in a water drain. A criminal alien with two previous deportations was just arrested in Michigan and convicted of brutally beating and strangling to death, a single mother of five young children. It's happening all the time. Far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities, which deliberately release dangerous, violent criminal aliens out of the jails and directly onto your streets. We had a great election in North Carolina recently, two great congressmen got elected, you don't hear about it, when they win, you don't ever hear about it, just a few months ago. Two great people and they got elected and they got elected because I went in and said, ""Talk about the fact that you have sanctuary cities"" and they had some horrible crimes happening from those sanctuary cities. Soon as I mentioned that, boom, they went up like rocket ships and they won their elections and it was great. Great thing. The sanctuary cities are a disaster and let me tell you, the people of California, they don't like sanctuary cities either. They're stuck with them because they have crazy politicians. Earlier this year, authorities in the sanctuary jurisdiction of Kent County, Michigan, anybody know Kent County? Released an illegal alien charged with assault with intent to murder after he repeatedly and viciously stabbed a man in the head with a broken bottle. They let him go to roam free in Michigan communities. If you want to end sanctuary cities in Michigan, if you want to protect your families from criminal aliens, if you want to have a safe life, frankly, it's so crazy what they're doing. You wouldn't even believe it. You have only one choice in 2020, you must vote Republican. Thank you. I'm surprised. As you know, you do have sanctuary cities in Michigan. I was almost surprised to hear it, but you have them. It's one of those progressive things? They think they're doing a wonderful favor for the world. And now we're getting these prosecutors that, you murder somebody, they give you two months, they fight that you don't even have to go to jail. What's going on is crazy. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossings are down 75% since may and we've ended catch and release. We've ended it. We could've ended it so easily. It's called the loophole. You catch him and then you release him into a country. That's what you had to do by law. And if you don't do that, they arrest the border patrol people. You believe this? The border patrol people were in more danger than the criminal aliens coming in and some of these people are not good people. These are the people because look, when you have a caravan of eight or 10,000 people, a lot of those people, do you think that Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, do you think they're sending us their finest? I don't think so. Alright. How about the lottery? That was a Schumer deal. Chuck Schumer, crying Chuck, crying Chuck Schumer. I used to be a big contributor to him, he used to kiss my ass, Chuck Schumer. He'd do anything. He would've done anything for me. Anything I asked him, get Schumer on the phone, ""You do this, you do that. You get him on the phone, that son of a bitch."" He would have done, I didn't need anything, but he would have done anything. Now it's like, ""The prisoner has not acted-"". Give me a break. Give me a break. Find out how much money did I give a raise to Chuck Schumer and Chuck, give all that money back please. Carolyn Maloney, give that money back. Every penny should come back. They act so pompous. They act so righteous. They're not righteous. They're not righteous. They're bad people. The far left Democrats have never been more extreme than they are now. Democrats are pushing a socialist takeover of healthcare that will take away your coverage and take away your doctor. 180 million people are going to lose. A lot of people here now have healthcare finally under us that's phenomenal. And that's what you want. They want to take it away, 180. They want you to go to a hospital ward someplace and sit there all night. I don't think so. Not in this group. And you know what? Some people, it's good so people, but can you imagine? They want to take away 180 million people, great, private, highly negotiated healthcare where you have your own doctor. Remember Obama? 28 times, ""You can have your doctor, you can have your plan."" Didn't work out that way, did it? I think we should impeach him for that. Let's impeach him, for that, for the IRS scandal, for the guns. Remember the guns, he was giving them to anybody that wanted them. He gave guns to the worst people in the world and then they didn't have them registered, right? Not to good. Impeach him. Why didn't the Republicans impeach him? Those were really, how about giving around $1.8 billion in cash? How about that? By the way, I ended the Iran nuclear deal. I hope you happy, much different country. But how about giving Iran $1.8 billion in cash. Many big planes going over to Iran, loaded up to the ceiling with cash. You know what $1.8 billion, you ever see like at a casino, $1 million wrapped up? It's a big pile of stuff, that's a million. Now multiply it, $1.8 billion in cash he gave. So, why is he allow to do that? Did anybody try to impeach him for that? Everybody knew it was wrong. Republicans will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions and we will protect your preexisting physicians. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth. Right? That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. And that's what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream. And that's really what it is. We're also the party of the great Abraham Lincoln. A lot of people forget that, but we have to bring it up. To protect the health and safety of our citizens, we awarded $100 million to improve water infrastructure in Flint. How badly was Flint? Who were the geniuses that did that to you? You have clean water coming into Flint. They had to pay a very tiny little fee. So instead, they go into this horrible, horrible, really polluted water and the water comes out of there. They spend hundreds of millions of dollars to save like a couple of bucks, and the water was so terrible and it hurt the people. It hurt the people. But we're getting it fixed. And I know your previous governor was a Republican, but I was not a big fan of his. I was not, but I'm not a big fan of the one that can't fix the potholes either. We're committed to ensuring America has the cleanest air in the cleanest water on planet earth, and that's what it's about. It's about clean air and it's about clean, beautiful water. And it's about keeping our industry, not closing it because of the ridiculous Paris Climate Accord. How's Paris doing? I don't think too well. How's Paris doing with the yellow vests? The yellow vests? You know why? Because they raise gasoline prices so they could send them money all over the world to countries that the people in France never heard of. It's not working out too well. We're lowering prices. We're lowering taxes. We're making it possible. I mean, look at gas prices now. Look at gas prices. I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Big deal. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized. Member, ""I would like to apologize. I would like to apologize."" Nah, we don't apologize. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Michigan. You're getting your auto industry back. At stake in our present battle is the survival of the American nation. If you want your children to grow up, a land of safety, it's really, we want a land of safety, justice. Well, I don't know. When I look at those FBI reports we got out, we got to clean up a lot. What they've done to hurt people, what they've done to hurt with Comey and these horrible people, what they've done to hurt people. I think one of the best things I did as president, a lot of people would say, ""With all what we've done for the economy and,"" but one of the best things is firing James Comey's ass out of there. Boy, those reports are kept. Did you see the other day? ""Well, ah, ah."" First time now he said, in other words, he's 50% there folks. He's hit the golden pond. Anyway, so what we're doing is, we're doing things that are going to make our victory, it's like a tree. We need that extra four years. We've done so much, even Right to Try. You know Right to Try? People were traveling, they're terminally ill, they're traveling all over the world. We have the best medical in the world, the best doctors, the best labs, best hospital. They're traveling all over the world, to try and get, because it takes years to get something approved. And I said, ""Wait a minute folks, why aren't we doing this?"" And they've been trying to do it for 49 years. They couldn't get it done. Not that easy. The drug companies didn't want the liability, the country didn't want the liability, the insurance companies didn't want the liability. I said, ""Here's what we do. We'll sign an agreement with the people where you're exculpated from all liability."" ""Huh? That's a good idea."" And it's a very strong agreement so we can't get sued. But I said, ""Listen, they were worried they're going to hurt people."" I said, ""These people are terminally ill. They're terminally ill, and so we do it now."" Nine months ago, all the legislators at the 49 years, so if somebody's sick, they don't have to go to Asia, they're have to go to Europe. Or if you're poor, you go home and you die. Now what happens? Very simple. You sign that document, they work it out. You wouldn't believe how many lives are being saved. It's incredible. It's incredible. I'm very proud of it, Right to Try. I hope you don't need it. You don't want it. You don't want it. Okay? But if you do, it's there. With your help, we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact the greatest trade deals ever made. They'll result in more products, proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine. What we're doing is unbelievable. We're so far ahead of everybody. What we've done in the last three years with the FDA and even the speed of what we're doing, it would take 12, 13, 14 years to get things approved. It's down to a much smaller number, but we're finding new cures for childhood cancer and we are ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We've started the process. Who would've thought that? In 10 years, it's a 10 year process, we will have ended the AIDS epidemic in America and it could have been been started before I came to office. It was just wasted time. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. They're incredible, and that includes ICE. You know how tough these people are? These are great patriots. They love our country. Even the sheriffs alone for, some of the people that they're dealing with. These guys walk into the golem's nest and in some cases they just swing it out. They can have it. They love it. These are great. If we didn't have them, and I told you before, they're taking out bad, bad, bad people by the thousands, especially MS13 gang members. Who's going to do that? Who's going to do that? Anybody in the front row? I don't know. What about you? You're a tough guy. You might do it. You could do it. I don't know. You might, yeah, you can. What you like? We're going to recruit you. I think you could handle yourself. Now, these are tough people, right? You got to be tough. Then they get accused, they're too tough. Oh, they're too tough. You have some of these guys. They knife people. They don't even need a gun because it's more painful. They knife the two young girls, 16 years old. Beautiful. They cut them up into pieces because it was more painful than shooting them. These are animals. And then Nancy Pelosi said, I shouldn't use the term animal. And by the way, she ought to go home and take care of her district where the homeless is all over the place and the tents and the filth and the garbage is a eroding right into the Pacific ocean and into their beaches. She ought to go and take care of her district in San. Do you see what's going on? And it rains and it's filth and it's needles and it's drugs and it's, you know what. It's everything and it goes right into those storm sewers. Storm, not sanitary, storm and it goes right out into the Pacific ocean into the beaches and we fine Los Angeles and San Francisco, but we've just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what they're doing. And Nancy Pelosi is playing games. She ought to go home and take care of the homeless and take care of the filth and everything. San Francisco was the most beautiful city. When you look at what's happened with the tents all over the place, where the police officers are getting sick just from walking the beat, they're getting sick. Diseases are coming back that this world hasn't seen for 30, 40, 50 years. It's a disgrace. She ought to get back and take care of her district instead of wasting time on this nonsense. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto and it's always going to be up there. They want to take everything down. They don't want Thomas Jefferson anymore. They don't want anything. That's a terrible thing and we fight for it, now. We fight. These words will never be taken off. I don't care where I am. If I'm up there, if I'm down here, I don't know, but we'll be fighting. We'll never take these words off, in God we trust. We stand on the shoulders of generations of Michigan Patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line. It's the place where General Motors, Chrysler and Kellogg transformed the nation. It gave us Motown, the Mustang and the might of the American Midwest. This is the American mid west. And Michigan is the state where generations of strong, tough and proud American workers made this into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And we are making it bigger, better and stronger than ever before, by far. Loyal citizens like you help build this country. And together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you. The American people, the Democrats took the people of Michigan for granted, but with us, you will never be forgotten again. The forgotten men and women of this country will never, ever be forgotten again. And I'm fighting for you. And I love doing it with everything that I have. And I will never, ever stop. And you know that. I will say I could have a much easier life. Some people say, ""Why is he doing it?"" You know why I'm doing it because we're doing the thing and look what we're doing is we're bringing back our country again. We're respected again, we're respected again. We are so respected, you don't even know how respected. I went to NATO where we were being ripped off because the other countries, you have 29 countries, and the other countries weren't paying their bills. They were delinquent in real estate. I noticed people are using that word. I've been using it for the last year. It's like a real estate trend. That's when they don't pay their rent, right? Well, they weren't paying and you have to see this chart, until I got there. They got to pay and they said, ""Well, does that mean you won't protect us?"" I said, ""You don't want the answer to that question."" Over the last, and the Secretary General Stoltenberg, over the last period of just two years, I raised, not from us, nothing from us, $130 billion, but that's nothing and over a short period of time they will be paying $530 billion more. All of those countries. My biggest fan in the world is Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO. He says, ""I never thought this could."" I'm telling you, if you look, it's like 15 years just down. President Obama would go there, make a speech, ""I'd like to thank everybody for being here. Thanks. Look, great job. Sayonara. Goodbye."" Bush, they all did. Nobody ever asked for money. We were spending for 100% of NATO. We're protecting Europe. They rip us off on trade, right? They rip us off like crazy. We lose hundreds of billions of dollars on trade. We're changing that, but it's a long time. It's been going on a long time. They don't take your product. They don't take your cars. They don't take your farm product. They don't take your medical machines. We do a big business. They sell us. We don't sell them because they put restrictions. We have better equipment than them, but they make it so that our equipment doesn't qualify. It's called artificial barriers or non-monetary barriers. It's brutal what they do. I'm telling you, they're as bad as China, just smaller. They are as bad as China, just smaller and now China's doing great. We're very happy, but we have to do something with that. We have to take care of our people. We can't be ripped off by these countries, so NATO is ripping us off militarily, but now they're starting to pay big money and that's good. We want to help them. We want to be there with them, but they have to pay. They have to pay. $530 billion and the fake news doesn't even want to talk about it. They don't want to talk about it. They talk about other things. They don't want to talk about that. When you'd get a chance though, just a couple of weeks, maybe you could say over a short period of time, NATO countries will be paying $530 billion more. More, not total. More. How's that? Good. That's not too bad. Nobody else could do that, I guarantee. I won't tell you what took place in those closed door meetings. Some of them don't like me. They like Obama. Germany likes Obama. A lot of these countries, France, they like Obama. It's embarrassing. In France, President Obama is more popular than President Trump. Well, I should be. I just taxed their wine and champagne coming into our country because they're ripping us off on the internet. Okay. If I ever become more popular, that means I'm not doing my job. You should say he's out. It's true. I could be loved in Germany. I could be loved in Germany. Oh, they'd love me. My father came from Germany, parents and I could be loved in Germany. They'd like me so much, but then I'm not doing my job for you. Have to do it. Have to do it. With your help, your devotion, your drive, we're going to keep on working. We're going to keep on fighting. We are going to keep on winning, winning, winning because we are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation, under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Michigan, the best is yet to come. Great state. Great state. You better remember all those jobs in a year from now, I tell you. I'll say, ""That state let me down."" I don't think that's going to happen. I'm hearing very good thing. You know the interesting thing, before it was like a promise. I said I'm going to bring car back. I'm going to bring this. I'm going to be pres, it was all like, it's good. You believed me, I was successful, all this, but now we've done it. We have done more than I promised, no politics. I promised, we've done more than we promised. No politician I think, has ever done that. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Michigan. Thank you."
Trump,"There's a lot of people. That's great. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That's a big group of people. This is on fast notice, too. Thank you. But I'm thrilled to be here with the beautiful, great, hardworking people of this incredible state. You're really hardworking American patriots. That's what you are, and a lot of people haven't been treated right until I came along. We've done a lot of work and a lot of good work, and you had your best year ever last year. The state had the best year you've ever had. 46 days from now, we're going to win Minnesota, and we're going to win four more years in the White House. One of the most vital issues in this election is the subject of refugees. You know it. You know it perhaps better than almost anybody. Lots of luck. You're having a good time with the refugees. That's good. We want to have Omar. He said Omar. That's a beauty. How the hell did she win the election? How did she win? It's unbelievable. Every family in Minnesota needs to know about sleepy Joe Biden's extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from Somalia, from other places all over the planet. Well, that's what's happened, and you like Omar a lot, don't you? Biden has promised a 700% increase in the manifesto with Bernie, right? A 700% increase in the importation of refugees from the most dangerous places in the world, including Yemen, Syria, and Somalia. Congratulations, Minnesota. A 700% increase. Good luck, Minnesota. Enjoy yourselves, because if I'm not here, if I don't win, I don't know where I'm going to be. But maybe I'll come over to see Mike. I'll come and see Mike. Your state will be overrun and destroyed, and Biden and the radical Left win. That's what's going to happen. I've been watching it for years. They haven't treated you right. They have not treated Minnesota right. Thank you. I'll tell you, these hangers are great. Remember this. It's a friendly protest. Please remember this is not a rally. You're not allowed to have political rallies of any kind. You're not allowed to go to church. You're not allowed to do anything. The only thing you're allowed to do is run wild through the streets, burn down storefronts, blow up stores, and kill people, because that's considered a protest, and that, they allow you to have. You don't have to wear masks at protests. So I said, ""We can't have a rally. The most we can have is ten people. But why don't we just call it a protest?"", because this is a protest. It's a protest against stupidity. Speaking about stupidity, sleepy Joe will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp. Think of it. 700% increase. So you're not happy now? Look at that guy over there. He's not too thrilled when he hears this. 700% increase is what they have in the manifesto. Now, maybe they don't honor it, but I would say they'll go substantially higher than that number. Biden will overwhelm your children's schools, overcrowd their classrooms, and inundate your hospitals. That's what'll happen. Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban to jihadist regions, jihadist regions. They've already been doing that to you, haven't they? Opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorists. My administration's keeping terrorists, extremists, and criminals the hell out of our country. We don't want them. We don't want them. We've got enough of them. We've got enough of them. Just today, we deported, as you know very well, dozens of Somali nationals charged or convicted with very grave crimes, including rape, assault, robbery, terrorism, and murder, of course. These hardened criminals are back in their country, where they do all the complaining they want, and your children are much safer as a result. Thank you, President Trump. Thank you. If it were up to Biden, and it's not. It's the people that's around him. They are seriously radical Left Democrats, and they're very dangerous. The offenders are very dangerous, and they'd be running all over your state. Only by voting for me are you going to say … But I hate to say this, and get it with your iron ore. I did it with some other things, and I'll do it for you again. I'll do it for you again. But if you vote for me, I'm the difference, and I'm the wall. You know the wall that we're building on the southern border? I'm your wall between the American Dream and chaos. Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the left wing mob. He has no clue where he is. This is not a sharp guy. Years ago, I said to a certain senator who I was very friendly with, a Democrat, ""Who's the dumbest senator? Who's the smartest senator?"" He gave me a name for the smartest. I said, ""Who's the dumbest?"" ""Oh, Joe Biden. You didn't know that?"" That was 25 years ago. That was in prime time. This is no longer prime time for sleepy Joe. They do disinformation. They make things up, and they make commercials. They make things up. I've never seen anything like it. Everything, they make up. First of all, I'm the one protecting your Social Security. They say, ""Trump"" … Remember four years ago, they used to say, ""Oh, Trump will get rid of Social"" … I have protected your Social Security. They're going to destroy your Social Security. Remember? Did you ever hear of a man, Fiorello La Guardia? Did you ever? I don't think that happened with him. New York, I don't think it happened with Rudy Giuliani, did it? What a great job Rudy did. You realize Rudy's just now really being appreciated. People forgot how good he was as a man. He was a great mayor. We polled it. I'd go down about 22 points. They want to poll everything nowadays. I don't believe in polls. They poll everything. But Ali Velshi, I don't know anything about the guy, but I know he was standing there. This is really quite a good scene. It's a friendly protest. Everyone's acting … and behind him, the entire city was burning. It's one of the great pictures of all time. The entire city was burning down. That was your city, and it's a shame it took so long, but the governor finally did it at least. If you take a look at Portland, the governor can't quite do it. She can't get there. I speak to her all the time. ""Come on, Governor. I can straighten out Portland. Give me less than an hour. Just let us have it for"" … because the state has to ask for it. They have to request. It's a shame. It's such a shame. But in your case, we went, and all of a sudden, it was really … That was going to be a bad night, too, right? Remember that, about seven o'clock? Then you see this guy walked out with about a $250,000 outfit on. That's because it had more computers and this and that. Got the tear gas deal. He's got the whole deal, pepper spray, got everything, the finest outfit you can buy. Believe me. We just paid for them, and they were very expensive. So we see one, the helmet. How about the helmet with the goggles? You can see at night. You can see at day. You can see whenever the hell you want. So there's one. I said, ""Oh, that's only one guy."" Then you see another three, then four. Then you see another ten. They were just getting out of the buses, coming from very friendly territory. He got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas, and he went down. He was down. ""My knee, my knee."" Nobody cared. These guys didn't care. They moved them aside, and they just walked right to … It was the most beautiful thing, and that would be it. But so they had four or five lines. Then they had lines of different … Everybody did the same thing. Did they ever even move one step back? I don't think so, right? It was just a slow walk right forward. Then they just started walking faster, faster, faster, put a lot of guys in jail, Tom, right? Put a lot of guys … Great Congressman, by the way. Put a lot of guys in jail. Great. Not good. Great. They put a lot of guys in jail that night, Tom, and that was the end of it. I don't think he had any problem after that. If you had any flare-ups, we'll send them in again. But that's all you do. These are Democrat-run disasters. Look at Chicago. Look at Portland. Look at you with Minneapolis. These are disasters. By the way, are they still trying to get rid of your police force in Minneapolis? That's what I heard. See, they never learn. They never learn. They don't … You've got a lot of people here. That's a lot of people. I actually like these. We have the arenas. We've always filled them up. It's been great, and the arenas are good, but usually you have to travel 45 minutes. This thing, you have a hangar. The plane becomes your backstop, right? It's like your curtain. It's a curtain. You get a free curtain. We're outside, which actually makes people happy. It even makes the people that sometimes not everybody here likes happy, because outside is better. It's better, and we're rounding the turn on COVID, by the way. Our vaccines are coming. A lot of things are happening. We're rounding the turn. We've done a great job. We've done a phenomenal job. We don't get credit for that, but we'll discuss that in a minute. But when you look at it, when you look at it, our country is amazing. It's an amazing country. We love this country, and we're not going to let radical Left socialist/communists take over our country. Okay? They use the word socialist, and socialists aren't great. But communists are a hell of a lot worse, and that's where we'd be headed. We're standing in the way of them, this group of people. But you have a lot of groups of people just like this, every place we go. Last night, you know where we were. You saw that it was all over the place, right? That's a big state. That's a great state. Then I see the fake polls. I just saw a poll here, Minnesota. I'm down nine. I don't think so. I mean, I just don't think so. I don't think so, right? I don't think so. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. This is the craziest thing I've seen. President Trump is down nine in Minnesota. Now I just saw another plane. See the plane? The good thing about these beautiful Air Force Ones, right? That's the smaller version of Air Force One. I think you had a little bit short runway. So they take the smaller to save about $12. No, they took the smaller one. But the great thing about those beautiful planes, they have more televisions than any plane in history. We have televisions in the closet, on the ceilings, on the floors. I've never seen them on the … We have them all over the place, and I'm just coming out. They said, ""There he is."" They said, ""It's a smattering of people."" They called it a smattering. They always do that. Yet Biden with the circles, right? The little circles. He's got like four people in a circle. You know why he does the circles? Because he can't draw a crowd. So they put a circle, like he's supposed to … He's trying to be legitimate. He's going to go by the science. He always says science. He doesn't know what the word science is. So to have these four or five circles, they put people, that way he doesn't have to be embarrassed when he goes to a high school gymnasium and he has 40, 50 people. They had one not so long ago, and you saw this. He couldn't draw a crowd. It was a big thing. It was his opening or something. Couldn't draw a crowd. So they made it a round table. So he went in. They only had like 32 people. They said, ""This is very embarrassing,"" one of his people, and that's what they do. They're good. Some of the people surrounding him, they'll say anything and do anything. They said, ""Let's not make it a speech. There's nobody here. Let's make it a round table."" So these people are sitting at a table. They had no idea, and most of them didn't know anything about politics. They didn't even know why they were there. Now they're sitting on a round table, and they're on television. But that's what it is. But they say we had a smattering of people. Yes, smattering of about what? 15,000 people in about two days' notice. This doesn't include the 10,000 people, Mike, that they turned away. I hate that they turned them away. You'd think with an airport, you wouldn't have to turn anybody away, but they have a certain amount. Then sometimes you have Democrats running an airport, and they don't like all these people here. That's true. They don't like it. But if we're up to Biden, your state would be in ruins. Just take a look at what they've done, and I'm going to hit it hard. They make phony commercials about me, and it gives me the right. How about the worst one of all, the worst I've ever seen? Standing on a grave of a fallen soldier, and then they had some guy, a source said … There's no source. The source doesn't exist. They make it up, and then they take it. It's called disinformation. You're not supposed to do that. I'm not even sure if he knows. He's too weak to understand, and he's still weak to control his people. But it allows me to say whatever I want about this guy. The truth is, he's not fit to be your President. He's not mentally fit. If Biden's elected, extremists, like representative Ilhan Omar … Whatever happened to her? You had a great writer who has just made a living off writing about her. She's done so many criminal acts. Isn't it damn disgraceful that she gets away with it? I have to say to myself, I say, ""How the hell did she get away with that? If we do one"" … Look at General Flynn. He didn't even lie. They said he didn't lie, right? He's gone through hell. He's gone through hell. This guy wrote page after page of criminal acts. Well, let's see what happens. Who the hell knows? But between her and how about AOC? AOC- AOC is running a campaign against the guy that was supposed to be speaker of the house. Right? Joe Crowley. I knew him a little bit. I asked him once I said, ""Are you campaigning against this maniac?"" He said, ""No, she's just a young girl. No problem."" I called him on election night. Nah, I was going to, I was going to say, ""How did that work out, Joe? That didn't work."" He was going to be Speaker Of The House. He's got a certain talent. But you know she had no money, nothing. And all of a sudden she had $2,000,000 and she spent the $2,000,000 all over the place. Her and her boyfriend. Whatever happened to her? Can you imagine if I'd do that? You have to look at that. She spent the $2,000,000 and big story. But that was it. That's one quick story. Oh man. Probably the guy who wrote the story, lost his job at the New York Times. Right? He's now unemployed, but there's a big story. She spent $2,000,000 on bullshit. If a Republican did that they'd be in jail. You know that. It's a different standard and it's a disgrace. And our guys better get on the ball. Look, let me tell you how about yesterday. They were talking about Russia, Russia, Russia. Again, here we go with the Russia. There's never been anybody so tough on Russia with the sanctions. Remember Obama would send pillows. I sent tank busters right to Ukraine. I'm the one that exposed the pipeline with Germany. Germany pays them billions and billions of dollars. And then we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia. I said, ""How does that work? How does that work? You're spending billions of dollars for energy to Russia."" It's all okay. I'm the one that exposed it. What I've done … Hey, they don't want me to go. But if you look, they don't want me to win. Russia doesn't want … Maybe North Korea does because I actually have a very good relationship with him. And speaking of North Korea and you know, it's okay to have really. You don't have to go to wars. We don't have to lose our great soldiers. It's good. If I got along with Putin. Somebody said ""He gets along well with Putin."" I'm saying to myself, ""But isn't that sort of a good thing? Is that bad."" ""He gets along with Putin. That's a bad thing."" But you saw the head of the FBI yesterday started going Russia. Russia is looking at our election. Russia. Here we go again. Russia, Russia, Russia. I said, ""What about China? What about North Korea? What about Iran? What about … "" They don't mention anybody else. The narrative seems to be Russia. Millions of phone calls made not one to Russia. Millions of phone calls received not one to Russia. Then he goes, ""Russia, Russia."" Then they asked him about Antifa. What do you think about Antifa? ""Well, it's an ideology."" I said, ""No, it's not. It's a bunch of thugs and anarchists that are being funded by somebody and find out who the somebody is."" It's unbelievable. Unbelievable when you look at this stuff. But seriously, take a look at the AOC. I call it AOC plus three. Her three people that she tells what to do. And $2,000,000. Dresses, rent, other things. You're not supposed to do that. Mr. Congressman, are you allowed to do that Sir? You don't do that. You don't buy dresses do you? If he does that's the end of his career right? No. But it's terrible. Right John? It's terrible. Will prosecute him. I mean, why not? I don't understand it. I'll tell you what. One friend of mine, very sophisticated guy, very successful guy called me up. He says, ""You know. From the day you came down the escalator with our great First Lady, our future First Lady."" He said ""From that day the people love her. She gave a great speech at the Republican National Convention at The White House. She gave a great speech."" But said ""From the day you came down the escalator with our First Lady. From the single day you've been under investigation. You've been under investigation by sleazebags. People that now we caught, cleaned up their phones."" You're not allowed to do that. Right Mr.. Congressman? My great hockey player. You're the greatest. Right? But you're not allowed to do that. You know? We want their phones. ""Oh, here they are. Oh, by the way, they happen to be totally deleted."" Like Hillary with the 33,000 emails she deleted. If she is, she's not getting her money worth. Her yoga lessons and her daughter's wedding. Right? So it was about the wedding and the yoga lessons. So I said, ""Okay, let's give her five or six each."" What do you think, Mike? Five or six each. Five for the wedding. Make it 30. Make it a hundred. Make it a thousand. A thousand for the wedding. And for the yoga, let's give her 200. Okay. What about all those thousands and thousands of emails. Probably classified. So Congress … So forget about it. Let's assume they're gone because she deleted them and then she acid washed them. And then she hit her phones with a hammer. I get rid of phones. I've never hit him with a hammer. Not even as President. I say, ""Yeah. Throw the phone away."" No, no. I've never hit a phone. Has anybody ever gotten rid of your phone and taken a hammer and wiped the hell out of it? I don't think so. So she gets a subpoena from the U S Congress. Not in a lawsuit against some guy that hates you and you're fighting and you're fighting or something. By the way you do that, you've got problems in court, big problems. But she gets a subpoena from Congress. U.S. subpoena, the most important subpoena you can get. They get the subpoena. And after she gets the subpoena, by a few days everything is deleted. Her phones are busted up and cleaned and wiped. And everything's gone. And nothing happens to her. Forget about what was on. Now think of how angry it makes me when I see it. Now how angry? Could you imagine if I'd do that it's a whole different ball game. Know how angry it makes me when I see it. And we had an attorney general that didn't have a clue. That was my fault. I was loyal to somebody. Endorsed me early. You know whey he endorsed me? Because I went to Mobile, Alabama. We had 55,000 people show up at a stadium. He said, ""I'd like to endorse you."" Then after we won, he said, ""I'd love to be attorney general."" And I said, ""No, I don't think so."" But after four or five times asking, I'm a loyal person and I did it. The mistakes sometimes you make is because of loyalty, but that's okay. But allowed her to get away with that is a disgrace. Maybe there's something they can do. So forget about looking for the emails. And they are available. And I guarantee they're in the State Department. I guarantee you they're in the state department that ought to damn well find them. They're being protected in the State Department. But forget about that. Almost as good is the fact that you're not allowed to do what she did and her lawyers should pay, Kendall should pay, equal consequence. Equal consequence. Equal. But that's the way it is. But we are making a lot of progress if you see what's going on. I said to myself, ""I'm going to stay uninvolved. I don't have to. Chief Law Enforcement Officer, can you believe it? But I think it's better if I stay uninvolved."" And I have stayed uninvolved and we do have an excellent Attorney General. Bill Barr. And I'll be honest, he's a smart guy. I think he's getting tougher and tougher and tougher every day. I think he's not going to put up with this stuff. I don't think. And you know he's got a lot of people that are deep staters, whatever you want to call them. They fight him at every turn. They fight him, fight him, fight him. But he's getting tougher and tougher. I watched over the last three days, I'm saying, ""Wow, that's sort of what we're all waiting for. Right?"" But she deletes her emails. AOC gets rid of $2,000, 000. Gets rid of it. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. And then she goes around and calls us all like what the hell are we? And she controls Nancy Pelosi. Actually Nancy Pelosi would love to get rid of her I think. How about Pelosi? Pelosi goes out and says, ""You know. I think I have my hair done."" So she goes out and she goes into this beauty parlor. I told the story in Wisconsin last night. By the way, we had that great crowd in Wisconsin. You have a feeling about places. You know the problem with Minnesota is that I think since 1972, this hasn't been won by a Republican. So, you're a little behind the eight ball when you hear that. Right? I mean, I can understand. And Wisconsin rarely. But I won Wisconsin. Unlike Minnesota thank you very much. Thank you very much, Tom. Thank you. Unlike Minnesota. But it's my fault. So I had one speech left. It started at one in the morning. I went to Michigan, we won Michigan. That was another one. Great state. We brought back so many auto companies into Michigan. We brought them back. But I had one. It was already voting day. It was election day. Because by the time I got there it was just scheduled. Had I made that one damn stop to your state we would have won Minnesota. I lost by what? A half a point. Half a point. But I get off the plane and they said, ""He's in Minnesota. He's down nine."" The recent poll. Down nine. I believe it's a suppression poll. And you know, I have an instinct about things pretty much. Somebody said ""Trump has the greatest political instincts of the last 100 years."" One of my enemies said that. And I said, ""No, I don't."" I don't believe I do. I think I have lousy political instincts."" But what am I going to tell you? Let me just say they said that. And I was very impressed by the statement. In fact, I went to my wife I said, ""You know, they say I have the greatest political instincts in over a hundred years."" And I said, ""But I don't believe it. I don't."" I don't want to be Beto. Remember Beto? ""I was born to run for president."" That was the end of his career. Beto O'Rourke who's in charge of guns. By the way, he's going to take your guns away. You know that, right? Biden. Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe is going to take your guns away. Remember Beto on the cover of a really crummy magazine. I won't mention the name. They've got a lot of bad magazines out there. The good news is most of them are dying. If not all of them. But Beto O'Rourke, he did the story and he was going to defeat Ted Cruz. He was going to do all these things. Ted beat him. And I helped a lot too. I was with Ted all the way. And I think Ted's appreciated it. But I even said, ""I'm putting Ted Cruz as one of the people for the Supreme Court."" Right? And you know why I did it? You know why I did it? Because I wanted to make sure that I had somebody on a list we had about 45 unbelievable people, unbelievable. The smartest, the best. The absolute creme de la creme, right? The best minds in the country. Conservative. They believe in the constitution. Little things like that. But I said, ""You know. I have to have somebody that we're going to make sure we get approved."" And the only one I could think of is Ted, because he's going to get 50 Republican votes and he's going to get 50 Democrat votes. They'll do anything to get them out of the Senate. Right? So anyway, but just to finish, there's no way that I'm nine points down. I look at a crowd. So they say instinct, right? So I look at a crowd and whether I have good instinct or not, this is not the crowd of somebody that's going to finish second in the state to a Sleepy Joe. Finish second to a guy that cannot put two sentences together. Now it is an ideology. It doesn't matter. I could put that broken piece of wood right there. I could put that out. And it's the same thing as Joe. It's just an ideology. It's just an idea. Now, historically, we have the biggest gap in enthusiasm of any campaign that they've ever opposed. You heard that. Like 36 points. In other words, they've got no enthusiasm for him. I have tremendous enthusiasm as we can tell. But he does have enthusiasm to beat Trump. His only enthusiasm is put anybody in there. Right? Put anybody in there. He does have enthusiasm to beat Trump. Nothing for him, but to beat Trump. Okay. But historically that never wins. When somebody has to rely on winning because of somebody as opposed to winning because people love you, people respect you … And Sean Hannity did something the other night. He said to this man, ""If you owned a McDonald's hamburger stand in a reasonably busy area, would you have Joe Biden running that stand?"" The answer is no. He doesn't have the energy. He doesn't. So he can't run the country. No, seriously. I thought it was good. I never thought of it. You wouldn't have him running your business. You wouldn't have him running a McDonald's. I have to say or a Wendy's. I have a friend he owns Wendy's. He always gets up. Ken, you haven't mentioned Wendy's? Okay. But you know you wouldn't do it because he couldn't do it. And yet he's running for the presidency. He's got no energy. I made a comment that somebody had low energy. That was the end of his political career. But Joe's energy is far lower. It's far lower. No, it's far lower than Jeb. Jeb was on the low side. But Joe, he's off the scale. Right? Joe's got nothing going. Today Biden delivered remarks, barely, to a union after spending 47 years giving their jobs to China and foreign countries in exchange for campaign cash. How about his statement? Hey, we talk about AOC being crooked. She's a hundred percent crooked. Okay. But were talking about that. Look at Omar. She came in here. Did she marry her brother? Where's that writer? That writer should be given the Pulitzer prize. He never will be. He should be though. You know the amazing thing, all of these writers, New York Times, Washington Post, right? Russia, Russia, Russia. Trump. Russia, Russia, Russia. I had 19 people. All brilliant. All radical left. All Hillary people. Actually not even a never Trumper from Bush. Okay. All Hillary Clinton people mostly, almost everyone. They were all Democrats. How about this? You're being investigated by 19 Democrats that are smart people. Okay? Smart people. So my friend says, ""You know, you are the most honest person in the world. And you've taken three years of total investigation."" You don't think they've gone over my taxes. They went over at the biggest tax firm in the country. The most prestigious. They went over everything. They spend 48 million as it comes out now. It's about $48,000,000 investigating me before I won and after I won. And we caught them spying on my campaign. That's what they were really doing. And now with the phones, I think there's like 22 or 24 people. You heard this one? They said, ""No, no, no. We made a mistake when we deleted our phone."" You know what they had to do to make that mistake? Like 19 different formulas. Right? I don't even know how you delete a phone. I didn't know you could do it. But they all made the exact same mistake. That's not good. That's not good. So let's see what happens to them. It's a criminal act you know that, right? It's a criminal act. It's criminal. Weissman's a bad guy. Put a lot of people in jail that shouldn't be in jail, Weissman. He's a bad guy. He's on CNN all the time or MSNBC which I call it MSDNC. Because it's the same thing. Owned by a company called Concast. Did anyone ever hear … With an N, not an M. Con like a con job. Concast. They a fortune on public relations. Comcast has delivered you the news, all the news. And they spend a fortune. And then I go up and make one speech and I call them Concast And that's the end of the PR for the year. They are a bad group of people. They're sick. I mean, they're sick people. They're sick and evil people and they want bad things for our country and they don't report the news. You know, in the old days, when you used public airways free, you had to get a license. I keep saying, ""If they're reporting fake news, how come they can keep getting a license?"" Whether it's ABC, whether it's NBC, CBS, or of course, CNN. Which is I mean one of the great jokes of all time, CNN. Or MSDNC. But they're cable so I guess there's a different standard. But when you're using the public airwaves free. Okay? Free. Aren't you supposed to get licensed? So I asked my people that. I ask a couple of guys and I never really get an answer. I just want to know a simple question. Do you have to report the truth when you using free airwaves and making a fortune with commercials and everything else. And I never get the right answer because there are people down deep. It's crazy. But we're getting down to all of it. A lot of progress has been made. I think you're starting to see it. We're trying to beat a terrible group of deep state people. You know I came to Washington … Think of it, think of it. I came to Washington and I had 24 years of putting people in office. And then you can probably add another four to that. And another four to that. I had many, many years, decades of people putting … So I came. Been to Washington I guess 17 times I never stayed over. Right? Never slept over. I was there 17 times. But we're riding down the beautiful Pennsylvania Avenue. And I look outside at those police. I love our police. We've got to treat our police better. I had everything. I had police. I had military. I had soldiers. I had everything you could possibly have. You never saw so much how power and strength and beauty. The beauty. And they were so proud. They're all saluting, they're so proud. They're happy to have gotten rid of that crowd that was there before us. They're proud. They're great. The police. You know, every single police force I think endorsed me. I got the one yesterday from Chicago. That's not easy. Chicago endorsed me. New York's finest endorsed me. Florida. Ohio. I mean, everybody. I don't know that he's gotten one vote. Then he says he can't mention the words law and order. Can you believe it? And then I get to the most beautiful house in the world. I can have Mar-a-Largo and all of them. But I'll tell you The White House is still The White House, no matter how you do it. And I get to this gorgeous, beautiful place. And I'm up at the incredible suite level and there's Abraham Lincoln's suite. It's called the Lincoln bedroom. Remember Clinton used to lease it out to people for money. They never change do they. Remember when Barbara Streisand, she's another beauty, by the way. But remember Barbara Streisand used to stay in that suite? Which was the only problem I had with it. But tell me … No, but I do like her voice. I do. I really do. Some of them I don't like even their voices. But she used to stay there. And I'm standing in the Lincoln bedroom. The history of the whole thing. The bed, the desk, the Gettysburg address, the beautiful four score and seven years ago. This beautiful Gettysburg address. He wrote it there. And also on his carriage ride up to Gettysburg. He delivered the Gettysburg address and they say the only one that got worse press than I did was Abraham Lincoln. Did anyone ever hear that? And I said, ""No way they got worse. Maybe he got bad. But no way he gets worse."" Now people are starting to say, ""It's probably true. I think you've got the worst."" Now they used to say, ""No, no."" Newt Gingrich, great guy. He said, ""Nope, Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. They were worse to him than anybody. He was a very depressed person. His wife was very depressed."" It was a depressed kind of a thing. He's in a war, he's in a revolution. And he was getting beaten a lot by Robert E. Lee. They want to rip his statue down all over the place. But Robert E. Lee whether you like statues or not, they don't rip statues down anymore. I signed a law. 10 years in jail if they rip them down. But Robert E. Lee won many, many battles in a row and it was supposed to be over in one day. It was supposed to end immediately because the North was too powerful for the South. But it just shows when you have leaders, when you have a great general. And Robert E. Lee, he would have won except for Gettysburg. And that was because his general was killed who's going to lead Gettysburg. Never fight uphill, me boys. Never fight uphill. He heard they were going up hill. Stop them, stop them. But we had no cell phones in that day, right? Congressmen? No cell phones. So they sent the horses to stop him. Stop him. But it was too late. They fought uphill and they got slaughtered. That's what happened. But Robert E. Lee these were incredible things. But I hope you appreciate that we had a period of time when they were ripping down all of the statues and monuments. And I said to my people four months ago, I said, ""This is crazy. These people."" And they don't even know. They started ripping down Abraham Lincoln. When they hit Lincoln I said, ""Wait a minute. This is the man. And you can't do …"" Then they hit George Washington, Thomas Jefferson. They hit everybody. They even had Gandhi. All Gandhi wanted was one thing. Peace. May we have peace. Rip down the statue we don't like it. I don't think they have any idea what they're doing. I think they're just a bunch of thugs. Okay? You want to know that? I think they are a bunch of thugs. They were going to March on Washington and they were going to rip down a statue of Abraham Lincoln. You know the exact statute. Its up very nicely. Up now. And by the way, they can take them down legally. They go through Congress as a way of doing it. But they didn't want to do it that way. And they were marching on Washington. And I said, ""Do we have any laws about this?"" They said, ""No, sir."" Now in Congress, the way it is now, the most you get is about a $10 fine. You rip down a $5 million statue and you got a $10 fine. Right? It's different world. That's when it was strong and they had laws. But we told and found this old act. And the old act said, if you rip down a monument or a statue, you get 10 years in prison. They call it prison, not jail, which sounds even worse. I said, ""Bring that sucker up immediately to the Oval Office because there are a lot of people coming to Washington."" They were going to March on the Jefferson Memorial. Do you believe that? The Jefferson Memorial. We grow up … The Jefferson Memorial. They were going to March on the Jefferson Memorial. They were going to do damage to our beautiful Jefferson Memorial after Thomas Jefferson. And I did predict that. A friend of mine said, ""You know, two years ago you said, next will be Robert E. Lee and then comes Washington. And Jefferson and Lincoln. They'd never stop. The only thing they understand is strength. Remember that."" They don't understand weakness. There's nothing you can do. These really stupid heads of these corporations that give hundreds of millions of dollars. It's like blackmail money, right? But these stupid people that run, they get $40,000,000 a year and they're weak. Okay, they're weak. But these people, they're anarchists and the only thing they understand is strength. So I said, ""Let me see this document."" I said, ""Wow, this is a very strong document."" And Derek is here. One of my attorneys, he did a great job. I don't know where the hell Derek is. He's around here. Actually he's heard this before though. Not quite. You're getting a very unique speech tonight. You know? I mean unlike Joe, I haven't even looked at the teleprompter. This guy will ""Move it up. Move it up. I can't see. Move it up."" I haven't looked at it. The poor teleprompter guy he's sitting there ""What do we do? We're on line two of the teleprompter."" He said, ""What do we do?"" No, unlike Joe, I have not looked at the teleprompter. Oh, that poor Joe. You know what's the worst part about him looking at the teleprompter? The worst part is that means that the fake news media is giving him the questions. Right? Like Donna Brazil, who was brilliantly hired by Fox. Fox has changed a little bit. Ladies and gentlemen, Donna Brazil, who was fired by CNN because she cheated and she gave crooked Hillary the questions to the debate. How would you like to be me? They give her questions to the debate. And I still won the debate and she had all the questions. Think of it. How do you do that? Donna Brazil is, ladies and gentlemen, she's going to work for Fox. Oh, that's great. That's big difference. Big difference between four years ago and now. A lot of things have changed. But I'll tell you what's changed is the fact that we have more enthusiasm now than we did four years ago. It's amazing right? But just to get back to the others. So I signed that wonderful executive order instituting this really tough law. And it says 10 years. It doesn't say, you get 10 years, but you can take it down to three weeks. It says 10 years. So these guys had just gotten there. I had a news conference because I had to let them know about it. Right? We've got many people in jail right now from before nobody even talked about taking statues down. No, but I looked at the Andrew Jackson right? With the ropes. And I'll tell you, the police did a great job. And Mark Meadows did a great job. He said, ""Charge."" They charged. And they took these guys out and they were fairly tough. But the police were much tougher. DC police. They did a great job. They were watching and they weren't able to do anything. Mark Meadows said ""Charge."" It was like from 200 years ago it was crazy. They charged and they'd beat the hell out of these guys. Or you wouldn't have that great statue on the horse of a great general. He was a great general. And he was a very good president. At least a good president. But he was a great general. The battle of New Orleans. Right? He went to jail too. We had all the evidence we needed. Thank you for that. I want to thank you fake news. We called the fake news. We said ""Can we just have that please?"" When they said, no, we just said, ""We'll take it off TiVo. That's okay. Don't worry about it."" One of the greatest inventions in history. Tivo better than television because television is useless without it. So, we signed it. And all of a sudden these same guys who were watching it, they left. Nobody showed up the next day. They're going to have 25,000 people. They had 24 people, 5 of them were brought to prison. Okay. And the next day they said, ""Well, we were going to save it for Saturday night."" And Saturday night nobody showed up. And nobody has showed up in four months to take down a statue. It's true. Because you know why? They look and they say, ""I want to take down that statue. I'm going to take down that statue. That statue's coming down."" And then somebody says, ""You know it's 10 years in jail."" They go, ""That's too much. I'm getting out of here."" It's true. Ten years is not acceptable, Mike. Right? Ten years is a lot to rip down a statue, have a little fun, especially when they have no idea what they're ripping down. But we have an idea what they're ripping down. They're ripping down in many cases, greatness. They're ripping down our past. They're ripping down our history. And that's where these guys begin. They take away your history. You look at the Middle East, you look all over. Look what ISIS did. Look what all of them do. They go down and they rip. They go into museums and they break everything and they rip everything. They want to take away your past. They're not taking away the past of the United States of America. Not as long as I'm here. What do you want? Do you want me to go back on teleprompter anybody? Okay. Here's the question. My poor guy must be having a fit. He's over there. He's so good at this stuff. He's on line three. … Good at this stuff. He's on line three. He said, ""Sir, should I use turn the sucker off? Would you rather go teleprompter or freelance?"" Isn't it nice when you have the option because you have this and you have the option to go either? See, Joe doesn't have the option. He doesn't have the option. But if Biden wins, China wins, and it's very simple. It's very simple. By contrast, I rescued the Minnesota Iron Range, I did that. Just so you know, O-Biden. I call him O-Biden, it's too long to say Obama and Biden, so I just go, O-Biden, because I don't care about… Everyone said, ""Oh no, he's in trouble. Obama's now campaigning."" Hey, he campaigned last time harder than Hillary. I said, ""No, I want him to campaign because he brings out the base."" He brings out our base. And I'm only here because of him and Joe. I'm only here because of him. I could right now be having a very beautiful life of luxury, and here I am at the hangar in Minnesota with 15 or 20 or 25,000 people. And thousands of people that couldn't get in, and I'm working my ass off. I could be at home having a good time, wonderful time. But the one thing I said is- We want trump. We want Trump. We want Trump. But I say this. I say this look, I could be home. So home was New York. I had to bail out because it was too crazy, everything has fallen apart. But home, it's so sad what the democrats have done to our great New York. Between a governor and a mayor, the crime is through the roof, the corruption is incredible, it's a sad thing that's happened to New York. Hopefully it'll come back by somebody. Somebody will go in there and do like a Rudy. You know when Rudy took over, it was so bad and they were looking for somebody and they thought he was the guy because he was a tough guy. But somebody has to go in and clean it up. This mayor, he let go of a billion dollars worth of police. He actually believed the nonsense about defunding the police. And they're all going to do it. They're all going to do it. And New York people are going to do it. I'm being totally serious now. You've got to go out and you've got to vote for Trump. You got to break this spell from 1972. You saw Kenosha. What we did for other places, you saw the Kenosha, and that was gone. That was all gone. That place was gone. We sent in the troops, it was incredible what we did, and they did it on day three. Day three is better than two weeks later, like in Minneapolis. But they did it, and we've done a great job and the people of that great state, they understand it, and I just hope the people of your state of Minnesota understand it because we don't have too many more chances with this stuff. We really don't. We don't have the luxury of sitting back and saying, ""Let's have four years of this maniac, vice president that he picked who treated him worse than any other person. That's why I say the one person that he won't pick… My great instincts, right? The one person he won't pick is Kamala because she called him a racist, she tried to me-too him. He was me-too'd. ""I've just been me-too'd Darling, what does that mean?"" But they tried to me-too him. And she was the one that brought it up. Remember Tara? She was the one that brought it up, and then he goes, ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to pick… Wait a minute, let me get her name here. How do you pronounce it? It's with a comma, like a comma, right? Like a comma."" Remember he couldn't pronounce her name? He was saying her name wrong, and she had to interrupt him. No, my name is Kamala. Like comma. I remember that. Like a comma. H1N1, that's right, Joe. Remember that Joe, H1N1. And how bad did he do in that though? How about that? How bad did he do? So come to think of it, he's out there now today. It was pathetic. By the way, did you see the Anderson Cooper thing last night? You have to watch. I don't want to watch, but I have an obligation. I'm competing against somebody. You don't want to compete and say, ""I'm not going to watch my competition, who wouldn't?"" It's boring, but I got to watch. And he got through it. He met a couple of really… The chicken thing was bad. He said chicken many, many times, and it was a little strange that I thought it was over and he pulled it back. He was able to pull it back. But Anderson is a… And he interviewed me, he's tough. You know, he can be tough, nothing against him. He could be very tough, but last night he was in rare form. He was, ""Thank you very much for being here, Mr. Vice President, are you enjoying the run?"" And compare that with my shot, where they asked me about doing ABC with George Stephanopoulos. I think it was great. I think it worked out great. You know what I call it? Debate prep. I call that free debate prep. But you know it's nasty, it's a little nasty that people… and I didn't say, ""No, you got to change the rules. No, give me the questions. I want to use a teleprompter to answer."" How about that though? Mr. Vice President, I'd like to know your feeling on nuclear warfare and how does that relate to China and Russia and where are they in the race? Well, you can't have this as your president. I don't care. Forget about me. You can't do this. The importance and the power of this position are too great. You can't do it. I've learned a lot as president. But one thing I learned is that President Xi of China is sharp. You ever see him standing with the two million men walking in front, everybody's the same height, they're wearing hats, everyone's like a pool table, right? And he's standing there by himself, and he's looking like he's not playing games. There's no games, he's sharp as you can be. And I had a great relationship, but now I feel differently. We made a great trade deal, and now I feel differently. But he's a sharp as you can be. Putin as sharp as you can be. Kim Jong Un, we would have been in a war with North Korea 100%. I asked Obama, ""Did you ever call him?"" He said that was the toughest problem we had. And we get along. Remember about a month ago, two months ago, they broke into the demilitarized zone and they said, ""Oh, he's going to attack."" I said, ""No, he's not. Don't worry about it."" I got to know him very well. We have a good relationship. People said, ""He has a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, that's terrible."" I said, ""No, that's good."" But you remember it was going to be a nuclear war, and I got along with him. Then they said, ""Trump made a terrible deal. He's given so much to North Korea."" What did I give? I was at like a semi debate with his idiot, a reporter. ""He's given a lot to North Korea."" ""What did I give?"" ""I don't know."" Sanctions, sanctions. You took away. No, I didn't. Actually, I increased the sanctions very substantially. What did you give? What did I give? Tell me. So after about four days they couldn't ask because I gave nothing except I gave heart because I don't want to see people killed on their side either. I don't want to see people killed. We'd win that. We'd win them all. We have the greatest weapons right now ever conceived by man. We've rebuilt our military to a level that nobody ever thought possible. And then the fake news. And I said that a couple of weeks ago, remember I said, ""We have created the most powerful weapons known to man."" It's true. We have weapons that are so advanced that President Xi, Putin, everybody, we're the envy of the world. But they don't know quite what we have, but they know we have stuff that they never even heard of before. And some schmuck back there said, ""I think he's given away classified information."" Now, all I'm doing is telling the world, we have the most powerful weapons in the world. I'm not even saying what kind. You don't even want to know about it. And God help us if we ever have to use them. But we have the most powerful weapons ever conceived by man. They have the missile, the super-duper, hydro sonic, I call it the super-duper, it goes five times faster than a normal missile, right? We have one goes much faster than that. But Russia got that information from the Obama administration. Russia stole that information. You knew that. Russia got the information and they built it. But we have now one that's much faster than that. That's like a slow missile. That's like considered a slow missile. But I said it was incredible. Two weeks ago I said, ""We have the finest, the best, the most incredible, sadly, the most deadly, and we never want to use it, but we have the greatest weapons ever in history by a factor of 10, by a factor of 10."" And they went crazy. ""He's given away classified."" These people are sick. All I'm doing is saying that we rebuilt our military $2.5 trillion all built in the USA, every single ounce of it. We have fighter jet, F-35 that are so good, you can't see it. And I went to see the program, and I met some of the pilots and these guys are better looking than Tom Cruise. They're tougher. They're stronger. They're bigger. They're more powerful. They're smarter. And I like Tom cruise by the way, because you can't get much better than Top Gun, right? Great movie. You can't get better. I like Tom cruise. But these guys are better looking than Tom. They got that crew cut, they got the crap under their eyes, they got the whole deal. They're smart as hell. So I said, ""So captain, let me ask you, how good is the F-35?"" ""They're really good Sir, best plane we've ever had all great."" I said, ""How do you compare that with what Russia has?"" ""Well, ours is better for a specific reason, Sir. You can't see it."" ""What does that mean?"" ""Well, when we fight, they cannot see us, that we are so stealth."" Now that doesn't mean in three years that it won't be obsolete because that's what happens. That's the problem with that business. You come up with a new computer and two weeks later it's obsolete. That's why I always like real estate, and grab a piece of real estate. But no, it's true. I wouldn't be good in that business. You get to work, work, work, and then you're starting the next one because the last one is gone. That's why I always talk about walls and wheels. When the Democrats were saying, ""Walls are old fashioned."" Well, they're right about that. But they work. Remember that? All we had to go through in Congress? And that wall is going up, think of that. We're building 10 miles a week, 10 miles a week of the top. And our numbers on the border are the best they've ever been. The best they've ever been. Well, we're building 10 miles of wall a week. We're up to about 330 miles, and we'll have it finished very soon, and it's having a tremendous impact on drugs. It's having a tremendous impact on all of the different things. Human trafficking in women. It's not even children. They're trafficking women, it's because of the internet. You think of that as almost an ancient kind of a crime, right? But it's not. It's a very modern crime and it's an unbelievably profitable crime. They're trafficking women, little bit children, but mostly women. Where they'll put three or four women in the back in the trunk of a car and they'll go through the border. They can't do it anymore. And we're catching them. We have people that do nothing but look for the traffickers. To me, the traffickers are the biggest scum of the world. And thank heavens for ICE, and thank heavens for border patrol because these people do a job that you don't want. I know Mike doesn't want it. You wouldn't even be good at it, Mike, he'll do a commercial about it. That's what he'll do. Does he have the longest commercials in history? I say, Mike Lindell. I say, Mike, the pillow man. I say, Mike is the single greatest purchaser of commercials in history. I want him to buy my commercials. I say, ""You know, we spent $20 million, I sell like two commercials."" He spends $2 and he's got the whole day on Fox. I said, let Mike buy our commercials. Will you? I don't know what the hell you do, but whatever it is, you better tell me the secret. Greatest purchaser of commercials. But we have done some job with that. And the traffickers and drugs are way down. Now we got upset with the pandemic, but I watched Biden today talking about, ""If only Trump moved one week sooner. One week."" So let's go, ready? So, you know he was against the ban, right? Because he didn't think we had a problem. So he was against the ban. He didn't know that China was heavily infected. He doesn't even know where China is, in my opinion. But he was against the ban. These guys write stuff out for him, and he tries to read it. Doesn't do well with it. So he was against it, but now his new thing is, if only I moved one week earlier, but I was earlier than everybody. If you think about it. I had nice guy, Dr. Fauci, I had another nice, got a lot of doctors. They were all telling me, ""No, no, you don't have to do that."" Tom knows that very well. ""You don't have to do that, Sir. You don't have to do that. You don't have to do that at all."" And one of those things, I was very early and I banned and everybody admits that had I not banned highly infected Wuhan province, right? Highly infected, we would have had hundreds of thousands of more deaths. And then you had the chart. I put it up yesterday, I'm doing these news conferences. We're finally getting the word across that we did a great job, but I'm doing news conferences now every day. I call them the highly rated news conferences. And I go before these crazy people, they're screaming like maniacs. It's not the way they treat Sleepy Joe. He'd melt. If they ever did a number on, this guy would be there he'd be laying on the floor crying, ""Get me out of here, Darling. Where is my wife? Get me out of here, please, Darling. They're so nasty to me today. What happened?"" We go through it every single day. But you think about it, and he said, ""If only Trump moved faster,"" but he's the one that two months later called me xenophobic, and he called me a racist because I was banning China, which was heavily infected. And then he said, ""Don't ban Europe."" Well, I looked at Italy, big problem. I love Italy. I love the people of Italy, but they were heavily infected. France, I looked at France, I looked at Spain, they even had spikes recently. Did you see? And we're doing great. We're rounding it with or without, but we're going to have with, but you know, with his better, but with or without, we're rounding that corner, and we're rounding it fast and they don't want to give us any credit because they want to keep this up 'til November 4th. And on November 4th, the press will probably say, let's say something stupid happened. The press will say, ""I got to admit he did a damn good job."" And the other clown will be in office. We did a thing called price transparency. I signed it. It's effective, also very complicated. It's on your medical. And we did price transparency. It's the biggest thing. It's bigger than healthcare. Where you see your prices. You can go now to hospitals, you can price operations, you can price everything. It's a massive thing. The man who did it… And I took a lot of heat, and I'm doing favorite nations drugs, meaning whatever the lowest in the world is, we have to pay the same. That's the good news. The bad news is the drug companies, the doctors everybody's angry at me. Actually under price transparency, the good hospitals and the good doctors benefit tremendously, but the bad ones don't, and you have price transparency. And it goes into effect on January 1st. Could you imagine if this sleepy guy gets in and they say like, February, March, April something. They say unbelievable what happened to prices, it's dropping like crazy. And they'll say, what a job he's doing this president? And I'm the one that signed it. I said, could you put it into effect but statutorily? It has to mature, mature, mature. So the earliest I could get is January 1st. It's like crazy. You know another one? I'll give you another one. I'll give you another one. So Air Force One, so that's the 757, but they have a 747, which is the big Air Force One. I think that just disrespected the people of Minnesota today, they gave us the little one. No, actually it's because of the runway. In fact, when we landed, they said, ""Sir, we have a very short runway, could you please hold on? I said, ""I trust these pilots."" By the way, these pilots are the best pilots. When you fly the president of the United States. Wait a minute, he's waving from the window. When you fly the president of the United States, you are the best flyer. They take the best air force guys, they take the best Marines in the helicopters, Marine One. But when you're flying these planes, you can land that sucker, you have no problem. There's no, mishits. There's no, ""Let's go around. I can't quite make it, Sir."" These guys are phenomenal. You've got to see what they look like. Everyone's in perfect shape. I look at him, central casting, every one of them they're great. Thank you fellas. Thank you. But I'll tell you a little story. So Air Force One is a very old plane. It's beautiful, but it's an old 747, right? It's 31 years old and other people didn't want to do it, but it was time to get a new one. It was time. You got to get a new plane. And actually Air Force One, I'll give you a little secret, it's actually two planes. They get two. It's a hell of a way to travel. If one's not working perfect, you use the other one. But they get two. So Air Force One, they negotiated a price and they had it down for $5.7 billion, that was not sounds expensive, and it's ridiculous, but that was done by the Obama administration. It was done by the Obama administration. And that's okay. But no administration Obama, Bush, they didn't want to do it because it sounds luxury. But at some point you got to buy a plane for the country. And these Arab countries would have their beautiful 747, 800s, 900s pour in, and they were gorgeous. And believe it or not, the new plane is a much bigger plane. Much bigger wingspan, it's a much more beautiful plane, it's modern. I think of a 31 years old, Air Force One is 31 years old, the main Air Force One, not this. This is a great plane, but the big one 31 years old. So you're representing the country, but they didn't want to do it because it shows luxury for two planes, in all fairness. Now it's very technical, there's a lot of stuff. I won't talk about it because I don't want to give away any classified information. Just trust me, some more sophisticated sucker you've ever seen in your life. I think you're getting into a plane that cost 5.7 billion. Right? But it's the most sophisticated, two planes. So I said, ""How much is it? A general came, and an air force general, great guy, handsome guy. They're all so good looking these people. I said, ""So general, what are we paying? What's the price?"" "" Sir, it's $5.7 million and we're ready to go, Sir, could you sign it?"" It sounds like a lot of money to me, General, 5.7 million for two airplanes. Can we get a better price?"" ""No, sir. This was negotiated by the Obama administration. The Obama administration. This was negotiated, Sir, by Barack Hussein Obama."" And I said, ""Oh, that's good. It sounds very high. So here's what I'm going to do. Tell Boeing we're not taking the plane. We have no interest in, it's too much."" This is what I did. By the way, this is one of many stories. Isn't this better than going and saying, ""I saved your Iron Range?"" And I say, ""But please remember I did this too."" And I can do away with this stuff, but I did this too. Please remember that because I have all this list of incredible things I've done for Minnesota, I won't even touch it because frankly I'm tired of repeating what I've done for all these different states. I mean, I did all this stuff and then I hear I'm nine down. I don't believe it by the way, suppression. So I said to the general, I said, ""General, 5.7 billion, not million, billion. That sounds very high to me general. I bought a lot of planes in my life and a lot of helicopters. I know a lot about it. How could it be five?"" ""Sir, that's the best price they could get. We only have one day to do it."" I said, ""Cancel it General. Cancel the order."" It was signed actually. ""Yes, Sir."" I said, ""Do you have the right to cancel it?"" ""Yes, sir. I do."" We negotiated a great deal. I said, ""Oh good. Cancel it."" ""Yes, sir. I'm pleased to tell you something, Sir. We have a breakup fee. We made a great deal, Sir."" I said, ""You did? Oh, you have a breakup fee. You mean you can't just cancel it for nothing? Then cancel it. You don't have to pay a breakup fee. I know about breakup fees."" ""No, Sir, we have a breakup fee."" ""Okay. How much is it?"" ""Sir, we can break it up for $250 million."" I said, ""Wait a minute. So you mean to tell me that to cancel the order costs $250 million?"" In other words, we give them $250 million, we get nothing. I said, ""General, don't cancel the order. Just tell him I'm very unhappy."" This is what these guys. They're good businessmen, by the way. These guys, right here, Mike, they might be better than you. I don't even know. He may be the next governor. Mike Landell, maybe you should run. You should run. He is my complete and total investment. You should run. He'd be a hell of a governor. At least, you know one thing. Minnesota would be well promoted. Mike, run for governor, please. So he says, ""It's $250 million. It's 250, Sir, I'm so proud of that."" I said, ""You may be proud, but I'm not."" So I said, ""General, don't give them notice because I don't want to write a check for 250 and getting nothing. I don't think I could explain that to the American public. So tell them you're really unhappy, we're not going to make the deal, but just do it verbally."" And, ""Yes, sir."" And then I spoke to the head of Boeing, a very nice guy. They had some rough times since then. They had a couple of really bad things happen. Terrible, really terrible. This was early on before the problems that they had. But he is, he's a high quality guy. And I said to him, ""Dennis, we have to start it with a… It's got to have a three on the front of it."" What do I know? I just know that if they're 5.7, and if I do something with a three. He said, ""No, I can bring it down to 5.5 billion."" So I say, ""Well, that's not bad. I save $200 million in about a minute and a half phone call. So so far I'm not good, but it's not good enough. I'm not happy."" I said, ""No, we got to really think about canceling it."" And I can't go to Airbus, which is made in Europe. It's a little hard, I got to go to their competitor. I can't say I'm going to buy the Air Force One from a European company that doesn't work too well. My only option was to say, ""Look, I just don't want to just put it aside."" He calls me up a few days later. ""Well, we can do a little bit better than that."" I said, ""Dennis, has to have a three in front of it, Dennis."" Got to have a three. Like a three, three anything, but got to have a three in front of it. So he said, ""No, no, no."" After one month, we signed a contract for $3.9 billion. Same exact one. Actually slightly better, we got an extra generator. And then Boeing came to me, and I love to negotiate. I do. Got that from my father. My father was a good negotiator and I love to negotiate. So they came to me, ""Sir, we can put an extra stairway."" This is the big 747. And remember this is a big, much bigger than the old 747. ""Sir, it gets very windy up there. I noticed that your hair's blown all over the place. But we can buy a stairwell for the plane. And it comes under, it's like a corkscrew right at the bottom of the plane."" You're very high off the ground, big, big thing. ""And it opens up, and if it's raining or windy, you're covered, Sir, because it's under the plane. You're totally sheltered."" I said, ""That sounds great. So it's a corkscrew stairwell."" I said, ""How much is that general?"" ""50."" I said, ""50, what a deal, So for $50,000 I can get a stairway?"" ""No, sir. $50 million."" I said, ""Forget about the stairwell. Forget it."" He said 50. I really thought he meant $50,000. So these are just some little stories. I guess I must like Minnesota to go on one of these deals. But boy, did you get your money's worth tonight? Is anybody having a bad time? Did you get your money's worth? Because you've heard the other one. We've done this, and we've cut your taxes, and we built up the military bigger and better. And we're the number one in history in regulation cuts, which is the biggest thing. And the judges, which we've done at a level like nobody's ever done, everything we've done. Nobody has done more in three and a half years, no administration three and a half. Those first three and a half years, nobody even comes close. And you know, it's a funny thing. I say it all the time. I've been saying it for a long time and the fake news, nobody even questions me about it. And you know if I was wrong, they would, but they can't question me because when you see right to try, we took care of our vets. We just got a 91% approval rating from the vets 91. It's never happened before. We got choice approved, we got accountability approved, drugs are way down. We've got a little setback with this whole situation where these shutdowns cause a lot of problems with drugs, a lot of everything, but drugs were way down. We had our best year in the history of our country last year. And we're going to have a better year coming up. That's why you have an obligation to vote for the guy that got you there. And remember this, and I really appreciate this, thank you. But I appreciate this because nine democrat mayors of cities in the Iron Range have endorsed me over Sleepy Joe. What do you like better? Sleepy Joe or Slow Joe? What's better? Let's do a poll. We do a poll. We do a poll. I do free falls. You know, these polls, they charge you a fortune for this stuff. They interviewed three people and then they charge you a million dollars. We interviewed 233 people, I got thousands of people at least for free. What do you like better as nickname? Slow Joe or Sleepy Joe? So let's go. Wait, Slow Joe first. Okay? So just scream if you like it. So you have a choice, Slow Joe, they're both very appropriate. Slow Joe or Sleepy Joe, ready? Slow Joe. I think we're going to have a winner here. Sleepy Joe based steel, real crap. It wasn't that, but when you think of it, they wrote it out. You didn't have environmentally the right. Somebody said, ""Oh, well he got a bit because he was good with negotiating with these other countries."" It wasn't that. I opened it up. I signed an order. I signed an executive order because Obama took your Iron Range and Biden took your Iron Range away. And I'll never forget. The day I did it, and Tom was there, a man, I don't know who he is, he's probably in this massive audience, but he came up to me and he was a rough guy and he never cried in his life, including at childbirth. He didn't cry at childbirth, but he was crying. And he said, ""Sir, you gave our life back to us because Obama took our heart out when he closed up the Iron Range."" He said you gave our heart back. It's true. So I just want to thank those cities. When a democrat mayor, and we have now a lot of… Now we have additional. So these are democrat politicians and two weeks ago they endorsed us, and it's a great thing. We're finding that all over the country. Democrats for Trump. Politicians that got elected as democrats, I don't think they changed their party affiliation, but they endorsed Trump. They're all in the Iron Range area. And Larry Cuffe is here. Larry Cuffe. Where's Larry? Where is he? Larry, how are you? Why did you do that, Larry? That's so nice. I appreciate it. Boy, are you good. I wish you had a mic. He said, ""Because you're the best candidate we could ever…"" I love this guy. Said you're the best candidate we could ever hope for. Thank you Larry, that's beautiful. I appreciate it. We'll do a good job. We're not going to let you down. And they're doing a good job over there. So dig in, dig in, dig we must, right? It's all going because of me. That's cool, man. Thank you. No, he signed an executive order shutting it down. Just shutting it down. And I hear it's got the best iron ore anywhere in the world. That's what I hear. The quality is the best. … or anywhere in the world. That's what I hear. The quality is the best. And it's like an unlimited amount. I'm talking about a little, this is a massive operation with thousands of people and everything else. And for me, it was very easy. Andrea Zupancich, where is she? Where's Andrea? Thank you very much. That's really nice. I'm glad that at least you got a good location, right? That's great. I appreciate it very much. You're all friends I guess. Chris Vreeland, where's Chris? Chris Vreeland. Chris? Where's Chris? The mayor? Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Chris. Thank you very much. Kathy Brandau. Kathy Brandau. Thank you, Kathy. I hope you're having a good time tonight. We're not going to let you down. You know that. We're open. That sucker is open. We're not closing it. Well, think of this though. If Biden gets in, it's closed. He said he's going to close it. How about this guy? No fracking. You're not going to frack. Onstage with all these crazy people and they don't want any energy. They think everything's going to run by wind, which costs you a fortune, about 20 times more than what we have and doesn't work. But think of it, all of these people… And they say, ""What about fracking? Fracking is the modern technology. And so they all said, ""No, no, we're all against… everyone's against fracking. What about you?"" Yes, I'm against it too. Now he's against it for months. He gets it, now he's in favor of it. But he's sort of grandfathering it. You know, it's a very weak… Well, I like to grandfather fracking. If I'm a fracker, I don't want to be grandfather. I want to have it or not have it, right? He wants to grandfather fracking. Always go with their first statement, okay? So I was in Texas two weeks ago, we had crowds. Mike, we had crowds that went from the airplane to the well, to the drilling well, where we went to see a well. And we saved the industry because I got Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut back 10 million barrels. It actually was probably 18. Ended up being, I think, 18.5 million barrels. And it saved the industry. And yet you're still paying very low gasoline prices at the pump, but we saved 10 million jobs. But I'm in Texas, and let me tell you, Texas appreciated it because that industry was in deep trouble because all of a sudden with the pandemic, there was no demand. There was nobody driving, there was no demand. Nobody ever saw anything like it. So I'm in Texas and I said to the crowd, it was a great crowd, and we must have had a hundred thousand people on the road, on the highways and roadways waving. And they had the most beautiful Trump flags. I wanted to stop, ""Where did you buy that flag?"" The most beautiful flags of me and our great vice president. Is Mike Pence doing a good job by the way? He did such a great… he worked 29 hours a day. I mean, this guy works day and night. He worked not the 24. He worked 24 plus least five, okay. This man is a worker and he's a wonderful human being. And when they try it, a guy like Biden that can't carry his jockstrap. When Biden goes, ""Oh, they should have closed one week earlier"", and here's the guy that said I made a mistake when I banned China that nothing's going to happen. It's so phony. This politics is a very phony business. I haven't been doing it long. I told one of the senators that came in, he came into my office there, "" I've been doing this for 30 years. I've won many elections, I've only lost twice in my life. I've been a Senator for a long time. I know what I'm doing, sir"". I said, ""Yeah, and I've done it for four years. And I've only won one election, but it's for the president of the United States."" I remember a certain man on television that didn't like me too much. He said, ""They put together the greatest field ever assembled, the Republicans, remember? 17 plus me. They put together the greatest field of talent ever assembled. I hear Trump wants to come in. He's not going to do it number one. Number two, if he does, he's just doing it for fun and he'll be out by September and then he'll go about leading his life, but he's not going to do it. But we don't really need him because this is the greatest single assemblage of talent ever assembled for one party."" The greatest talent he's ever seen. And then I did it and just week after week, one out, two out, three out, four out. And then we've done changes. Oh, he said, ""He can't do it because he doesn't have any experience."" But I actually do on the other side. I contributed to politics. I always found it very interesting. So in a certain way, I had a lot of experience probably. Maybe I had too much experience. That's why I can tell you about AOC. Check out the $2 million please, check it out, check it out. Check out Omar, check out Omar, get to that great writer, he should get… Oh, so the New York Times won all these Pulitzer prizes, right? I was going to tell you before. All these Pulitzer prizes, these people, and they all got it wrong, right? They got for Russia, Russia, Russia. We give the Pulitzer prize. I won't use names. I won't use names, but we give the Pulitzer prize to the New York Times. They got it wrong. We give the Pulitzer prize to the Washington Post and all of these real sleazebags. I have to be honest with you. Very dishonest people, very dishonest. I call it the Amazon Washington Post. He uses that as his lobbyist because he owns the Washington Post. He gets crap that other people wouldn't get, okay. That means it's a lobby. It's a lobbyist deal. But they got the prize, right? They got the Pulitzer prize. All the guys that got it right, that really got it right, they all got it wrong, totally wrong. And they should return the Pulitzer prize. And Pulitzer association, the committee should ask for those prizes back. They got it all wrong. They were a hundred percent wrong. There was no collusion. They couldn't believe. Remember the day when it was announced after three years, there is no collusion. I could have told them that a day one, they could have saved 48 million dollars. They got the Pulitzer. And then you take guys so many, so many. Solomon, Sara Carter, Bongino. How about Dan Bongino? So many, so talented guys. How about that great gentlemen who wrote The Witch Hunt? Remember that? That was the first, right? You know what I'm talking about. He's fantastic. All great. These people should have won the Pulitzer prize. Now I would say Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs and Laura and Tucker. In all fairness, Tucker was very good. Tucker was great, but these are all people that got it right. Now they don't do I guess the Pulitzer prize for that stuff, but they probably should. But these guys all got it right. And all they did was get a lot of money because they're very successful, and that's okay I guess. But they should give the Pulitzer prize to the people that got it right and they should withdraw from all of those writers, many of whom are back there right now, all of those writers, they should do that. And a candidate for Congress, Michelle Fischbach, who's supposed to be fantastic. And Michelle has my complete and total endorsement. But Jason, you're in good shape, wow. You're in better shape than these Congressman Jase. By the way, Jason is fantastic and he's doing a fantastic… Where's Michelle? Is she there? Be careful. It's not worth the broken legs. Look at her. Oh, she's a warrior, I can tell. Come on up. But thanks, Michelle. And they have my complete endorsement. They're great people. They love your state. They love our country. So just in conclusion, I want to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. And you probably heard me today. It used to be Puerto Rico did tremendous dollars in medical supplies. And then what happened? They made a lot, they did a good job, and Obama Biden destroyed it. They took away the incentive, all of the taxes. And they took away the incentive and Puerto Rico went down a long way. We'll get some of that back to Puerto Rico and we'll get it back for us. Take it away from China. You heard that, yes? They took it away. And then people automatically vote. It's like a habit. Will I vote for the Democrat? The Democrat was so bad to you. And how bad were the Democrats to Israel? We did Jerusalem, right? We broke up the Iran deal, right? And then they vote for a Democrat. It's out of habit, but I think the habits, we're breaking those habits very quickly. But we've helped Puerto Rico and we've really helped… If you look at what we've done for Israel, it's been incredible. They say nobody's done more. And it's my honor. But we'll hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities, which are a disaster. We'll appoint tough on crime prosecutors. We will nominate judges and justices who interpret the constitution as written. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. And that's why the Supreme court is so important. The next president will get one, two, three, or four Supreme court justices. I had two. Many presidents have had none. They've had none because they're there for a long time. They tend to be appointed young. They're there for a long time. But the next one we'll have anywhere from one to four. Think of that. That will totally change when you talk about life, when you talk about second amendment, when you talk about things that are so important to you. You're going to be stuck for 40 years, 35 years, a long time. So this is going to be the most important election, in my opinion, in the history of our country. You got to get it right. Because if you don't get it right, we will not have a country anymore. You're not going to have a country. Not as we know it. You won't have a country anymore. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, horrible, endless foreign wars. Countries you've never heard of. Coming home. We will maintain America's unrivaled military mind, and we will ensure peace through strength. This is what we have now. Peace through strength. Remember what I told you about those weapons, we don't want to use ever, we don't want to use those weapons. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, January 1st. He doesn't even have to do anything now. I'll be so angry if he… They'll say, ""What a job he's done on transparency, can you believe it?"" And he won't even know what transparency is. And it's complex. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We've done that already. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And we brought NASA back. NASA, when I got in three and a half years ago, grass was growing through the cracks of the runway. It was over, it was closed. It was nothing. Now it's the number one space center in the entire world by a factor of five. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. You know that the Democrat national convention and the pledge of allegiance at a caucus, two of them, not one. I heard the first one, I said, ""Oh, they must've made a mistake."" They left under God out of the pledge of allegiance. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now they then said, ""Oh, well we didn't mean that."" They meant it. That's what they're going to do. They're going to take God out of it. Just like I was saying before, Texas, they don't want God, they don't want oil, they don't want guns. I don't think they're going to do too well in Texas. Do you agree with that? I don't think they're going to do too well in Minnesota either. No, but could you imagine you're campaigning, and it doesn't play too well here, but could you imagine you're in Texas and you have a guy say, ""No oil, no God, no guns. Oh, I think I'm going to vote for Joe Biden, everybody."" And then they say, ""Texas is in play, it's a very close…"" I have a friend in Texas. He said, ""I think you're winning by 15 points."" These people are crazy. Texas is in play. They don't want to let you have oil. Think of it. It's unbelievable. Texas is in play. That's the fake news back there. They said it last time too. Remember? Texas, when they say in play, that means it's too close to call. It's in play. Too close. We've heard that for a long time, in play, right? Too close to call. And they said it four years ago, ""Texas is in play. This could be a terrible defeat, losing Texas. Big state, great state. This would be a tremendous defeat."" And they said it about Ohio too. I think we won by like nine points. Right? They said Ohio is in play. Utah's in play. We won by a lot. Remember we beat a guy named McMuffin. Remember the guy? He was going to take the state of Utah. And then he was going to be able to negotiate. But that didn't work out. He came in third. Even Hillary beat him. But they said Texas is in play. And I'd go around telling my people, ""Damn it, Texas is in play, how the hell? Every time I go there, I have 35,000 people at the stadium, how could it possibly be in play?"" They said it's in play. My people would say, ""I don't think so."" And we had a big Texas rancher. He was on one of the shows. He was wearing a big, beautiful hat. I wish I could wear those hots. It wouldn't work for me too well. I don't think it works for me, right? But it worked for him. And he said, ""I don't know too much about a lot, but I know one thing. Texas is not in play. And this guy is going to win Texas by a hell of a lot of votes."" And that's what happened that night, the night of the election. The night of the election, they called the results. I've been listening for six months, ""Texas is so close, we can't even imagine it it's so close. This is big."" And they only call the election immediately if you win in a landslide, it's got to be tremendous. And they said, ""Texas has closed its doors. Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the state of Texas."" They didn't even say the polls were closed. They forgot to say the polls were closed. I wanted to say. I said, ""How come I won?"" I called my people, ""How could I have won? It was so close they called it before they even said the doors closed."" And I heard from the governor of Texas, great guy, Greg Abbott. I said, ""How are we doing compared to four years ago?"" We did great four years ago, big, big win. He said, ""Sir, you're doing much better."" But these guys keep saying it's in play. It's the same way that I'm down nine points in Minnesota. If I lose Minnesota, if I lose Minnesota, Jason, I'm going to blame Jason if I lose. Boy, we almost had it last time. But we did the right thing. We went to Michigan, we won Michigan, first time in many, many years, that Michigan was won. It's a great state. For years you had a president who apologized for America. And now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for Minnesota. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote. And you know it's starting today in Minnesota. That's why I'm here. It started today. Go out of here. You know what? If they're closed, what the hell time is it now? If they're closed, just stand in line like you do. People were here two days ago trying to get in here. It's crazy. So do the same thing at the voting booth, please. From St. Paul to St. Cloud, from Rochester to Duluth, and from Minneapolis, thank God we still have Minneapolis, to right here, right here with all of you great people, this state was pioneered by men and women who braved the wilderness and the winters to build a better life for themselves and for their families. They were tough and they were strong. You have good genes. You know that, right? You have good genes. A lot of it's about the genes, isn't it? Don't you believe? The resource theory you think was so different? You have good genes in Minnesota. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury, but they had grit, they had faith, and they had each other. That's what you have now. You have each other. They were miners and lumberjacks, fishermen and farmers, shipbuilders and shopkeepers. But they all had one thing in common. They loved their families, they loved their countries, and they loved their God. Proud citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we're going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And don't forget, you went through years where you weren't winning, right? Years and years, they closed down. Even with Obama, he closed that iron. I think he just wanted to get even with you, I don't know. He wasn't good. Not a good… We've knocked out about 84% of the things he did. Then you say, ""I wonder if he likes me?"" But you're getting used to winning and you're going to see winning like you've never seen before. You had your best year and you're going to win so much. You've heard this, right? I haven't said it in a long time because we've been doing a lot of winning, but you're going to win so much. And you're going to send Jason to the US Senate. And you're going to keep winning and winning and winning. You're going to win on trade, you're going to win on the military. You're going to win on everything you touch. Minnesota is going to keep on winning and you're going to get tired of winning because Minnesota doesn't want to win all the time. Your football team is going to win in the big 10 they say, right? No, we are going to keep on winning in Minnesota. And you're going to get so tired you're going to say, ""Jason, Jason, please, please Jason, go to the president. See him in the oval office. Stop him from winning. We're winning too much in Minnesota. We can't stand it. Jason, please, please Jason. Stop him from winning so much for Minnesota. We can't take it. We're not used to it because we went through years and years and years where it was tough"", right? The mayors know that. That's why they all endorsed the president. And I'm going to look at Jason, I'm going to say, ""No, Jason, I'm sorry. The people of Minnesota want to win, you're wrong, Jason. They want to win. We're going to keep on going, Jason, we're going to keep on winning. And they're going to be happy as hell, Jason."" Get Jason in, he's a great guy. By the way, you have a Senator that he's running against. I won't even mention names. She does nothing, nothing. Nobody even knows who the hell she is. She goes to a meeting the other day, everyone's trying to figure out who is she? This guy… he even looks the role. Central casting, right? If you can get the look for free, that's good too. Right? But he's going to be fantastic. Tremendous guy, really successful. And he loves your state and he loves our country. So Jason, please knock them out. Knock them out. But you're going to win. We're one movement. We're one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Minnesota, and you know what's going to be operating at strength? Because I owe it to these incredible mayors that were so nice to me. That was such a nice thing. And I didn't politick you at all. I never politicked you. I said how nice. And it's happening with so many other things. We have other endorsements from police forces that I never asked and all of a sudden they're coming from very hostile territory. So I just appreciate your being here. And I'm saying this for you and I'm saying it for all of you. Okay. Thank you. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you Minnesota, thank you."
Trump,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All I can say is that the fake news just doesn't get it, do they? They don't get it. They just don't get it. Hello Charleston, and I'm thrilled to be back in the great state of South Carolina with thousands of hardworking American Patriots who believe in faith, family, God, and country. Thank you. It's a phenomenal crowd, only topped by the number of people outside that didn't get in. If anybody would like to give up where you're standing or your seat, please raise your hand. All right. Then let's begin, right? Thank you all very much though. This is great. No, they don't get it. Down the road, they have a rally for one of the people that are going to be running tomorrow. They're trying to get to a hundred, but they're not going to make it. So I think they're going to set up a round table. Well, that's what they do. So people want to go to a rally, they end up sitting at a round table talking about their definition of impeachment. Crazy. No, it's crazy. Crazy! It's a crazy deal. No, the fake news media, they've been trying to figure this out for years. They still don't get it though. They don't get it. Look at all of those cameras. Look at all of those cameras. That's a lot of cameras. That's a lot of cameras, Lindsey and Tim, that's a lot of… They heard you guys were here. They heard Tim was here and that Lindsey was here and that… And they said, ""We're not going to attend that rally,"" but when we heard those two guys plus our great congressmen, they're here, great congressmen. But this is an incredible time for our nation. We're thrilled to be in the midst of what we call the Great American Comeback and that's what it is. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, factories are returning, poverty is plummeting, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military. Our country is stronger than ever before. We are stronger, we are better, but while we are building a great future, the radical left Democrats in Washington are trying to burn it all down. They have spent the last three years, and I can even go further than that, three years since the election, but we go before the election, working to erase your ballots and overthrow our democracy. But with your help, we have exposed the far left's corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and let's see what happens in the coming months. Let's watch. Let's just watch. Very dishonest people. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they're politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ""How's President Trump doing?"" They go, ""Oh, not good, not good."" They have no clue. They don't have any clue. They can't even count their votes in Iowa. They can't even count. No, they can't. They can't count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, ""Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia."" That didn't work out too well. They couldn't do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They'd been doing it since you got in. It's all turning. They lost. It's all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But we did something that's been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early. We went early, we could have had a lot more than that. We're doing great. Our country is doing so great. We are so unified. We are so unified. The Republican party has never ever been unified like it is now. There has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now. Never been a movement. So a statistic that we want to talk about, go ahead. Say USA. It's okay. USA. So a number that nobody heard of, that I heard of recently and I was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. Did anyone know that? 35,000, that's a lot of people. It could go to 100,000, it could be 27,000. They say usually a minimum of 27, goes up to 100,000 people a year die. And so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States. Nobody. And it doesn't mean we won't and we are totally prepared. It doesn't mean we won't, but think of it. You hear 35 and 40,000 people and we've lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode. CNN fake news and the camera just went off, the camera. The camera just went off. Turn it back on. Hey, by the way, hold it. Look at this, and honestly, all events are like this. It's about us. It's all about us. I wish they'd take the camera, show the arena please. They never do. They never do. They never do it. They never show the arena. You can hear it because when you hear it, that's not 200 people. That's not a hundred people. That's thousands and thousands of people including people outside. You can hear it. They always show my face. See that face? They show my face. I want them to show the arena, not my face, right? How many have you been to? How many rallies have you gone? Practically every one. Can you believe it? I'm sure your husbands are thrilled, right? They're thrilled. Where are you going tonight? I'm going to another Trump rally. Cool. Number 114. What do your husbands say about that? This group up here. She said, ""We don't care."" Thank you. Thank you. Democrats will only say horrible things even though they know we're doing a great job. We're doing a great job with what we have to work with. It's incredible. The Democrats want us to fail so badly. Even if their actions, and you take a look, hurt the people of this country, they'll hurt the people themselves, their wealth, their everything. They're willing to hurt our country in order to say bad, even if they know it's not so. We made an unbelievable deal with Mexico, with Canada, with China, with South Korea, with Japan. And if you put a microphone with these people back there like the Academy Awards used to be, not anymore. Best movie of the year. It's made in South Korea. What's that all about? I'm waiting to see the best movie of the year- And it's made… He said, ""It's garbage."" Only in South Carolina can you say that. Only in South Carolina. You're going to get us in trouble. No, I'm just repeating what he said for the fake news. No, but seriously the Academy Awards has gone way, way down in ratings. Do you know why? Because they started attacking us and we don't believe in it anymore. That's why. No, but they had the best movie of the year made in South Korea. They make enough stuff for us, right? And they're good. They're our friends. Take advantage of us, that's okay. Not so much anymore. We are really, you take a look, magnificently organized with the best professionals in the world. We're prepared for the absolute worst. You have to be prepared for the worst, but hopefully it will all amount to very little. That's why I tell you when we have the flu with 35,000 people and this one we have to take it very, very seriously. That's what we're doing. We are preparing for the worst. My administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States. We are ready. We are ready. Totally ready. On January 31st, I ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering the United States. An action which the Democrats loudly criticized and protested and now everybody's complimenting me saying, ""Thank you very much. You were 100% correct."" Could've been a whole different story. But I say, so let's get this right. A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn't spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes, and the Democrats' single talking point, and you see it, is that it's Donald Trump's fault, right? It's Donald Trump's fault. No, just things that happened. But you know what this does show you? Things happen. Whoever thought of this two weeks ago? Who would've thought this could be going on four weeks ago? You wouldn't. But things happen in life and you have to be prepared and you have to be flexible and you have to be able to go out and get it. And my guys that we have the best professionals in the world, the best in the world and we are so ready. At the same time that I initiated the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We had a quarantine some people. They weren't happy, they weren't happy about it. I want to tell you there are a lot of people that not so happy, but after two weeks they got happy. You know who got happy? The people around them got happy. That's who got happy. I also created a White House virus task force. It's a big thing, a virus task force. I requested 2.5 billion dollars to ensure we have the resources we need. The Democrats said, ""That's terrible. He's doing the wrong thing. He needs eight and a half billion, not two and a half."" I've never had that before. I ask for two and a half, they want to give me eight and a half, so I said, ""I'll take it."" Does that make me a bad… I'll take it. I'll take it. I never had that before. I never had it. We want two and a half million. That's plenty. We demand you take eight and a half. He doesn't know what he's doing. We want eight and a half. These people are crazy. We must understand that border security is also health security. And you've all seen the wall has gone up like magic. It's gone up like magic. You think that was an easy one? That was not an easy one. It's going up great and we're up now 132 miles and this is the exact wall that border security, water, everything. This is everything they wanted, 132 miles already. We'll have 500 miles built by very early next year sometime. One of the reasons the numbers are so good. We will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country. We have no choice. Whether it's the virus that we're talking about or many other public health threats, the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans. Now you see it with the coronavirus, you see it. You see it with the coronavirus. You see that. When you have this virus or any other virus or any other problem coming in, it's not the only thing that comes in through the border. And we're setting records now at the border. We're setting records. And now just using this, so important, right? So important. I'm doing well in the polls despite the worst fake news and worst presidential harassment in the history of the United States. We've got phenomenal numbers. No, it's true. The worst presidential harassment in history. We had a great event yesterday, an event that was so beautiful, young African American leaders. One of the things I asked them, and I've been thinking about this for a long time… And great people, great people. Some of them are here tonight. Do you like the name African American or Black? And they said, ""Black!"" all at the same time. No, true. I tell you. Because you say, ""African American or Black?"" And they said almost immediately, ""Black."" But we had an incredible group of people and what happened is NBC… It was such a love fest. It was so incredible. It went on for 45 minutes. It was a love fest. It was incredible. NBC turned down… There they are right there. They turned down… Comcast, which owns NBC… Actually NBC, I think, we call it MSDNC, right? MSDNC. But NBC I think is worse than CNN. I actually do. And Comcast, a company that spends millions and millions of dollars on their image… I'll do everything possible to destroy their image because they are terrible. They are terrible. They're a terrible group of people. And they paid me a fortune for years for the Apprentice. They paid me a fortune. And when I left the show, it was doing great. When I left the show, 14 seasons, think of that, they got a big movie star. I won't tell you his name. Nobody would know. Actually nobody will know his name because he was on for such a short period of time. But the show went down the tubes very quickly after they had Trump. But the country in five years from now, of course you want to upset them, five years or nine years or 13 years. Or 18 years! 10 more years. Nah. Oh, they go crazy when you say it. When you say to them five more years, so it's five, but you then say maybe nine, maybe 13, maybe 17, maybe 21, or not, maybe 21. Let's do this. Let's term limit ourselves at 25 years. No more than 25 years. No more. Okay. They'll pass something in the Senate. Tim, pass it in the Senate with Lindsey, a 25 year term limit please. 07. While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with these vile hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, and lifting up citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We added another 225,000 jobs last month alone. And that makes seven million jobs since our election, seven million. The unemployment rate in the great state of South Carolina. You ever hear of that place? Now Sleepy Joe would say, ""The unemployment rate in the great state of Ohio…"" No, no. You're in South Carolina. Joe! Joe, you're in South Carolina. Come up. You ever see the guy with the note, ""No, no, it's South Carolina! It's not Ohio."" Okay. Then he goes, ""All right, Iowa. Did you say Iowa?"" No. No. They did that seven times. If I did that once, it would be the end of the road, right? Be the end of the road. They'd say Trump has lost it. They like to say that anyway, I guess though. These people are bad people. Now, Sleepy Joe. Well, he's running tomorrow. No, but could you imagine if I said just a small fraction of the mistakes he makes, which are unbelievable? Every speech. I actually said the other night, I was watching him when he said about half the population wiped out with guns. I said, ""That's a horrible thing. That's the end of his evening. That's the end of his political career."" And then after the debate, they're revealing him and they said, ""Joe Biden had a great night last night."" I don't get it, Tim. The unemployment rate here in South Carolina has fallen to 2.3%, the lowest rate in your state's history. The lowest rate in all of America. It's the lowest rate in all of America. I said to a friend of mine, a Democrat, ""How's the race going tomorrow? Who's going to win?"" And he says, ""Mr. President…"" No, it's very interesting. He said something. This guy's a real political pro too, in all fairness, even though he's a Democrat. But I said, ""Who's going to win?"" He said, ""Honestly, sir, it doesn't matter. You are so far ahead in South Carolina that it's meaningless."" Meaningless. That's what they say. And in North Carolina too. In North Carolina, bunch of losers. The good citizens of South Carolina have had a front row seat to the extremism of the Democrat candidates. Whether it's this character that nobody ever heard of him. I'd never heard it. I thought I knew all the wealthy people. This guy Tom, Mr. Impeachment, how did that work out, Tom Hey, he spent millions and millions of dollars in Iowa, right? Millions. He got less than 1%. He got one third of 1%. I wrote a little note. Did you see it? It said, ""Tom, it's not so easy doing what I did. Is it?"" Not so easy. Not so easy. All you have to do is ask Mini Mike. He's in there for a fortune. He wished he never started. Mini Mike, he wished he never started. He said, ""Well, Trump can do it. I'm going to do it too."" Unfortunately it's not working out too well. Was that the worst debate performance in history? They had a big audience. Everybody wanted to see whether or not he was good at what we're supposed to be doing up here. He turned out to be a total catastrophe. 35 million people, can you believe that? That's a big audience. Very big. And what a killer. But this guy Steyer, he spends all this money. He's not that wealthy. He spends all of this money and you shouldn't waste your vote on him tomorrow. I have to be honest. By the way, are the Republicans allowed to vote anyway even though… Are you ready? You ready? Let's do it together. I assume this is okay from a campaign finance standpoint, I assume. Lindsey, Tim, our great congressmen, are we allowed to do this? So am I allowed to request… First we- Congressman, are we allowed to do this? Am I allowed to request … First, we have to figure out who would be the weakest candidate against President Trump. And then if it's legal, I always say if it's permissible by law, because they have so many little booby traps, but they only like getting the Republicans. Democrats skirt, right? But we'll see what happens about that. The Democrats. But let me ask you this. Lindsey, Tim, you're pros. These are two of the greatest guys I know. So let me ask you this. So I don't know what the record attendance is in this arena, but I was told that we broke it by a lot. And you got the people outside. Are we allowed to tell them who we would like them to vote for? Because you're allowed to skip. All right, so wait a minute, let's do a poll. We do this for the fake news back there. Ready? Who would be the best candidate for us? Not for them. We're ready. Ready? So let's go through them just quickly. We won't include Steyer because he's a loser. He's out, okay? We won't include him. Who would be the best? This is a real poll. This isn't one of those fake polls taken by … In all fairness, I love you, Fox, taken by Fox, the worst pollster. This guy … this pollster hates Trump's guts. I was losing the last election by a fortune. They said, ""He did great with women."" Everything was wrong. And they never replaced this guy. But watch this. You ready? So first we'll go … let's say sleepy Joe, right? Right? Then we'll go crazy Bernie. Then we'll go mini Mike. I think he's out of it. Should we include mini Mike or not? Mini Mike is gone. Mini Mike is gone. I think he's gone. He doesn't have a chance. So let's not talk … and he's not in your election anyways, so let's forget. So mini Mike, I hear mini Mike, by the way, has left. He's basically given up. That's what I hear. He gave up. He gave up. Now, I hope what I just said keeps him in. You know, he's the kind of a guy, he'll stay in because, ""I don't want to be wrong."" Mike, it's time to go home. Go home, Mike, and enjoy your life. Go home and spend some money on something horrible to people. They said, ""She's not dumb, but she's just damn mean. We can't vote for her."" She's a mean one. She is mean. So Pocahontas, should we leave her in or out? How about Klobuchar? Not going to happen. So really we're down to two candidates, right? Sleepy Joe Biden and crazy Bernie. So this is a poll. I guarantee you this. As much as they hate me, they hate me. They're going to put this all over the place. We have a poll of like 30,000 people inside and out. They're doing it outside, too. We have a poll. Are you ready? Who do I … So in other words, who's the weaker of the two? I'm not interested in who does better. No, no. I'm not interested … wait. Ready? In other words, who do I want to run against? Meaning … very simple. We put it into nice, simple language. Who the hell is easier to beat? So who is easier for us? Not me. For us to beat. Ready? Crazy Bernie? Or sleepy Joe? I don't know. I think maybe a crazy Bernie has it a little bit. Once more just quick. Ready? He said, ""It doesn't matter, you'll beat them all."" I hope so. I hope so. So who is easier to beat, crazy Bernie or sleepy Joe? They think Bernie's easier to beat. They think Bernie's easier to beat. So whether it's Bernie Sanders' plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Warren's plan. I told you that I had more Indian blood in me than her, even though I have none. I have none. Zero. I have none. I have none. I said I have more Indian blood in me than she has. And she choked. She said, ""I'm going to show. I'm going to show."" She hired this company and they went out and did a blood test. 1,024th, right? So that means I probably one somewhere down the line a million years ago. I'm telling you, that was horrible. She choked. We don't want a person to win that chokes. We don't want to choke artist, right? One thing you will say about me, I'm not a choker. With all these people for years, they're after me years. We can't have chokers. We can't have chokers as your president. So Elizabeth Warren's plan to eliminate America's borders. That's what she would … or mini Mike's plan to eliminate your Second Amendment and take away your guns. How about that? Mini Mike wants to take away your guns. The insanity of the Democrat party is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great new Republican party. This November, we are going to take back the House. We are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. I wonder what they say when they go down the road and they see these groups of 200 people. Seriously. I wonder what they say. They never talk about it. They'll say, ""Joe Biden had a fabulous crowd today."" Fabulous. So fabulous that there's like five people. And they'll leave and they'll say, ""President Trump had a smattering of applause."" Smattering. They use the word smattering a lot. This is not … let's let them hear it. This is not a … this is a big … this is not a smattering. It's not a smattering. Turn the cameras. That's not a smattering. That is not a smattering. I hate it. They say Donald Trump … In India, I hate to say this to you, but … so they actually have 129,000 seat stadium. Did you see it? The place was packed, and they did better than most. They gave me credit for 100,000. That was not bad. It's 129. The stadium holds 100. They had a field that's about three times … it's cricket. It's the biggest stadium. And they had 129. I was with the Prime Minister of India, Modi. Great guy, loved by the people of India. And we had an amazing thing. And I went in, and here's the problem. This is a big crowd. And normally I like talking about my crowds because I get the crowds like nobody, but I just got back from 140 or 50 or 60,000 people and now I'm coming here. What does this place hold, 15? It's hard to be enthused. You understand that? I may never be excited again about a crowd after going to India. Think of this, they have 1.5 billion people. We have 350, so we're doing pretty well, I'll tell you what, but I love this crowd, and I love that crowd too. Tell you they have a great love for … They have a great love. They have a great leader, and they have a great love for the people of this country. That was really a worthwhile trip. With us tonight are both of your incredible US Senators. Two incredible friends, two warriors. Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott, come up here. And by the way, Tim's incredible mother is right here in the front row. As they're doing that, they got this big … I was going to almost do a poll on the two of them, but we're not doing that. But Lindsey is a true fighter for South Carolina. Loves your state. And as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee … you know that, right? He's the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. So important. So important. Senator Graham has been leading the charge to help us confirm a record number of judges to uphold the Constitution as written. Lindsey was amazing, you remember, for Justice Brett Kavanaugh? Remember how badly he … Great job, Lindsey. Great job, man. Thank you. Senator Scott is a leading superstar. He's a superstar. But he is a leader in lowering healthcare costs like nobody has done it. People don't know, but in the last year, prescription drug prices came down for the first time in 51 years. And that was with no Democrat help. If we had the help, we could lower it by 50%. But we'll get their help. One of these days, they're going to get smart. Senator Scott provides world class care for our veterans. What he's done for our veterans is incredible. And bringing investment to distressed communities across our country through opportunity zones, including 135 right here in South Carolina. That's what it is. Tim Scott came to my office with an idea. He said, ""Opportunity zone."" I said, ""Tim, what the hell is that?"" What is it? Right, Tim? And he went through a whole big thing and I said, ""This maybe could work,"" and we tried it. It is an incredible success, and what he's done for this country is incredible. It's incredible. Lindsey. We'll start with Lindsey. Say a few words, please. Thank you. Well, that was quite a display, wasn't it? Now there's a lot of love in this room. A lot of people say to me, friends of mine, they've very successful. They'll say, ""How do you speak in front of 25,000 people and 10,000 people and all of this?"" You know why? There's such love in the room it's easy. No, it's true. There is such … I explained, they don't understand it, because they're not for doing that, but I say there is such unbelievable love in the room that it's easy to do. Very easy. Right? It's sort of easy to do. We're also thrilled to be joined by many more great leaders from across the state. And some of you maybe know I liked this guy for a long time, Governor Henry McMaster. Come up, Henry. Come up, Henry. Representatives Joe Wilson, Jeff Duncan, William Timmons, Ralph Norman, Tom Rice, and the Chairman of the South Carolina Republican party, Drew McKissick. As I introduce somebody, and I'll just say stay there because he was brave, but he got hit hard. He's a very special man, retired Marine Corps, major general, and most of you know he received the Congressional Medal of Honor, James E. Livingston. James, just relax. Where's James? He got hit hard. Thank you, James. Congressional Medal of Honor winner. Thank you, James. They are great brave people. You know, we have the Congressional Medal of Honor and we have the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and they're both the highest awards. One civilian, one is military. I always say getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom is much less painful because when I read them off, I'll read like with James or with so many of the Congressional Medal of Honors, many are not living, to be honest with you. And I'll read stories where one of them recently going up a hill, hit 19 times by gunfire, grabbing four people, bringing them down, getting onto a helicopter, falling out of the helicopter, hitting a tree on the way down. Hitting a tree. They went back and saved him, but he died later. I mean, those are tough deals. Those are tough deals. We have one right here who's living. We have one right here who's living. But they are tough. So thank you very much for being here. And maybe I could ask our governor, our great governor of this incredible state, to say a few words. Please, Henry. Thank you very much. And where's Alan? Is your son here? You're great son, Attorney General? Alan, thank you very much. Take good care of him, okay? Thank you. Thank you, Alan. And thanks to Republicans all over America. We are now working on things that nobody ever thought possible. Since my election, over 121,000 new jobs have been created right here in South Carolina. We've lifted 10 million people off welfare, including 7 million off of food stamps. And that's a good thing, not a bad thing. They're working and they have great jobs and they love getting up in the morning and they're making much more money and it costs our country nothing. We make money, they pay taxes. It's a whole different deal. Median household income has reached the highest level in the history of our country. The unemployment rate nationwide has hit the lowest rate in over 50 years. The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history. How about that one? It's a good one. That's a good one. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached record lows. Black youth unemployment has reached an all time low. Black poverty levels are the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country.  Paid family leave. Reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 more in their pocket thanks to the Republican Child Tax Credit. Republican, not Democrat. We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that decimated manufacturing all across your state and all across our country. For years, politicians sold you out to global special interests, enriching other countries at your expense. That ended. That ended. But I am not the president of the globe. I don't want to be the president of the world. I am the president of the United States of America.  reciprocal. Reciprocal. Got to be fair. After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. We are finally putting America first. On no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration. Every Democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens funded by you, the American taxpayer. They want to treat illegal aliens, people that come into our country illegally, better than they want to treat our military and our veterans. Not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury, but it threatens innocent lives. I recently invited to the White House the granddaughter of a 92 year old woman who was raped, beaten, brutalized, and murdered by an illegal alien who had previously been set free in New York City. Here in Charleston County, an illegal alien was recently charged with sexually assaulting a young girl in the fourth grade. In Berkeley County, officers captured a previously deported MS-13 gang member who shot a man to death before dousing the body in gasoline and setting him on fire. And he should have never been in our country. He shouldn't have been allowed. It's being built. It's being built. By the way, just in case you haven't heard, it is being built. That, you know. And they're going to go nuts. They're going to go nuts. They thought they got me. They said, ""Okay."" Have you heard them recently? ""Okay. He's building the wall."" And you think it's easy getting that kind of money to build a wall when I have a whole party and a deep State and some never-Trumpers? They're a dying breed though. The good thing, they're on respirator. They're on respirator. They're on mouth to mouth resuscitation. You can do it. I'm not doing it. They're on mouth to mouth resuscitation, the never-Trumpers. But you think it's easy. It's not. But that's been built. But you know what they say now. ""Okay. He's building the wall, but Mexico's not paying for it."" Yes they are, actually. They are. They are. They are paying for it. And some of the fake news knows that, but they refuse to report it, but that's okay. You'll see. You'll see what's going on. And I want to thank Mexico because, by the way, right now they have 27,000 soldiers on our border protecting our border. We have Mexico protecting our border. And they only do that for Trump. They don't do that for sleepy Joe. They don't do that for crazy Bernie. And they don't do it for mini Mike, that's for sure. They're only doing that for Trump, right? 27,000 soldiers protecting our border. In this region … … thousand soldiers protecting our border. In this region of the country alone last year, ICE … They've been treated so badly, right? They are great. They're brave. They're tough. Any men? There are tough guys in here, but anybody want to be an ICE officer? It's tough stuff, right? They go into those nests. They call them nest. That's where these guys get together and they knock the hell. I mean, if they have to … I have to be very careful. I don't want to get them in trouble, because the press wants us to be very politically correct. So let me change it around. They go into a nest of MS13, and they say, ""Oh, hello gentlemen. How are you?"" On occasion, they have a fight. They never lose those fights. We need people like that. ""Hello gentleman. How are you? How many people did you kill last year? How many people did you get kill last year with a knife,"" because they like knives because it's more painful. This is the kind of people that we were letting into our country. ICE has taken them out of our country by the thousands. By the thousands. Last year, ICE officers arrested 12,000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses, including robbery, rape and many for a thing called murder. On Wednesday we won the big case in federal court. Did you see that? Did you see that? We won the case unanimously. Unanimously. Federal appeals court, where we don't have to give money to sanctuary cities and States if they don't work with us, finally. Finally. Finally. Why should we? Yet the Democrat candidates oppose all detention of illegal aliens. They want unfettered catch and release. We have ended that program. It was not easy. We have to go through courts. Everything is a court. Everything is a suit. We do anything. We turn to the right, they sue us. We turn to the left, they sue us. We win. But we're winning. We have 218 judges now. It's good. Let me just preface that by saying I know they give fair opinions. It bears no relationship to who appoints them, but I never win with an Obama appointed judge ever. I don't win. No, we have great judges going onto the courts. Great judges. They're fair judges. They're judges that truly love our constitution. It's great. They're judges that if we feel it's right, they don't want to invite the world to trespass across our borders. Very simple. The democrat field also supports deadly sanctuary cities that release violet criminal aliens. You know that. You've been reading. All you have to do is pick up a paper every day. They release these horrible criminals to terrorize our communities. We don't do that anymore. We won't let it happen, and now we don't have to give sanctuary cities and states the money that they're going to want. It's a whole game changer.  ""I don't think he's doing a good job."" This guy doesn't know he's alive. Oh, what bad people. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75% since last spring, and we have ended catch and release permanently. You know what catching release is? We catch them, we grab them. We say, ""Could we please have your address?"" ""Address? I don't know what the hell is an address?"" They don't have an address. ""Could we have a number? Do you have a phone? Could we call your mother or your father and say in four years you have to come to court."" What they do is they catch him, they get some information that the guy has no idea where he lives, and it's one of those things in many cases, and then release. We release him into our country. We don't do that anymore. If you knew what it took … We catch them, and we take some information and we release them in, and we say, ""Please report back in four years from now for your trial."" About 2% come back, and they're the ones that are the dumbest people I've ever seen. 2%. Nobody comes back. It's crazy, but we're getting a change. It would be so easy. They call it loopholes. Loopholes. That word alone, they call it loopholes. It would be so easy if we had some democrat support. We don't have any Democrat support. They want open borders. They don't care about crime. Border Patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever in the history of our country this last year. We have deported record numbers of gang members. We are building the wall faster than ever, and we will soon be rebuilding more than one mile a day. Washington democrats have never been more extreme. 132 congressional democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders' healthcare takeover. They want to take away your healthcare. While the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and to destroy your social security. That's what's going to happen. My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan of choice. Remember when President Obama would say, ""You can keep your doctor. You could keep your plan."" 28 times. He said, ""You can keep your doctor and you can keep your plan."" Well, he lied. We should impeach him. We should impeach him for that. He lied 28 times. ""You'll keep your doctor, keep your plan. It's wonderful. Great."" Went through the roof. We're doing a great job. We killed the individual mandate, which is the most unbelievable, horrible. It's not really Obamacare anymore, but we're running the hulk of it and we're trying to kill it entirely, and then we will put it back. You'll have great health care, and preexisting conditions will be totally protected. Preexisting conditions will be totally protected. We're making healthcare better and much cheaper. While premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office, we are now offering plans already that are up to 60% less expensive than the old Obamacare. Think of that and better. And better. We are stopping surprise medical billing, a disgrace. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency, because when providers are required to show their prices, which they don't have to do, but now they do, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. They're just as good. I always like a name brand. I mean, there's something. There's no difference. Probably sometimes they're better. We've totally transformed veteran's healthcare, getting long ought VA choice and VA accountability passed after 50 years.  the spectacular right to try. You know what that is? If you're terminally ill, you go all over the world. If you have no money, you can't. You go home and you die. You're terminally ill. They go all over the world. If they have money, they go to Asia, they go to Europe. They're searching. We have the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest labs in the world, greatest technicians in the world, and we have pipelines of drugs coming out for different problems. Now, you sign a piece of paper. We're not going to hold anybody liable. You get to use that drug, and the results have been unbelievable. Unbelievable. Hopefully you don't need it, but now we have right to try. They've been trying for 51 years to get that approved. 51 years, and we got it approved. I guess I'm good at getting things approved, aren't I? Those people that I brought up here where the reason too, every one of them. They were incredible. Thank you. Thank you. Senators, Congressman, they were the reasons. We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 32 years. We have launched new initiatives combating kidney disease, which is a big deal. Kidney disease is so tough that people die literally because it's so much work. They die from overwork. It's just crazy. In theory, they could keep them going for a long time, but the work and the dialysis and all of the things they have to do. We've done things that make it so much easier, and it's just such an honor to be involved. Also, Alzheimer's disease, we're really making strides. It's really a great thing. Great thing. we're pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. Virtually every Democrat candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth. That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God. The Democrat Party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and of course the late, great Abraham Lincoln. Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are a big tent. We are a big party. We are the party of big ideas for the future. This is where it is. This is where it is. this is not the old Republican Party. This is a very inclusive party. This is a great party. Republicans are proudly fighting for nationwide school choice, including right here in South Carolina. We want to give school choice to every child in America who needs it, from kindergarten to 12th grade, because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. That's a big deal. This could not have been done by anyone but the Republican Party. They came to me, a group of people, and they wanted criminal justice reform. I wasn't sure about the issue, but we had a lot of great Republicans, very much in favor of it, including people that happen to be right here today. They were very much, and I started studying the issue, worked hard on the issue, and criminal justice reform. You saw Alice Johnson come out of prison. 22 years. She had another 20 years left. Think of it. For a phone call. For a phone call. A great woman, but we have many people coming out that shouldn't be there for anywhere near those terms. Not for those terms. But they came to see me, a group. A group of people came. Van Jones, he came up. ""Oh, thank you, sir."" They needed four senators. They needed help. I called Lindsey, I called everybody. I called Tim, who's so great on everything. I called everybody. They needed four senators and maybe five, and they needed help with some of the ones that weren't moving in the right direction. I gave it to them, and I got it, and it was not easy. We get criminal justice reform, and then I signed it. Then this Van Jones has a program that gets no ratings absolutely at all. They say, ""Van Jones wants to thank everybody for criminal justice reform."" I called our great first lady over. I said, ""Darling, please take a look. It's going to be so nice, because honestly, look, they couldn't have done even close without me."" I got all these people together, got them done. It was impossible. Previous presidents couldn't even think about it. They couldn't even think about doing it, and they tried, although I don't think they tried too hard, bur they could have never done it. So he gets up, and he starts by saying, ""I want to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton. I knew Al when he was very heavy. He looked better when he was heavy. It's true. He's one of the few people, he really looked better when he was heavy. He looked much better when he was heavy. I've got to tell him. I have to explain, because I know him very well. He would admit that he has a lot of respect for your president, but he can't admit it on television."" But he called and he said, ""I want to take the Reverend Al Sharpton,"" and then name after name after name of people that I never heard of. My wife said, ""Are they going to think about you, right? Are they going to think about you?"" I said, ""Darling, of course."" I said, ""He's saving me til the end, because I was by far."" It's true. This is true, Tim. Lindsay, this is true. I said, ""He's saving me til the end. It's going to be such an honor to be recognized, because I don't get enough publicity. I need a little bit more."" He got to the end and he didn't say it, and she looked at me. She sort of smiled. I think she loved it in a certain way. But she sort of smiled. She said, ""That's too bad."" I said, ""Yeah, it is."" Then he said, ""I have one more thing to say. We must get out this year and fight and vote against this President of the United States."" Can you believe that? It's true? It's a true story. Van Jones. These are just terrible that they could … I was a little embarrassed in front of our great first lady, but I'll live through it somehow. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years. 52 years that Golan Heights had been fighting and fighting for it. I did it, and I did the true capital, Jerusalem, right? How many presidents promise that? Every president for many, many decades promised we're going to do that. They never did it. I did it. We did a lot. We've invested more than $2 trillion in the United States military, including more than $150 million this year in Joint Base Charleston, Fort Jackson, and Paris Island. We created the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces, the Space Force. We have another branch. 72 years. Not for 72 years, the Air Force, have they done a new branch. We did the Space Force. When I first said it, everybody thought I was joking. I said, ""I'm not joking."" They thought it was from the comic strips or the future movies. I said, ""No, it's all about space."" In a number of years, people are going to say, ""I can't believe we didn't do this sooner."" We need a little vision. We need a little foresight. You know what? I mentioned Space Force. At arenas like this, it gets one of the biggest hands, because that's where it's at. That's where it's going, unfortunately, or fortunately. We needed it for defense. We needed it for offense. Sixth branch. 72 years. For years, we watched as your politicians apologize for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of South Carolina. At stake in our present battle is the actual survival of our nation. I really believe that it's the survival. You see these maniacs that we're dealing with. They want to give away everything. We will end up being Venezuela large scale version. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, to secure, then we must devote everything we have towards a victory in November of 2020, November 3rd to be exact. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the swamp. I never thought it was this deep. Man. I talked about a swamp. You never told me it was this bad, fellas. That swamp is bad. You got dirty cops at the top of the FBI. You got a lot of dirty people, but you also have phenomenal people in the FBI and other places, but we're draining that swamp. I never knew it was going to be this dirty, and we're getting a lot of help from a lot of great people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. Think of it. From poverty to prosperity. Look at some of the stories that you have over there. Look at some of the incredible stories. Look at Tim Scott. Look at that incredible story. No, really. It's an incredible story. Lindsay will say it. I give about 99% of the credit to Tim Scott's mother. I do. I guarantee you, Tim, there was no games, right? There was no games in your household. It was let's go to work, right? Great mother. Thank you very much. Thank you. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system finally of immigration. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with beautiful phrase, ""Made in the USA."" We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, infectious diseases like we're working on right now, and ending the AIDS epidemic. Nobody thought this was possible in less now than nine years, and it should have been started before. We will end the AIDS epidemic. Who would have thought we could have done that? We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have to land on moon, and then you go to Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag, and we live by the words of our national motto, ""In God we trust."" From Greenville to Columbia and from Myrtle Beach to Hilton Head to right here in Charleston, this state is home to some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth. It's true. It's true. True. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who have crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, lay down the railroads, revolutionized industry, liberated millions from poverty, hunger and disease, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. You have the best year ever on record, right? Southeast, best year you've ever had, right? You have a great governor, you have two senators, great congressman, the greatest year you've ever had, but some people in South Carolina are getting a little tired, I'm surprised to hear this, of winning. I've very surprised to hear this. Some actually called in two great senators into a big meeting, a town hall, and they said, ""Senator Scott, Senator Lindsay Graham, we're tired of winning and South Carolina. Can't do it anymore. It's too much. It's too much. We've had years where we weren't winning, and it was okay. We couldn't get jobs. We took it easy, but we just want you to go and see your friend, the president, and we want you to represent us. We want you to say, ‘Mr. President, South Carolina is tired of winning. We don't want to win anymore. We are tired, sick, tired of winning.'"" They're going to come in and say, ""Sir, I hate to tell you, but the people of South Carolina don't want to win anymore."" I'll say, ""Mr. Senators, let me tell you something. South Carolina does want to win. They want to win more than anybody, and we're not going to change a thing, because we're winning like never before. You know what? We're going to keep it that way. Sorry, senators. Go back to South Carolina, senators."" Go back to South Carolina, because we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of South Carolina, the best is yet to come. The best is yet to come. The best is yet to come, because together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, South Carolina. Thank you."
Trump,"I want to thank you very much. North Carolina, thank you very much. I'm thrilled to back in the great city of Charlotte, where, by the way, we're having our convention. I guess you heard that, right? With thousands of hardworking American patriots who love our country, cherish our values, respect our laws and always put America first. Eight months from now, we're going to defeat the radical socialists. We're going to win the great state of North Carolina in a landslide. We won it last time, we're going to win it this time by even more. And you know, Eric and Lara named their daughter, you know what her name is? Carolina, Carolina. Her name is Carolina for a reason. This is an incredible time for our nation. Our country is stronger than ever before. And today, we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history. That's great. That's great. That was great. You know, our opponents were saying, "" Oh, maybe he's in trouble, maybe the economy … "" They'll do anything. They'll do anything. I'm sure they were thrilled. Do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today? I don't think so. By the way, look at this. Look back there, look at all of that press. Look at all them. Man, I don't know if Sleepy Joe, or Bernie, I don't think they have that much press. Bernie was going wild. Why would I be here tonight? Why would I be here? He said why would I be here tonight? We don't have the primary, we've already won the thing, you know? I was going to say the you know what thing, I held it back, because they'll say, ""Horrible language. He used horrible language today."" But we're doing fantastically. There's never been a time where the Republican Party was so unified as it is now. Never, never. And you hear about enthusiasm for crazy Bernie, and that's true, he does have some enthusiasm, but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people, too. And there's not a lot of enthusiasm for Biden. I thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he's running for the Senate. I looked at the First Lady, I said, "" Hey, he's running for the Senate."" And today he just said Super Thursday, he's looking forward to Super Thursday. Jobs are booming in our country, incomes are soaring, poverty has plummeted, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the United States military. Every day, for me and for you, it's promises made, promises kept. One of the most important promises I made is right to this era. You know, we look at it, it's the never ending wars in the Middle East. We're taking our soldiers, we're bringing them back home. We're not law enforcement. We're bringing them back home. American troops cannot be the policemen for the world, or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably don't want it. The job of the American military is to secure and defend our country. Two days ago, the Unites States signed a deal with the Taliban so that after 19 years of conflict, and very close to 20, we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own American citizens And all of the things that we've done, we've wiped out the terrorists, we've done so much, and you know what? We're 8,000 miles away. You got a lot of big countries surrounding Afghanistan, you've got Afghanistan itself. The progress that was made, was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform. You know that. We pay a special tribute, and I know you pay it, a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice. As we bring back our troops, we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to America in the first place. They're not coming here, and if they do, bad things happen to them. We must keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. By the way, I have to say this, you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside. Somebody was saying that if Pocahontas, any one of them, Sleepy Joe, he doesn't have that, so he doesn't have a lot, he has very small crowds, but if Sleepy Joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size, they go around talking about how big the crowd. They never say that. Hey, take your cameras and spin them around this big arena. Right now. Spin them around. No fun to be a protestor at a Trump rally, but do we have a great time at a Trump rally? My administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect Americans from the Coronavirus. You know about this whole thing? Horrible. Including, sweeping travel restrictions. Today, we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies, and they're really working hard, and they're working smart, and we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies. They're going to have vaccines I think relatively soon. And they're going to have something that makes you better, and that's going to actually take place we think even sooner. So a lot of good things are happening, but we have strong borders, and really, our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100% right. We went out, we're doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country. We're working on that very hard. We closed our borders very early. I took a lot of heat for that. Remember when I closed the borders to certain areas of the world? I took a lot of heat. But there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection, think of it, keep all of the infection, let it come in. And we're working with other countries. In all fairness, look, it's a problem, we're working with other countries. Remember this, over the last long period of time, the flu, the common flu, you know this, right? From 27,000 to 70,000 people get infected, and many people die. Think of it, 27,000. You lose 27,000 people to the common flu. It can be much more. One year was much higher than the 70,000 number. Those people died. So when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that. I didn't know that. Three, four weeks ago, I was sitting there, I said, ""What do we lose with the regular flu?"" They said, ""About 27,000 minimum, goes up to 70, sometimes even 80, one year it went up to 100,000 people."" I said, ""Nobody told me that. Nobody knows that."" Last year was approximately 36,000 people died. So we're working hard on it, and we're going to come up with some really great solutions. In the meantime, we're stopping … Only in North Carolina. Only in North Carolina. It can only be. How many people here are from South Carolina, by the way? All right, we love both places. But that was from North Carolina. But just to finish up, so we've made a lot of progress, we've really done a great job with it. We're keeping our borders strong. My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and that's what I'll do. Washington Democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus, denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals. But honestly, not so much anymore. Everyone appreciates, these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do. We're actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very, very big problems. So we have our professionals in constant touch, I'm in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out. But the political attacks from some of the Democrats really must stop. We've got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people. We're going to safeguard our people, the United States. The United States is, right now, ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness. Earlier today, when I met with the pharmaceutical companies, things were discussed and learned honestly. The media didn't know. Nobody knew. They've never heard this before. And we learned a lot, and maybe that had the impact on the stock market. Who knows what happened, but we're going to reduce and the severity of what's happening, the duration of the virus. We discussed all of these things. We will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible. And I have to say, with a thriving economy the way it is, and the most advanced health system on earth, America is so resilient, we know what we're doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth. We have the greatest health system on earth. The renewal of American strength over the last three years means at times of challenge, we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion. No country is better equipped than America to handle new threats, and no people are more skilled, talented, tough, or driven than Americans. And together, we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That's what it is. Last month, we added 225,000 new jobs in January alone. That makes seven million jobs since the election. We have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He is dead. And we took out the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign on terror forever, Soleimani. While the extreme left has been wasting time with vile hoaxes and delusional witch hunts, we have been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, and lifting up American citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. Tomorrow, voters in states across the nation will head to the polls for Super Tuesday, not Super Thursday. No, he said, ""Super Thursday."" You can't do these things. Can you imagine if I said Super Thursday? It would be over, right? I would be over. No matter how good you are at certain things, you can't, as an example, a name like Sleepy Joe, he's constantly naming the wrong state. ""It's great to be in the state of Ohio."" No, no, no, I'm sorry, you're in North Carolina. No, no. Joe! Do you ever see them run up with a sign, ""No, no, North Carolina, Joe!"" Once that happens, you might as well leave the states, because it's a disaster no matter how good you're doing. We're in North Carolina! It's great to be in Idaho! No, you're in Iowa. Nah, he makes a lot of those mistakes, they're a little scary? We're going to protect your second amendment, you understand that. But did you see, Sleepy Joe, did you see Sleepy Joe, where he said, ""Last year, 150 million people were killed by guns in our country."" 150 million! That means 50% of our country. That's a big story. 150. Can you imagine Trump saying that? These people would never let me live it down. We can't make even a little mistake. We can't make even a little, tiny, tiny mistake. If we make a tiny mistake, it's headlining. They say things like 150 million people killed, guns, they say Super Thursday, they say Georgia, he's looking forward to winning Georgia tomorrow. Georgia's not in Super Tuesday! So many mistakes! You can't do that when you're negotiating with China. Can't do that when you're negotiating with these countries, can you? Those mistakes would be very tremendous. Then you have Mini Mike. You see this guy? Can you believe it? Mini Mike. He's being interviewed tonight on Fox. Can you believe it? Fox. They want to be politically correct. They want to interview, they end up interviewing more Democrats than Republic … I don't know what's going on with Fox. But they're interviewing this guy the night before … Mini Mike, ay, ay, ay, what a mess he is. The worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history. The worst in history. Nah, I got to have more. I'd get down real low, but I don't want to copy him. Everybody saw it. Everyone said, ""Oh,"" they all say, ""Oh! Do that again where you get down low."" But if I do that again, it's a copy. It's a copy! No, no. No. You never like to copy, even though you're copying yourself. You don't like to copy. You do it once. It was a big hit. But you do it once, and you sort of say, ""That was nice, don't do it again,"" because if it doesn't work the second time, it gets embarrassing, right? Right? We all know. But no, he's a disaster waiting to happen. He's a mess. No matter which Democrat candidate you're talking about, and you understand that, any one of these candidates … And you see what's happening, right? It's being rigged against … It's sad. It's being rigged against Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie is going to go crazy. Crazy. I think Crazy Bernie is going to be more crazy when they see what they're doing. I called it a long time ago. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Buttigieg, May Pete, he quit. Out last night. Then I hear a Senator from a state we're going to win, we're going to win that state, but she dropped out. Sounds like they made a deal. They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal. You know why? Quid pro quo, that's why. Don't care. Quid pro quo. Quid pro quo, they made a deal. Impeach them! They should be impeached! They should be impeached! Quid pro quo. But they've embraced an extreme left wing agenda. Their plans would massively raise your taxes, destroy our liberty, muzzle our faith, and erase our sovereignty. You know that. The Democrat Party has gone crazy. Whether it's Bernie Sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Pocahontas's plan … By the way, she's history. She's history. I came up with that name far too early, I should've just waited. But it didn't matter. I thought she was making a come back. I said, ""Wow, I just did it to her."" But you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago? They never caught on. In fact, she'll probably lose the State of Massachusetts to Bernie. So she doesn't know what to do because you're not supposed to lose the State of Massachusetts if you get in there. She's the Senator. She's the Senator for Massachusetts, I think she's going to lose it to Bernie. And Miss Michigan, you see what's going on over there? Michigan, we're leading. We're leading in Wisconsin. We're leading in Florida. We're leading in the last election. Hey, how great was the 2016 election? One of the greatest nights, one of the most highest rated television nights in the history of television. And remember, there was oh, this is going to be a quick one. This is going to be… oh, that wasn't so easy for them. I love the scene. The scene of that convention center where Hillary was getting ready to speak, and then she found out she lost. But Elizabeth Warren's here to plan to eliminate our borders, or Mini Mike's plan to eliminate your second amendment. Mike Bloomberg wants to eliminate your second amendment. Don't worry about it, it's not going to happen. Not going to happen for him. For sleepy Joe, he doesn't even know where he is, what he's doing, or what office he's running for. Actually, I honestly don't think he knows what office he's running for. And it doesn't matter. Maybe he gets in, because he's a little more moderate. So maybe he gets in. But he's not going to be running it. Other people are going to. They're going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country. But they're going to be super left radical crazies. They're going to be super left radical crazies, Joe's going to be in a home. He'll be watching television. Everything will be just fine. The insanity of Washington Democrats is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great Republican party. We have the enthusiasm in our party. No, I really mean it. I constantly hear about the enthusiasm. They're fighting each other, they hate each other, they don't know what's going on. We have all the love, we have all the enthusiasm, and we know what we're doing. We know what we're doing. So we're thrilled to be joined tonight by many really great, terrific, brilliant, wonderful warriors. Even though he comes from a slightly different state, but not to far by, is somebody that really has distinguished himself, he's become a great friend of mine. What he did for Justice Kavanaugh, do you remember that? One of the greatest statements ever made in the United State's Senate, Senator Lindsey Graham. Come on up, Lindsey. Lindsey Graham, come on up, Lindsey. Come here, Lindsey. I got to have him say something, come here, Lindsey, great guy. They handle pressure so well. They came and we gave a rally that was like this and Dan Bishop and Gregg Murphy won by so much, it wasn't even close. They're great people, and they've done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. They handle pressure. They were under a lot of pressure, they handled it well. It's nice to know people can handle pressure, there aren't too many of them. North Carolina Republican party chairman Michael Whatley. Thank you, Michael. I have a few great friends of mine and they love North Carolina. Louis DeJoy, who you know, Louis DeJoy. Two great people, diamond and silk. Right? Diamond and silk. We love them. You know the first lady, a long time ago now, right? How long is that? Probably almost almost five years ago, she said, ""There are these two women on the internet, they're unbelievable. They're unbelievable."" I said, ""Oh, I know, I hear that all the time. I hear it all the time."" She said, the next day she came again. She said, ""I saw them again, they're unbelievable."" I said, ""Let me see."" I saw them, I fell in love with it, and everybody fell in love with Diamond and Silk. So thank you. Some people that have really been helpful to me, Corey Lewandowski, David Bussey, and Pam Bondi, right here. Thanks also to all of the people who are working to make the 2020 Republican National Convention right here in Charlotte an outstanding success, RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel, RNC co chairman Tommy Hicks, and Convention president Marcia Lee Kelly, thank you all. You're doing a great job, I'll tell you they're looking, they're going to spend a lot of money and doing a good job. Should we doing a great job, but just an okay job? It doesn't matter as long as you win. You know what I gave when we won last time, somebody else took them to convention center, spent a fortune and I just took a hotel ballroom. I said, ""What the heck, if I win, nobody cares, if I don't."" Look if you win, nobody cares what room you're in. If you lose, nobody cares what room you're in. So we took a ballroom, nice ballroom, that's it, no big deal. I think it this way, if we win, nobody cares. And if we lose, I'm out of there, I save a hell of a lot of money. Every place that we've gone, it's been amazing. I'd also like to recognize, so important, a woman who's really helped us win North Carolina in 2016, I have a feeling this year, she'll even do better, because she happened to grow up here, Lara Trump and my son Eric Trump. Two great people. I mean I have to say that about my son, but I know a lot of people don't like their sons that much, but Lara has been fantastic, and thank you very much, what a job. She knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here. How are we doing, Lara? How are we doing? How are we doing in the state, are we doing good? And we're doing well in Pennsylvania I hear, and South Carolina, I know we're doing great there. Also with us tonight, is a man who's really become a good friend of mine. We were going at it a little bit at the beginning, but I will tell you, and I would say if I didn't get along, I would not be here. I wouldn't do this. I think he's been tremendous. He's been a tremendous supporter and things that we've wanted to do, and fights that we've had which were so important, he's been right up, and Lizzie will tell you that he's been right up in front and really he deserves another six year term. Probably a lot longer than that, but he's going to come up and I'm going to ask Senator Thom Tillis, come on up. Thom has really been incredible, he's been working everyday. And he really wants to fight to the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight, and take care of our amazing veterans, and stop illegal immigration. Thom is the champion for the people of North Carolina. This November, we need everybody to go and vote for Thom, he's doing great. He's doing great. I hear he's way up in the polls, he's way up in the polls. Thom, say a few words. ""Get me off this stage. Get me off. You guys didn't tell me this was going to happen."" No, that was great Thom. We're also honored to be joined tonight by a true American hero, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War who just turned 100 years old. His name is George Washington Perry, legit. George, thank you very much for being here. Thank you, George. 100 years. He's 100 and he looks good. Thank you, George. With the help of everyone here tonight, America has now become the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth. Since my election over 219,000 new jobs have been created right here in North Carolina. We have lifted 10,000,000 people off of welfare, including 7,000,000 people off of food stamps. Median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded, think of that. The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history, that's happening, that's happening. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history. Very important to me, African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low. African American poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded. For decades democratic politicians betrayed, and they truly did, they betrayed African Americans. My administration is delivering for African Americans like never before. No president has done more for our black community, no president has done more for our black community, and it's an honor to do it. Last month here in Charlotte, we launched a nationwide campaign to create a better future for all Americans. It's called Opportunity Now, you know about it. We're also fighting to ensure that working families have access to paid family leave, reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40,000,000 american families an average of $2,200 thanks to the Republican child tax credit. The Republicans are claiming that we did that nobody else did, but the Democrats are saying, ""How did they do that one?"". The USMCA is a giant for North Carolina's incredible farmers and factory workers. And by the way, speaking of farms, factory workers, and small businesses, are all for the death tax. You know about the death tax, right? It's called the inheritance tax. You have a small farm some place, you have a small business, you have a nice business, you no longer have an inheritance tax or a death tax. So if you want to leave it to your children, you can leave it to your children, there's no tax to be paid by your children. So they don't have to go back to the evil banker, borrow money from the banker, lose the farm, lose the business, it won't happen. And I always say, I know a lot of parents that don't love the children very much. Is there anybody in this room that does not love your children? Please raise your hand. Please raise your hand. Nobody. Nobody, that's because we're North Carolina, you love your children. But if you don't, then it doesn't matter because if you don't love your children, don't leave them a damn thing, but you don't have the inheritance tax anymore, which is great. A lot of people don't even know that, but that's a big deal or no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betraying the American people than on the issue of immigration sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities. Right here in North Carolina, believe it or not, the sanctuary county of Durham released an illegal alien criminal, who then receded to viciously murdered a young 19 year old woman last year, you know all about it. Killing her and dumping her body into the woods. Last year alone, sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina, how did that happen to North Carolina? Deliberately set free hundreds and hundreds of, and these are really dangerous criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of burglary, gun crime, sexual assault, kidnapping, and even suffering they inflict on our people. We're building the wall. We're building the wall. We're building the wall. We're building the wall. Mexico's paying for the wall, by the way. We built 127 miles as of today, 127. Mexico is paying for the wall. The media is going to be thrilled when I explain that Mexico is paying for the wall because you know, now finally they said I've had obstruction like you wouldn't believe. The entire democratic party. I could get anything. I created Space Force. I could do anything. I could get. Lindsey and Thom Tillis knows. Mark knows this. All of them knows this. If I wanted 25 cents for the wall, they didn't want to get it. They didn't want to do it, but now we got it, and you think that's easy? Nobody else could have done this. We're building it. We're building our hearts away. We'll soon be building many, many miles a week, but we're up to over 125, I guess 127, 28 by now, of the super duper wall, super duper. I went to Border Patrol, I said, "" What is your wish?"" ""Well, sir, we'd like it to be steel and concrete."" They want it exactly what they have it, and the barriers up top, they want everything. It's called a no climb provisor, no climb provisor. I said, ""What does the word provisor mean?"" They didn't know. All it means is you're not able to climb over it. It is very tough. I don't know if you saw. In a part of the wall, a couple of weeks ago, they were climbing the wall, and the fire department had to come and take them down. That's what the no climb is. That's what the no climb is. It's a no climb. It's more money. It's a little more expensive. Thank you. Who is that? What a voice. Pavarotti. So, we're building the wall. It's going great. So, they said, ""All right. He's building the wall, but Mexico's not paying for it."" Yes, they are. You'll see. You'll see. You understand. Some of you understand because I told a few people last week, it got linked to the fake news media. If you want to end sanctuary cities in North Carolina and across America, then you have only one choice. You must vote Republican. You have to. You have to. We've added catch and release, one of the worst loopholes you've ever seen, catch and release. You catch them. You then say, ""Where do you live?"" They don't know because look, let's face it, they don't know. I understand that. It's not even to be laughed at. They don't know. ""Where do you live?"" I don't know. Mexico, maybe, Honduras, Guatemala, who knows? El Salvador. ""Where do you live?"" Like this guy, he's a Mexican. You're about as Mexican as I am. Look at this guy. He's as Mexican as I am. Look at that hat. Are you Mexican? Are you Mexican? No, you're not. Are you? He is. It's like Elizabeth Warren. She said she was an Indian. I said, ""I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none. She said, ""Oh, this is terrible."" So she went out and got a test and it turned out not so good for her. Right? 1024th, right? One thousandths, so I was right. I probably have more in me. What a phony she is. What a phony. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme. 132 Congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders' healthcare takeover. While the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and your social security, and they are going to destroy your social security. Remember they used to say with me, ""I'm going to end it the first day."" Well, you know what, we're going to soon be four years and all I've done is make it stronger. You know that. My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. You're going to have great health. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember President Obama? You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. 28 times. They said, ""Impeach him. You should impeach him."" 28 times he lied. 28 times on record, ""You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan."" Well, that's not true. It wasn't. Impeach him. We're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office. We are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they're better plans. We are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will, and we are trying terminate, in the Supreme Court of the United States, the worst healthcare in the world, and we are going to give you the best healthcare you've ever seen at a low price and again, protecting preexisting conditions. Protecting preexisting conditions. We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing. You know what that is? Surprise. You get all sorts of surprises. We have people that take a blood test in one place, it's $26, and in another place it's $2000. Same blood test, maybe the cheap one is better, who knows? Same blood test. It's wrong. Surprise medical building. Bombed. Out. Billing. I signed an executive order opposing price transparency that's going to be bigger than healthcare, because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. Right? It's a big thing. It's a big thing. We've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as name brand drugs, but a fraction of the cost. We have given them, and there's a lot of political pressure not to do that, you can understand why. To care for our amazing veterans, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, and nobody said it could be done. So now, instead of waiting in line for days and days, and weeks and weeks to see a doctor, you go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get all fixed up. What a great thing. It's called VA Choice. I got it done. They've been trying to pass it for almost 50 years and they haven't been able to. Those people over there were a great help. We have passed the spectacular Right to Try. You know what that is? Hopefully nobody in the room needs. Hopefully nobody in the room needs Right to Try. We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We've launched new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer's, and we're pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients, and breaking all records in so doing. Virtually every Democratic candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the very moment of birth. How about that? That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God. Then you have the Governor of Virginia. The baby is born. The baby is born and he says, ""And then you go over and start talking to the mother as to whether or not you execute the baby."" This is the Governor of Virginia. The Governor of Virginia. He's a beauty. You remember what he did? He wanted to dance like Michael Jackson and his wife stopped him. He got lucky. But the Governor of Virginia wanted to do that. The baby is born and then he goes over and talks to the mother. The doctor will now talk, and you'll make a decision as to whether or not the baby lives. Did you ever hear of anything like this? The Democratic party is the party of high taxes, high crime, unlimited regulations, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. So many people came up to me tonight and they want me to fight, and we're doing it for school choice, so that every child who needs it, gets it. No parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Alice Johnson, do we love Alice Johnson? This could not have been done by anyone other than the Republican party. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our historic investments in the United States military include $200 million to a place that nobody's heard of in this audience, I'm sure, Fort Bragg. $300 million for Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. More than $500 million for Marine Corps Air Station New River. Listen to this one. No Democrat's going to this. They don't even want to spend money on the military. They don't like the military. They're not going to spend money. $1.2 billion for Camp Lejeune. $1.2 billion. Do you think that a guy like sleepy Joe's going to put, he doesn't know what it means. I know what I means. We have to have a strong military. We have the strongest military we've ever had. When I came in, our military was in sad shape. It was depleted, but we've rebuilt it, $2.5 trillion dollars went into our military. 01] is the actual survival of an our nation itself. If you want your children to inherit the blessings of generations of Americans who fought and died to secure, and you know what they're securing, they are securing us, they're securing our freedom, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November, November 3rd to be exact. Only this way can we save the America we love, and drain the Washington swamp, which is by the way, much more vicious, much dirtier, much deeper than I ever thought, but we are kicking ass. With your help, we will lift billions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration, and we will continue with the great Thom Tillis. We will get Thom Tillis. Thom, I don't think anybody even wants to run against you, Thom, but we're going to reelect Thom Tillis. Is that right? We're going to reelect Thom Tillis. If we don't, I'm going to be so angry at you. I'll only come back here a few times a year. No, Thom is going to be great. Thom, I think you're in great shape. I think you're in great shape. One more hand for Thom Tillis, please. We don't even know who's running against him. Nobody wants the run. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful, beautiful, beautiful phrase Made in the USA, right? Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in less than nine years. We've already started. Who would have thought? We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. Your second amendment rights are under siege. Believe me, they're under siege. We don't get in, you can forget your second amendment. That's what I think. I really believe it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that binds us together as one beautiful America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust. From Fayetteville to Wilmington, from Raleigh to Greensboro, from Asheville to Kitty Hawk, to right here in Charlotte, this state is the home to some of the toughest men and strongest women, and most incredible patriots ever to walk the face of the Earth. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, blazed the trail, sailed the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, won two world wars, defeated fascism, and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, that's what's happening. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of North Carolina, the best is yet to come. Because together, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we have made America great again. Thank you. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you."
Trump,"Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence, and hello Cincinnati. You know, I used to work in Cincinnati, a place called Swifton Village. You know what that is? Swifton Village? It was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right? Look what happened. Look what happened. I was watching the so-called debate last night, and I also watched the night before that was long, long television. The Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically. This morning, that's all the fake news was talking about. It's all they were talking about. That wasn't pretty. No, we're doing good. It's great to be back in the state that I love. I love this state. Very special. Very, very special, on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River with the hardworking patriots of the American heartland. Thank you, Ohio. We love you, Ohio. We've got thousands of people standing outside, and I asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles? Can they sit on the stairs? But I'll tell you what, this is some crowd, some turnout. We've sold tens of thousands of tickets. And, you know what the sale price is? We keep it nice and low. We keep it nice and low. But, there never has been a movement like this. This is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before, maybe anywhere, but certainly in this country. They've never seen anything like this before. You came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers, and you came for … I mean, look, from wherever you came from. There were a lot of you. And, they showed up on election day. I'll never forget, a wonderful congressman from Tennessee. They have early voting, and one of the earliest places, great state, Tennessee, and he was in Pennsylvania with me, great state. And he said, ""You know, sir, I've been doing this for a long time, but I've never seen people like this show up for early voting. People that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for."" He said, ""I've never seen it. They have Trump banners, and Trump hats, and Trump buttons. I've never seen it."" This great congressman said, ""I don't know, sir, but I can tell you one thing. If the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting, you're going to win by a lot."" And, we won, and we won by a lot. We won by a lot. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. The number one economy on earth. No economy is so strong. We're rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military, and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history, and when we took over, it was depleted. We took over a depleted military. It's not depleted anymore, I can tell you that. Our spirit is strong. Our stride is back and our stand is clear. We are finally putting America first. It's about time. We've created six million new jobs since election day. Nobody would've thought that was possible. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, and they're happy. They're happy. 123,000 more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected. Think of that number. And, right now, Ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country. Thank you. Congratulations, Ohio. Stand up, Mike. And, you have a good governor. I want to tell you that. Good job. Mike. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded. While Republicans are working every day to build up our country, the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart. The Democrat Party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear. No one has paid a higher price for the far left's destructive agenda than Americans living in our nation's inner cities. They have paid a dear price. Do you see what's happening? You see our inner cities, we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years, and it's stolen money and it's wasted money and it's a shame. For decades, these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians, and it's been total one party control of the inner cities. For a hundred years, it's been one party control and look at them. We can name one after another, but I won't do that because I don't want to be controversial. We want no controversy. No controversy. The democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay. Total decay. The Democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence. They've squeezed the blood out of them. Left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice, trapping children and failing in government schools left and right. So many of these mayors right now, you know where they are? They're in jail, that's where they are. Republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice, but the greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders. These open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals, drain public services, and flood communities with poisonous drugs. It's tough enough, and I want to thank, by the way, the country of Mexico. They've got 21,000 soldiers on the border right now. I'm starting to like Mexico a lot. They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do, right? A lot more, a lot more. And, the numbers are way down. You'll see that. Way, way down. Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents. They put foreign citizens before American citizens. We're not going to do that. 572 people were murdered in Chicago last year. So, you got a lot of hot people outside, but we broke the all time record. The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala. I believe it's higher than … Give me a place that you think is pretty bad. Give me a place. The guy says Afghanistan. I believe it's higher than Afghanistan in our country. Think of that. I believe, we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong, they will tell us tomorrow. It'll be headlines. Trump exaggerated. I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan, yet Democrats, and they've run it for many years, want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities. No good, no good. The conditions in Nancy Pelosi's once great city of San Francisco are deplorable. They're deplorable. Do you remember the word deplorable? Do you remember when Hillary used the deplorable? She used two words. She used deplorable and irredeemable, right? And only being a politician for a few years. I said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable, but it turned out to be deplorable. Deplorable was not a good day for Hillary. Crooked Hillary. She is a crooked one She's crooked. She is crooked. Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California. What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame the world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles, with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions. Look at San Francisco. Look at some of your other cities, and then you have a governor … You have a governor that invites the whole world to come into California. We'll pay for your healthcare. Then you wonder why so many people are coming up. They're coming up because we're the hottest economic country in the world, but they're also coming up because you have people like that governor say, ""Come on up. We'll give you healthcare. Come."" Who wouldn't come up? Who wouldn't come up? How crazy is this? How crazy is this? Schools, healthcare. Today, I've a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration, and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities. That's the way we should be doing it. That's what we should be doing. By the way, you know, they keep talking about, "" Oh, the voters, the voters, the voters."" They want all sorts of security. What about a thing called voter ID? Voter identification? Rob Portman, please work on that, Rob Portman. You have a great senator. Would you please start working on that? You see the response. Every place I go, Rob. Please, Rob. Voter ID. They give you everything they can give you except voter ID and the things that matter. Republicans believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first. Our pledge to America's workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 millions Americans for the jobs of tomorrow. You know who's working very hard on that? You probably never heard of her. Ivanka Trump. She's working very hard. She gave up a lot. She had a very easy life, but she loves doing it. She's got over, I think, now 12 million people. They're teaching them the great companies of our country, they're teaching people how to do it, and it's an incredible thing to watch. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could've passed except us. President Obama tried, a lot of them tried, they couldn't get it passed. I got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives, and a lot of help. And, the biggest beneficiary is the African-American community. Biggest beneficiary. And, something which a lot of people don't talk about, but we doubled the child tax credit. Doubled it. Our tax plan also created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones, hottest thing going, providing massive new incentives for investment in job creation in distressed communities. Left together, I put out a six minute video detailing everything I found unacceptable about liberalism and the Democrat Party. Take your time. Take your time. Walk away. Doctor? Doctor in the house, please? Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Don't forget, it's a hundred degrees in here. That person's been standing there for almost a day if you think about it. A lot of you, so I appreciate it. And you know what? They'll come back. They'll get a little something and they'll come right back because there's never been anything like this. There's never been anything, right? Never been. Thank you. Incredible. We established more than 300 opportunity zones in Ohio alone, and these are really working out incredibly well. Nationwide, nearly eight million African-Americans live in opportunity zones, but every democrat voted against them. Every single democrat, because they vote as a block. It's the only thing they do good. They stick together. Their policies, no good. They're lousy politicians, but they stick together like glue. It's the only thing they have. That's the only thing they have going. Democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves. Republicans deliver jobs, safety and opportunity for all Americans. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and we'll start off with a man who had a very, very tough race for governor. A lot of people choke. They choke like dogs. They can't breathe, aw. They can't breathe. This guy was running against a so-called star … So, that's two protestors, and tomorrow night the headline will be, Protesters, Protesters. You know what happened to the second one? He looked at the guy in front of him and he said, ""Ah, I'm out of here. Bye."" That's the way it works, that's the way it works, I guess. Too bad. But, a man who really has done a fantastic job, he campaigned so hard, and this was a star right from the fields of the great Pocahontas whose now lying and cheating her way to the presidency, if possible. She's trying to win, remember? She defrauded people with her credentials. She said she was Indian, and I said that I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none. I'm sorry. We drove her crazy. And, we drove her crazy. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. She went out and she had a blood test done, and it came out 1,024th. He said, "" Somewhere back there, hundreds of years ago, there may have been an Indian. Or it may have been a statistical error because it was so small."" Which, it was. Anyway, but the guy was from her group. You wouldn't be very happy right now, and we have a man that campaigned so hard, relentless. I came in, we did a rally where we had people like this. It was packed the day before the election and Mike DeWine won that election. -and Mike Dewine won that election and he won it easily. Mike Dewine. We have a man who's running for governor of Kentucky again. And he's done an incredible job. And did you ever hear, sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it? But they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct. But when you correct it, you make yourself a little bit less popular. But he had no choice and they had no choice. It's a great, great state and he has turned out to be a great, great governor. Matt Bevin. He's running in November, and because I like him so much, Matt get a nice big arena ready, we're going to do a rally for you. And a man who's fantastic son is here tonight who I just met, incredible. When I ran with him, he was down. I said, ""Rob Portman's down,"" and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points. I said, ""What the Hell did you do?"" And you know what he did? He does a great job. That's what he did. Senator Rob Portman. Great guy. And we have a few guys that, these are warriors. A couple of them you saw the other day, they were questioning Bob Mueller. That was a beauty. He was sharp, wasn't he?He was sharp as a tack and Steve Chabot and Brad Wenstrup, and Warren Davidson and Andy Barr and a man named Greg Pence who happens to be a brother of somebody I know very well. They have been with us through thick and thin, and it has been mostly really good times because what we've done, no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done. Thank you fellas. Great job. A couple of them gave a grilling. They gave a grilling. All they had to do is mention the facts and it was over. And also the auditor of the great state of Ohio, a man whose job I made much easier because you have money pouring in. You have companies pouring in. Keith Faber. How is it Keith? The numbers are good, Keith. Numbers are good, right? Yeah. The numbers are good. Ohio Senate President, Larry Obhof. Larry, thank you. Great job. Nice tie. I like Larry's tie. And you have a couple of people that are very, very powerful. I hear that office and I shudder, Ohio Supreme Court justices, Sharon Kennedy and Judy French. Thank you. Please don't recuse yourself because I gave you a nice welcome, should I ever be before you. I love judges. When they see you for about two seconds and then you say, oh, that judge should be fair. And then they say, ""I'd like to recuse myself because 29 years ago I met Donald Trump."" I'd never have been in… We've been doing very well in the courts, by the way. Have you seen? We've been winning a lot of cases, a lot of cases. We really have.  179. Percentage wise, it's the second most. We will never be number one. Sadly we'll never be number one. So percentage wise, nobody's ever seen anything like it. And that's because President Obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in, which is a shame. And I came in, I had 148 openings. You're supposed to have none. I said, ""How many do we have?"" 148. And I said, ""You got to be kidding."" And we've all done a good job together. It's been amazing, with Mitch and you and everybody. It's been amazing. So we're going to be up to, within two months, 179 federal judges. That's in two and a half years. And what else? Two great Supreme Court judges. Great ones. There's only one person. I think most of you must know this. Who percentage wise has done better than me with judges? Tell me. I'll give you a hint? He appointed 100% of the federal judges and 100% of the United States Supreme Court. George Washington. That's one record we're not going to beat. But I appointed many more than him, so let's take it that way. Many anymore. I also want to introduce a friend of mine who's done an incredible job. She's really something, she has been incredible as a leader of the GOP. She's the chair and she's my friend Jane Timken. And aman Bob Paduchik. You know Bob Paduchik? So Bob, I had to pick campaign manager in Ohio and I kept hearing from the media, ""You must win the state of Ohio."" I heard this over and over for like a year and a half. ""You must win Ohio. You must win."" So I had to pick a campaign manager and I picked a man named Bob Paduchik. And no matter what happened, no matter how badly we were doing, he said, ""Sir, you're going to win Ohio easily."" I said, ""But Bob, we just lost the head of the GOP in Ohio. He left because you have a certain governor that asked him to leave."" Great support from the governor, a different governor than Mike by the way, slightly. So he had to get out. So I said, ""We just lost."" And Bob said, ""Don't worry about it, sir. You're going to win. In fact, I think you just went up."" Then we lost a couple of other people. I'd call him. I say, ""Bob, I'm worried about Ohio. Very worried."" He said, ""Don't worry about it, sir. I think he just went up."" He kept saying, ""You just went up."" I said to somebody, ""I don't know much about this guy, but boy, he's the most optimistic person I've ever met."" True. He said, ""Don't worry."" We ended up winning Ohio by close to nine points, which is unheard of. He was right. Bob Paduchik. Bob. And also here tonight, I don't know, did he do a good job? My son, Donald Jr. and Kimberly. I hope he did a good job. Good, I heard you did. I heard you did a great job. He's been a great help. They both have. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you very much. Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker pro jobs, pro family pro growth and 100% pro American. We've eliminated a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household $3,000 more to spend every single year. The previous administration tried to shut down American energy and close up, totally, close it up. American clean, beautiful coal. That's what they did. That didn't work out too well, but you had a suffer. It didn't work out well, but get a suffer for a long time until I came along. You're not suffering any longer. The previous administration, they liked to windmills. If a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless. They make noise, they're intermittent. They kill your birds. They break down all the time. You have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out, and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy. Other than that, they're quite good. You don't want one of those windmills within vision. You hear them, they're noisy. They've got a lot of problems. No, we're going to say with the great energy that's powering our businesses, that's creating so many jobs. And solar, you know what? We'll live with solar, but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need. But we're going to stay the way we have it. We've ended the war on American energy and we're putting our coal miners back to work and our steelworkers back to work, and our auto companies back to work. We've learned over the last three years the incredible gold that were sitting on top of in this country. We're very lucky. We're now the largest energy producer in the entire world, bigger than Soviet Union, formerly. Remember the Soviet Union when it was all together. The Soviet Union, when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves Russia. When it was all together, they wanted to be, that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world. Then it became Russia and you know what? They've done a good job with energy and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy. But we're now bigger than Russia. We are now bigger than Saudi Arabia by far. I withdraw our country from the job killing and very expensive Paris Climate Accord. Last year coal export were up 92% compared to 2016. 92%, do you believe that? You're shipping it all over the world. To Vietnam. I was in Vietnam and they said, ""We get coal from Ohio. We get coal from West Virginia. It's the finest coal in the world."" We've created more than 110,000 new mining jobs, and thanks to states like Ohio the United States is now the number one producer of oil, the number one producer of natural gas, the number one everything having to do with energy. Number one. Anywhere in the world. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that led other countries to pillage our jobs, plunder our factories, and devastate Ohio communities and communities in every state. The era of economic surrender is over, and when you look at what they've done to your jobs over a period of time, NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worst deal. You still have empty buildings, empty factories, but now they're getting filled up pretty fast or being knocked down for brand new ones. We have hundreds of new companies pouring into the United States. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from one of the last administration's worst sellouts. It would have destroyed our automobile industry. It would have destroyed manufacturing in this country, and maybe that's what President Obama meant when he said, you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the United States, because he would've signed Trans Pacific Partnership and he would've been right. I killed it. And by the way, TPP, Trans Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already. Already the shipped down 30% of your jobs to Mexico. Under the new USMCA. That's Mexico and Canada. We've got to get them to vote on that because that's an incredible deal. But under the new… It's going to be very hard for companies to leave you, to fire you, to go down to make their product, whatever it may be, to send it back into the United States with no tax. All we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings. So they got to vote, on the USMCA. Before I took office, foreign countries ripped us off, robbed us blind, and pushed us around, but America is not being pushed around anymore. Do you realize that? I got that from working in Ohio for two summers. We've taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's trade abuse, and I just announced another 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese products that come into our country. And that's on top of the 25% that we take off $250 billion coming in from China, and don't let them tell you, the fact is China devalues their currency. They pour money into their system, they pour it in, and because they do that, you're not paying for those tariffs. China's paying for those tariffs. For the last 20 years, China's taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country, and now we're stopping the theft of American jobs. We're stopping the theft of so many other things happening, including intellectual property. They steal our intellectual property. I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but I'm not sure, because the word is, I feel they want to wait until they get… They're praying. They're praying. They would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the United States like they've been doing for the last 25 years. Would love to see a guy like sleepy Joe Biden who has no clue what the hell he's doing. They say to sleepy Joe. Sir, ""Just sign right there."" ""Oh, okay. I'll sign."" We'll be losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. It has to stop but they understand that. President Xi is good man. He's a friend of mine. He understands it. And until such time as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China. That's all there.  make your product in America. Come on back to the United States. Come on back to Ohio. There's no tariff. There's no tariff. Thanks to steel tariffs, hundreds of thousands of tons, think of this, were dumped on our shores, and steel is like something else. It's that quality. They were dumping garbage, they call it sand steel, they call it dirt steel.. It was mixed up. It was bad stuff and we didn't want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building. But they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel, and what was happening is United States steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and I stopped it. I put on a 25% tariff, billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back. Right here in Ohio. Nucor a great steel company, and a steel company that's doing great again, Nucor, has announced an $85 million upgrade in Marion. Charter Steel announced plans to build a new $150 million steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights, and Cleveland Cliffs announced a new $700 million plant in a very good place that I like a lot, Toledo. Toledo, Ohio. This was unthinkable because four years ago, steel plans were closing. They weren't expanding or they weren't building. We're building new plants in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, all over. Not Just Ohio. On issue after issue, Democrats have forgotten who it is that they're supposed to represent. They forgot. I wonder why they forgot. The job of elected officials is to represent American citizens, the radical Democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our streets. Sanctuary cities. Many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there, they don't want them. They don't want them. They're dangerous and not good. Here are just a few examples. In San Francisco, an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft. Yet each time San Francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free. A sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail. The very next month, the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe, a horrible thing happened. But yet again, he was released back into your community. After sanctuary city in New Jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence, he was arrested in Missouri for the murders of three people. In the bizarre worldview of the third and hard left, they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent Americans for a single politically incorrect thought. But they want to virtually, and you know this, they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder. Horrible crimes and murder. Republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. And yes just won a big lawsuit last week. In fact, on of my lawyers for winning that lawsuit is here tonight. I gave him a little reprieve. We need a lot of lawyers in the White House. We get sued so much, so unfairly, but we're winning those lawsuits left and right, but one of them is here. He said, ""I'd love to go to a rally."" I said, "" I'm going to a place called Cincinnati, Ohio. You deserve it."" We just won the lawsuit on the wall. Where's Pat? We just won the lawsuit on the wall. You hear that? We're building the wall faster and better than ever. It's time for Democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch and release. You know what you do? You catch them and then you release them and you say, ""Would you please report back in four years from now."" But only 2% come back. You know why? Because they're not the smartest. They are not the smartest. They're the ones we don't want to have come back. Only 2% show up. Catch and release, we could end it immediately if the Democrats caved. So what we're doing is something else. We're keeping them out altogether. We're replacing random migraines and we're replacing the lottery system. How about the lottery system? How about lotteries? This was chuck Schumer. You put the name in a basket. The country puts the name in a basket and you picked people out of the lottery. Well, let's see. This one's a murderer. This one robbed four banks. This one, I better not say. This one, another murder. Ladies and gentlemen, another murderer. Think of this. Do you think they're going to put great citizens… they have great citizens, they have great people like we have great people. Do you think those people are going into a lottery? No. And then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country. The country isn't based on that, the country, you just take a look, look at the people they put into these lotteries. It's a disgrace. And how we've done this for so many years folks, how we've done this. It's an immigration system that's totally broken and we're going to win the House, we're going to win the Senate, we're going to win the presidency and we're going to do a merit based immigration system. Merit based. Merit based immigration. And we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers. We need good people. We're down to 3.5% unemployment. We need people, but we want people to come in based on merit, not based on some lottery put in by a governor. Democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private- Dream. Liberal politicians want to eliminate private healthcare and force everyone onto the government plan. Remember the lies from the previous administration. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. 28 time, one lie after another. 28 times it was said and it turned out to be a total lie. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you. We're offering right now plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. Always. Always. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. And then you'll have like a governor of Virginia, it's not only late term abortion, it's killing the baby after the baby is born. How about that? Think of that. Think of that. That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and they're the party, frankly, of socialism. The Republican Party is the party of freedom. We're the party of the American worker, the American family. We're the party of the American dream. I'm fighting for you each and every day. I had a great life. I used to get great publicity. Nobody got better… I had such a great life. It was so easy. My great wife, the first lady, Melania, she said, ""You know, you've always been a hard worker. You love to work, but your life was a lot easier in the old days."" But I love it and you know why I love it? Because we're accomplishing so much. Nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things we're doing. Even a thing like Right to Try, right? Right to Try. They've been trying to get that for years and years and years. That's people that are really sick, terminally ill. They couldn't get medicine. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest clinics, the greatest technicians in the world. They couldn't get anything. They'd traveled to Asia if they had money. They traveled to Europe. They'd travel all over the world hoping for a cure. If they had no money they'd just go home. They'd die. They had no hope. For 44 years, they've been trying to get Right to Try. We are so advanced in medicine. We have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work, but we weren't allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick. You know why? Because they didn't want this drug if it didn't work to hurt the people, but the people were terminally ill. So I got it approved and it wasn't easy. It was complicated. The insurance companies didn't want to do it. The government didn't want to do it. The doctors didn't want to do it. Tremendous liability. But our country didn't want to do it. They said, ""Well, if it doesn't work, we're going to get sued."" I say, ""So they'll sign an agreement, very strong, one page, taking all liability away from the United States, from the drug companies, from the doctors, all liability. They're terminally ill. Let's try it."" And you know what? It's been a miracle. So many people have done so well. It's great. We got it done. When I set about the agreement, they had these great lawyers and they said, ""Gee, that's a good idea."" They'd been working in this few years. They said, ""That's a good idea."" I said, ""Yeah, it's a good idea. How about getting you to me like in about two hours?"" Right to Try. It's a great thing. But we have so many things like that. I have lists that you wouldn't even believe. I have lists that go on for pages of things we've done. We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, including a plan to allow companies to import lower cost drugs from other countries. It's a very unfair system. Our country pays the highest prices in the world. Last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down. Now we're going to bring it down by a lot. We're going to bring it down a lot. And now… So other countries… Here's an example, Canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do. So we have a great governor in the state of Florida, Ron DeSantis, calls me up. Doing a great job. Ron DeSantis. He was at three and he went to 70. that's a pretty good increase, right? Ron DeSantis, a great governor. And he comes to me, he goes, ""You know, if you buy the drugs, if we buy the drugs, because this is so botched up, we have a middleman. It's not a good situation."" He said, ""If I could go and buy the drugs from Canada, I could save 50%."" I said, ""Do it. Do it. And if you can buy them from Europe, because their system…"" Like, remember I used to scream when I was winning states and not getting the delegates that I was entitled to and I'd say the system is rigged? Well, the drug system is rigged. It's rigged. So if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from Europe or from Canada or from other places at a big deep discount, we're doing it and we're giving them the right to do it. Just happened today. And we're doing one other thing that, believe it or not is even bigger, but you'll be seeing that over the next two weeks. With the help of your great Senator, Rob Portman, we've taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in Ohio, drug overdose deaths went down 22% last year, 22%. No, but think of that. Opioid, big problem, big problem. Deaths went down. Opioid deaths, 22%. Nobody writes that. Nobody talks about that. They don't want to talk about that. Good job, Rob. Good job. Good job, Mike. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. They been trying to pass VA Choice for four decades. They couldn't get it done. We got it done. We got it done. This is where a veteran would stand online for three, four, five, six days, for three weeks, for five weeks. Sometimes they're okay. By the time they see a doctor, they're terminally ill. And I said, ""You know, I have a great idea."" Because I not been doing that this long. You know, we've been working with this for… I've been thinking about it a lot. This was during the campaign. What a campaign that was, right? Was that a campaign or what? And I came back to my people. I had experts and I said, ""I have a great idea. These lines for the veterans are too long. It takes them three, four weeks sometimes to see a doctor. I have a great idea. Let's let them go outside. Go to a private doctor. We'll pay the bill. They'll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately. We'll pay the bill."" And I thought… I said, ""Man, am I smart? I am the smartest guy to think of that."" So I went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and I said, ""How do you like that idea?"" And they said, ""Sir, we've known about it for about 40 years, but we've never been…"" I said, ""Really? You've known about it that long?"" But here's the thing. We got it done. Nobody else could get it done. Nobody else. And Accountability. You couldn't fire anybody. If they were treating our vets badly, you couldn't fire them for anything. People could steal. They could be sadistic to our vets. By the way, they wouldn't have done that in primetime to our vets. I can tell you that. They can be whatever they want. You couldn't fire them. And it was because of unions and it was because of other things. Civil Service. Very tough. You couldn't fire anybody for almost anything. We had cases where people got… They got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldn't fire them. We got VA Accountability. Now we say, ""Jim, get the hell out of here. You're fired."" We're rebuilding our military. And after years of budget cuts and layoffs, the army tank plant in… Do you Lima? You call it Lima, right? See? You know, most people call it Lima, but I know Lima. But you know why? Because I came here and they said, ""We're closing this plant."" I said, ""What kind of a plant is it?"" Remember when I was here? In Lima. And I used to say, ""You mean Lima?"" They said, ""No, sir. It's Lima."" That's why… Because, but Leah, hey look, I'll be honest with you because they have it wrong with the teleprompter, okay? And I would have been in big trouble. But the good news is I don't use the teleprompter too much. If I did, you would've been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal. But in Lima, and I said, ""What kind of a plant?"" And I said, ""Let's go see it."" During the campaign I went to see it and they make the incredible, the best army tank in the world and I couldn't believe the complexity, the genius. I said, ""Wait a minute. You close this, you'll never be able to open it again. You can't open this. This isn't like a normal situation that you can open four walls and a roof. This is complicated. This is genius and you'll never replace these men and women that work here."" I said… And I didn't know anything at the time other than I said, ""You're not closing it."" They took it off to list. They kept it open and now we're making army tanks around the clock. We're investing in the future of human space flight. Americans won the race to the moon and we will now win the race to Mars. It's going to be amazing. And you know, one thing I have to say also, and we're also winning the race to great, great strategic defense and offense, not just Mars. And Mike Pence is doing a great job on that. Great job. To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, a horrible, stupid deal. We gave Iran $150 billion. We gave Iran $ 1.8 billion in cash. Plane loads of cash. I wonder what they saw when those planes landed. I wonder what happened to the cash? Can you believe it? One $1.8 billion we gave them in cash. And remember what I said, Iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago. When I took over, Iran was all over. They had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction. They were all over. And now they just want to… They want a negotiated deal so badly. Iran. Iran. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just a few months ago, we recognized the Golan Heights. You know that. That's another one. Big one for the security of Israel. Also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuelan and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place. Let's see what happens there. Let's see what happens. Tonight we renew our resolves that America will never be a socialist country. Never, ever, ever will it be a socialist country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great, our beautiful, our wonderful American dream. We're not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism. You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing. It's about you. I say it again. I say it all the time. Never happened before. There's never been a movement like this. They've had movements. They never went… They won a state. They did well in the state. We won 32 states. There's never been anything like it. There's never been anything like it. But this movement is about your family and your future, and it's about the life and the fate of your country. We begin our… Hey, look, this is a good place. Is this a great thing to do? We begin our campaign and we're going to do great, Bob. Right, Bob? Bob, if we don't do great, you're fired, Bob. You're fired. But think of it, our Ohio campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nation's future. And again, remember this, Ohio is doing better today than it's ever, ever, ever done before. It's the best it's ever done. What's going to do… A guy like a sleepy Joe Biden is going to come in and say, ""But I could do better. I could do better."" He wants to go back to sleep. Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can reach their fullest and highest potential, tremendous potential. Our country has such tremendous potential. You know, we've had… The last week, we've had the highest stock market in the history of our country. That means 401ks. That means job. But there's tremendous potential to go up. We have tremendous potential to go up. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words ""Made in the USA"" or ""Made in America"". Either one. You can use either one. Made in America, made in the US. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine and I see what they're doing. I see it. They show me the things we're doing in our country today. There's never been anything like it. We will be ending the AIDS epidemic shortly in America and curing childhood cancer very shortly. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Just remember with the Democrats, there is no second amendment. You can forget about keep and bear arms. You can forget it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We will never ever stop fighting. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the sanctity of life. And we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always be proud, patriotic Americans. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, ""In God We trust."" Two days ago, I spoke at the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislature assembly at Jamestown, Virginia. It was beautiful. It was incredible. I was… I must tell you, I was reminded of so many great things in our country. We have been blessed with such a remarkable and priceless heritage. We are the greatest republic on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way. Every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. The future belongs to the greatest movement in the history of our country. And with your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one people in one family saluting one great American flag. We all share the same home. We all share the same heart. And we all share the same love of Almighty God. Together, with the great and proud people of Ohio, we are making America wealthy again. We are making America strong again. We are making America safe again. We are making America great again and with your vote in 2020 we will keep America great. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you."
Trump,"Hello Colorado. We love Colorado, most beautiful place And I'm thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs. I've spent a lot of time here over the years. Beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, that's true, of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great American patriots. With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide. And you're going to help us get Cory Gardner across that line because he's been with us 100%. there was no waiver. He's been with us. There was no waiver with Corey. We appreciate it. Thank you Corey. Thank you. This month we mark a very special anniversary. 75 years ago this week our brave United States Marines landed on the shores of Iwo Jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war. It was a rough one. Tonight it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the Battle of Iwo Jima, James Blaine, Donald Whipple and John Thurman. Great, great patriots, very brave people. Just passed away. Sadly he passed away just a few days ago. He was going to be here. Passed away a few days ago, but he was great. I have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we're going to honor him and his family. Great, great gentlemen. So we were going to have four. We have three and we want to thank you for being here. Thank you all. Thank you. Because America is truly a land of heroes, on behalf of the grateful nation I would like to recognize the many veterans of the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who are here this evening, and a lot of them. Great people, great people. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country. We are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close. And we've rebuilt our military over the last three years. Don't tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we don't worry about budgets, right? We don't worry about budgets. We had to rebuild it. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. It was old, it was tired. We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment. Now we have brand new jets. We have brand new missiles and rockets. We have everything all made in the USA. In my State of the Union Address, I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That's what we're doing. Our country is stronger today than ever before. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades, the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had today, just came out. And I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate, it got very big ratings and you know what? Mini Mike didn't do well last night. I was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what I do, is it? It's not easy, Mike. Not easy for any of them. Now, Mike didn't do too well. He went way down. It's all right. Mini mike. How about Klobuchar, did you see her? She choked. She choked. She couldn't breathe. Alfred E. Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, ""Are you accusing me of being dumb?"" Who would make a statement like that? Because that's really what he was doing, but he doesn't want to say that. No, how about that? ""Are you saying I'm dumb?"" That was the end of her campaign in my book. You don't say that. Even if it's true, you don't say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you, Fox doesn't treat us the way they used to. But we have the great Sean Hannity, we do, and we have Laura and Tucker. And we have in the morning Fox and Friends, Steve and Ainsley, and Brian's gotten much better, he's moving up. And we have the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs says he's the greatest president ever. The great Lou Dobbs. He says, Lou Dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, ""He's the greatest since Reagan."" Then he said about six months ago, ""He's better than Reagan."" And then he said a few nights ago, ""He's the greatest we've ever had."" I said, ""Does that include Lincoln and George Washington?"" He said, ""That includes them all."" That's Lou Dobbs. The great Lou Dobbs. And you've got Hegseth and you've got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse? And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us, right? But now he says, ""Look, whether I like him or not, he gets it done. It's all about getting it done."" We're getting it done. Nobody's ever done what we've done. No, but Fox says, and I don't know, it's different. It was different. In the old days, it was better for us. It was better for us. But it's okay, we'll win anyway. No, but they had this woman on. Neil Cavuto, doesn't treat us good. Neil Cavuto, he's not too good. She said, ""I don't like him."" Nobody likes him. Right now… So you had, remember Lest in The Readies? You remember who was Lest in The Readies? He got fired, right? You remember, right? Remember? He's gone and now Neil's taking his place. Neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesn't like Trump too much. And he put this woman on today and she said, ""Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates and he won,"" because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike. And I said, ""Wait a minute, I won every debate."" It's true. And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll. Not only won them, but won by a lot. I won every debate. I'm just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine. I said, ""Nobody's allowed to do that. You can't do that."" We're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news. They make up 90% of the story. So where is Dan Scavino? Where is Scavino? Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is? Dan, bring me those pages up here. Bring those pages up. See if you can get them. Go get them. It's such fake news. It's so disgusting. You know what? They'd do better if they told the truth. Do you agree? They'd do better. Oh, someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when I'm gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, they're going to miss us. I told the story that a month before I ran, 2016 I was thinking about it. I said to my wife, who has become a great First Lady. People love here. They said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled. And I said, ""What the hell should I run for if they are so great?"" But I remember holding up the New York Times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain, a supermarket, right? It's like, the thing was blowing in the wind. It was dead and now it's successful again. But when we leave, it's all of us. We leave together. We're unified. This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been. And when we leave, the New York Times… Thank you. The great Dan Scavino, the most powerful man in politics. Hey Dan. So Zuckerberg left. Who is number one in the world on Facebook? And I'm saying this in front of the fake news because if I'm wrong, they're going to report me, right? Who is number one in the world on Facebook? He walked in, but that's us. He walked in for… We had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes. I want to find out what's going on. But he walked in, he's smart, and he said, ""I just want to congratulate you."" Small dinner, a few people. He said, ""You're number one in the world in Facebook."" I said, ""That's nice."" I said, ""Who's number two?"" He said, ""Prime minister Modi of India."" I said, ""Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one."" But we're never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, for anything, and they still haven't figured it out. They have not figured it out. But look at all that press. Look at all that press. Did this ever happen before? And then you have Brad Pitt. I was never a big fan of his. He got upset. A little wise guy statement. A little wise guy. He's a little wise guy. Anyway, but we're doing what? Over here, I just showed this real quick. Right? So this horrible journalist, she's a real, she's a Trump hater. You know what she's worth? Zero ratings. Nobody watches her, but she said… she was trying to… Look, Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked. He's another one who's going, "" Oh I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Don't ask me the question, please."" I look at my wife, I said, ""Let's send him a little note. It's not so easy up there to do what I did, right?"" Not so easy. But this woman who is a third rate, fourth rate, she's been with everybody. Every year she's with a different group, but I won't use her name because it'll make her too famous. It actually plays to their advantage. But she's third rate and she's on the lowest rated show at Fox, Neil Cavuto. That's why. So she said, ""Donald Trump didn't get good ratings. He didn't do well in the polls."" She said, ""He didn't do well on the debates."" She said that we were defeated in the debates. Well I defeated crooked Hillary every time and by a lot. Yeah, she's crooked as a $3 bill. I was going, ""Whatever happened to the 33,000 emails? Whatever happened?"" 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn't get in trouble. Can you imagine if a Republican did that? They would want to bring back the death penalty, right? Two standards. But I think things are happening. I said drain the swamp, I just never knew how deep it was. We have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe. And this is part of the swamp. So what happens? She said, ""Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates."" Now remember my answer, Rosie O'Donnell, right? First question I've ever, and we took down the house. Then the second, Brett Barry asked me, I had to raise the hand. I'm the only one, I guess that raised the hand. Right? And the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth. Okay? Turns out I was the only one telling… And the people get it. But she said I didn't do well on the bench. I said, ""Really? I won every single debate."" We had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself. So here's one. I don't want to… I'm a little guilty because these are all my friends, right? A lot of them are my friends now. They weren't my friends then, they were my mortal enemy. It's hard to be friends when you're competing against somebody. You're right about that. So here's Donald Trump, 67. The next one was 13%. the next one was 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 1%, 1%, and 0. All right, that's Time Magazine. All right, that's Time. They don't like me. I don't like them either, by the way. Although actually I do like the new owner. This year I got beaten out by Gretta. You know Gretta? Last year I got beaten out… I mean, I've won it. But when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen. There's nothing wrong with it, right? I mean, we've won it, but we should win it every single year, let's face it. And now they call it person of the year. They don't go out man of the year. And I know the women out there are saying, ""Isn't that nice?"" But a lot of the women out there don't like it. They don't like it. We could have a woman of the year and a man of the year. I like that. Okay, here's Drudge Report. Drudge is starting to treat me good again. He started to like me again. I like him. Look, Trump and Ted Cruz, I can say he came in second. He was a great debater. And Marco came in third and a guy who I don't like much and they don't like him much in Ohio either, Kasich. Kasich. He was way down. Way down. Okay, look who won? Trump. Here's another one. Look again, a different one, Time Magazine. Trump, 33%. Ben Carson, good man, he was down. Marco, Jed, Ted. Carly Fiorina, a name I haven't heard in a long time. What happened to Carly? And ran, good poll. Here's the story. Look, but way up. Way up. Look at this. Here's another one. Look at this. Trump 46%. I didn't make this up. Here's another one. This is a different debate. I don't know. They're all different. I won every one of them. Look, Trump, I just took these at random, 46%. second, 5%, 3%, 5%, 3%, 9%, 5%, 11%. Trump, 46%. Here's another one, CNBC. Well, the market's been up. They've actually been not so bad and Joe Kiernan is a good guy. He is a good guy. Some of the rest, I don't care for it too much. Becky's like, she plays it a little bit down in the middle, right? Which is okay. Trump, almost 50%. Then they have all the rest of them. 14, 4, 3, 2, 2.8, 2.54, 1.9, I'm not going to give you the names. I won't tell you that I got 48.8 and Jeb Bush got 1.1. The rest I'm not going to talk about, but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter, sort of a never Trumper I guess. So Jeb, 1.9, 1.1, and Trump 48. That's another one. Oh, here's a nice one. Here's a nice one. Look at this. Look at this. Trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Trump didn't do well in the debate. See, they're fake news. Here's another one, Trump Kicked Ass. Trump Kicked Ass. Trump 48, number two was six. Here's another one. Trump 75.6, crooked Hillary was 24%. This was against crooked Hillary. So look at that. Trump was 74.6, crooked Hillary Clinton was 24.1. Trump was 80%, crooked Hillary was 18%. And I've got this woman. You know who it is, right? Nobody knows the name. I'm not going to mention it. But everybody knows Neil Cavuto. She has no credibility and neither do you, Neil Cavuto. Here's another one. Crooked Hillary, and by the way, one is a Fox poll, one is Breitbart, one is a Drudge report. One is a Patch, one is Syracuse.com, one is Pollack Opinion, Alyssa Goodwin. But look at these numbers. Trump 92. What is it? So I'm winning every poll, I beat crooked Hillary. Here's the one, Trump 61, crooked Hillary 39. Okay? That's what it is. And then I turn on the damn show on Fox. Again, it's not the same. It was much better. It really was. It was much better. I turn on Fox and I've got this third rate political journalist, if you call her that saying, ""Trump did very poorly in the debates, but he became president."" No, I did great in the debates. I became president because of the debates, because unlike Mini Mike, I could answer questions. And here's the final one and I could get you another 15. These are all the ones that taken right after. People call in, hundreds of thousands of people, they call in Time Magazine, CNBC. So here's a CNBC, crooked Hillary Clinton, 39%. Donald Trump, 61%. and then this stupid person said I didn't debate well. Now look, I don't mind and you can have bad debates, but I won every single debate. Listened to this, then three and a half, four years later I have to listen to a person saying how we didn't do well, because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world. Take it. Take it. Here it is. Okay, let's get back to business. Now I feel good. Now I feel good. She's a third rate journalist. Let's go. We're standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right? While the extreme left has been wasting America's time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes, we went through hoaxes. We went through the impeachment scam. And by the way, Corey was with us all the way. He didn't move. He didn't budge. He said it's a lot of bull. He said it's a lot of bull. But while they're doing that stuff and we're working with a cloud, we're working with these people. They want to take you out. They want to change the results. They got caught spying, let's say it like it is, right? They got caught spying on our election. Fake news. Hey fake news, take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you. Go ahead, show them the room. Show them the room. You see, they never do it, including Fox, by the way. Fox is not that much better. We just got lucky because we have some… All their high rated shows are the shows that like Trump, all their losers shows like Cavuto are the shows that don't like Trump. How is Shep Smith doing lately, by the way? How is Shep Smith? He had the lowest ratings and now Cavuto took his place so that's okay. But they never show the room. My wife, a great First Lady, she goes… I say, ""Hi honey. Did you watch the debate?"" ""Yeah."" ""How did the room look? Was that…"" because last night I think we turned away 21,000 people. We had an arena that it held 12, but we fill up the basketball courts, right? Or the ice rink. We had to have 15, 16,000 people. It was on fire. You all saw it. It was great. And she said to me, she said, ""Darling, how did you do?"" I said, ""I did great."" I said, ""Did you see the arena?"" And she said, ""No, they never show the arena."" You know that guy Dana White at UFC? I won't tell you about him yet, but he's a brilliant guy, right? I mean, he sold his crazy fighters, I mean bomb bomb bomb. $4 billion he got with Fertittas, great people. But you know what? They're always showing it's full. It's full. These fakers back there, they don't want people. But I'll tell you what my wife said, ""They don't show it, but you can't imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the noise."" Look, they won't show it. They never show it and we've never had an empty seat from the day I came down the escalator, not one. What these guys do if Mr. And Mrs. Jones sitting right up there, beautiful couple. If she said, ""Darling, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it, darling. I have to go to the bathroom."" He said, ""Darling, I'll walk with you."" The cameras glong on to those seats, they glong on and they say, ""There were two empty seats. Trump didn't fill up the room."" These are the worst people. But when I told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way. Now, if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where it's loaded up with people, those cameras that can do, they look like a pretzel. They look like a pretzel. They want to find it. There's trouble, those same guys could, it could cover anything. I used to think, well it's the equipment, it's very rigid. They can't turn it. And then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because that's dangerous in this room, to be honest. We don't have it too much. They only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren't fighters. But if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel. They bend, boom, they get. So that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment. And by the way, I told them, turn around, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it's fake news. While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with vial hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right? We added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month, way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be, 225,000. Think of it, we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 billion. 00 in the morning, they are watching. The whole world was watching. That was the most exciting television that anybody's ever seen. Even ESPN, some guy on ESPN said, ""This is the most exciting event I've ever seen."" And all he does is watch sporting events and big ones. But since the election, 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we've invested more than $2 trillion into that military that we talked about. And we created- Into that military that we talked about, and we created something that's very exciting. And we have our great new General. He's on the … he's on our … I'll tell you, he was on a list of the most incredible men you've ever seen. The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force. And I will be making a big decision for the Space Force as to where it's going to be located, and I know you want it. We'll be making that decision toward the end of the year. I was here, I did your … I met … I was up at the Air Force Academy, and I greeted those kids, they were so great. I did the commencement address. Was anybody there? I did the commencement address. And the General said, sir, would you like to shake hands with the cadets? I said, does everyone else do it, President? Oh, yes, sir. What he didn't say is, they'll shake 10 hands. I said, so they do … how many do you have? Sir, we have 1156 cadets. I said, you mean other people do it? Yes, sir. But they don't do 1156. They'll do 30, 40. They'll take the top 10 out of the class. I said, I'll do it. I stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing. True. And I shook 1156 hands. And a lot of these kids are very strong physically. In fact, you have one of them as an example, he was the winner of the home run derby. Did you know that? College … think of that. The college home run derby. I said, let me see you. I want to see what you look like. He stands up, uniform, everything else. And by the way, I did something for Air Force, but I did something for all of the academies. If you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting, although they've done well, if you're a great athlete, you can't … we wanted to get them to go, but they didn't because they didn't want to serve five years in the military and then they'd go into the NFL or baseball. So, I had one of the teams in. They said, sir, give us the waiver, sir. They've been after the waiver. You know what the waiver is? That means that if you're a great athlete, you can go to the Air Force Academy, or Army, Navy, the Coast Guard, you can go to one of our service academies. I did the rule and we got it through Congress. And you don't have to serve. You go directly into the major leagues and to the NFL, and you serve your time after, when you get out. Isn't that great? And the Army coach, who's a great guy … all great guys. Navy coach, Army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just can't do that. Now they serve their time afterwards. Isn't that great? And we did it. They've been trying to get that for so many years. But I love that group of people. I saw this guy from the home run derby, and I shook hands. Oh, I shook hands. And they come up and they're strong people. And they're shaking, and they're excited. They're a little nervous, maybe. They're meeting the President. They're a little nervous, and they're strong. They've got big, strong hands, and they're saying … and I'm saying, hello. Sir, thank you. Man. Jeez. What are you? I'm captain of my wrestling team, sir. I admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir. It's like … and I'm trying to act like it doesn't hurt. By the end of the day, I'm going like … but we did it. And then I said, wait a minute. I said, General, no other President could do that. The Presidents don't do that. He said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50. Oh, that's great. But I love the Air Force Academy. And you have all of the infrastructure, so you're being very strongly considered for the Space Command. Very strongly. And actually, I have to say this. I think I can say this, Mr. Senator, but the Governor showed up at the plane today, your Governor. Democrat. No, but in all fairness, he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it. That's okay, that's all right. And we are going to be making that decision, Cory, when we make that decision, all right? Okay. But we've destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate 100 percent. We killed the founded and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He's dead. He's dead. And we just killed the world's number one terrorist, Qasen Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. Forever and ever. He was the king of the roadside bomb, right? When you see these young men and in some cases women, no legs, no arms. They get it, and 92 percent of them were from Soleimani, and then they started making them … they had great detection. We had these guys, great detection, then all of a sudden, the detection wasn't working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal. So they're blowing the guys up with the scopes, so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic. Real scum, but he's gone, he's evil, he's dead, and America is respected again like never before. But as we keep on winning, Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They've gone nuts. That's why millions of registered Democrats, voters, people that were with the Democrats for a long time, they're leaving their party to join our movement. They're joining our great Republican party. We have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years. And don't believe stories, and don't believe polls, because the polls are worse than the stories. They give phony polls. 00. The polls have closed … and you know they only announce if you're very … if you're really going to win by a lot. Otherwise, it takes all night. The polls have closed in the great state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas. Thank you. But they had Alfred E. Newman, Buttigieg, little Buttigieg. I said, I've had you up to here. They had little Buttigieg leading Donald Trump in Texas. These people. But very close. They said, it's too close to call, where Buttigieg … so, a friend of mine from Texas, a big, powerful, strong guy, real Texas, he's got the cowboy hat … I'd love to wear that hat, I wouldn't have to comb my hair so much. I wouldn't need hairspray, right? I love those Texas hats. I don't know if we'd get away with it in Washington, that's my only problem, but I love them. This guy wears that big hat, the biggest hat. He's a big guy. And he's interviewed by somebody. He said, listen, I don't know much about politics, but I can tell you one thing. Buttigieg is not tied with the President. The President is leading him by 20 points. It's like I said the last time, nobody's leading Trump in Texas. And you know what? Nobody is even close to us in the great state of Colorado. We're leading big. Nobody. With your energy and enthusiasm, this November, and specifically it's November 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big … and I can't say bigger, because what was bigger than that? They came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place. Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. Women would come in, they hadn't voted in 20 years, great women, beautiful women, strong women, smart women, wives. No, no, incredible. And they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and they're … we're the elite, just so you … they're not the elite, we're the elite. And you know what? They'd show up, they've got Trump bandanas along with our great Vice President Mike Pence, Trump Pence, and they got the hats now and they walk … these are people that were never political people. They never wore a pin. Now they've got 30 pins all over their chest, they've got the hats with the things and the Trump, and nobody's ever seen anything like it. Really, it's a great revolution, and we're turning this country around. And I'm not saying anything can ever compete with 2016, but I think if we don't do it, a lot of what we've done, and we're going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we've done for the vets with choice and accountability, but you know what? They can undo it, but in four years they can't undo it, because that tree will be planted. It will be solid. They're not going to be able to do it, so we've got to win. And your second amendment is at stake, remember that. So this November, we're going to take back the House, we're going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we're thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country, and I want to thank Mike Pence. I heard he gave a great speech. I never want it to be too good. I never want it to be too good. I said, Mike, take it easy. Can't be too got. Mike is great. But we have Secretary David Bernhardt, Department of Interior. Thank you. Come on up, Dave. He's great. What he's doing, by the way, he's the largest landlord by a factor of about 2000. Department of the Interior. You're taking good care of Colorado, please? Okay. He's a big deal in Colorado, right? He's a big deal. All those beautiful mountains and rivers and lakes, he's the guy. You better keep them nice and clean. Believe me, we like the environment more than anybody. We want clean water and we want clean air. And you have warriors. You have guys, they fought for us. 197 to nothing. We were … when you think of it, the Republicans, 197 on the house to nothing. Congressman Ken Buck, come on up. Congressman Scott Tipton. And Congressman Doug Lamborn. Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And we're also joined tonight by somebody that you really love, and I love him, too, but there's a reason. He's my son. Don junior. And Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly, thank you, Kimberly. And a man … he happens to own the Chicago Cubs, but that's okay. He's done an incredible job, actually. He had a five year plan on the fifth year, the stadium was fully rebuilt, and they won the World Series. That's not bad. He had a five year plan. RNC finance chairman Todd Ricketts. Come on up, Todd. Come on up. Come on up, Todd. And I mentioned him a little earlier, but you didn't know he was here. I just said he's a champion, he's a winner. He's been a friend of mine for a long time. He's a tough cookie. He's the kind of people that made our country great. Truly, they've made our country great. He started off with two people fighting each other, then he got four people fighting each other, then he got them fighting each other, each other. Then he got six and eight and 12. All of a sudden people started watching and looking, and I was proud to hold his first event. That's why he loves me. They didn't want … they said, it's too dangerous. Nobody would take it. I'm the only who said, take it. We'll take it. And it was unbelievable. I went and I said, this is great. Let's do it again. And he has been my friend for a long time. And they put together a phenomenal deal, it's called UFC. He's the UFC president. And they just sold the company. He started it off for about $ 30, and they just sold it for $4 billion. And the people that bought it said, we're not buying it unless Dana White stays back and runs it. So Dana White, come on up. He's now a very wealthy guy. Come here. You want to hear from him? Yes. What's up, Colorado? How are you today? So, I'm not a very political person, I'll start there, but let me say this. There's things that I can tell you about the President of the United States that you don't hear on t.v. and you don't hear from other people. Like you said, I've known this man for 20 years. We've actually become even closer since he's become the President of the United States. When somebody becomes the President of the United States, you don't ever expect to hear from them again, and I understand it. It absolutely makes sense. This guy is so loyal and such a good friend, every time I see him … I saw him today. When I met him on Air Force One, the first thing he said to me is, how is your family? How is your family? Good man, very loyal, and a very good friend. I see a lot of things from Mr. Trump that the public doesn't see, and the people who surround me every day see how this man treats me as a friend, and other people he's friends with. He's a fighter, he loves this country, he's doing great things for this country, and we got to win this election again, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. That was beautiful, because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time. Right, politicians? What a job he does, and we thank you very much, Dana, and you are my great friend, and thank you. But with Cory and with me, they're not going to play with your second amendment. Not going to happen, but it's … it is under siege. You see what's happening. But somebody … we fight together, and he's been so great. Cory Gardner, please come on up, please. Thank you. That's beautiful. That's true of the pipeline. A long time they've been trying. We got it right away, and we'll be announcing something very big toward the end of the year. Cory is a champion for the people of Colorado. He loves your state. Look, he loves your state. He was here, he does the tractor thing. He loves tractors, he sells a certain type. And don't worry, if there's any noise, just let them … they won't hear us. And he's got my complete and total support and endorsement. He will never let you down. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded. And for women, 71 years, and soon you're going to be hitting the historic number. 71 years, the best numbers in 71 years. African-American and Hispanic-American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women is going … and I'm telling you, within a very short period of time, you're going to see some statistics coming out on … statistics. I've got to do it right, otherwise they'll say, what's wrong? If you go 16 of these, and if you mispronounce one word, they say, what's wrong? Statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable. They're going to be unbelievable. The best ever. The veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in U.S. history. Half a million more Hispanic-Americans now own a home. We've lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country. Think of that. Think of this. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with Tim Scott great guy, great Senator from South Carolina, opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in Colorado. You know about that, right? It's been amazing. Opportunity zones are amazing, what's happened. We're supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it, reducing the cost of child care, and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pockets directly thanks to the Republican child tax credit. People don't know that. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of Washington bureaucrats. We repealed the ridiculous waters of the United States rule, which was basically taking away your property. And we are taking the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington, DC. We're just on it, and thank you very much Secretary Bernhardt. Just up here, nice, slim, beautiful looking man. He looks beautiful. When you work with him he's beautiful because he gets it done, and you're moving it and it's headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great American west should live right here in the great American west. And we have ended the war on American energy. It was a war, and we're up here and we're doing it. We are right now energy independent, can you believe it? They want to use wind, wind, wind. Blow wind, please. Please blow. Please keep the birds away from those windmills, please. Tell those beautiful bald eagles, oh, a bald eagle. You know, if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for a long time, but the windmills knock them out like crazy. It's true. And I think they have a rule, after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year. Do you believe this? Do you believe this? And they're all made in China and in Germany. Siemans. And for those of you that want to hear it, when they're making them, more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone, the atmosphere. More stuff is going up there, they're making it, ay, ay, ay. And they don't say this, but after a period of time they get tired, they get old, they get rusty, and a lot of the guys say, hey, their useful life is gone. Let's get the hell out of here, and they're all over the place. You look at Palm Springs, California. Take a look. Palm Springs, they're all over the place. They're closed, they're rotting, they look like hell. Every major Democrat running for President wants to entirely eliminate American production of oil and natural gas, crushing Colorado's economy, destroying tens of thousands of Colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state. They're doing that. Look, you're going to vote for one of these people, probably crazy Bernie. He seems to be leading. Mini Mike, I thought he might come up, but he can't because he can't debate. He wasn't meant for the camera, do we agree? He wasn't exactly great last night. No, I think he lost too last night. Only in Colorado could somebody say that. No, you're going to probably … it looks like Bernie, doesn't it? It looks like crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie's not big into natural gas and oil, and the things that keep our great factories and plants going. But Colorado voters will never let it happen. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO. But under this administration, all of that is changing. The era of economic surrender is over, thank you. It's over. Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. Incredible deal. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state. Also, something we got that people don't talk about, if you love your children, you don't have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses. If you love your children, it's great, and if you don't love your children, don't worry about it. Who in the hell knows. If you don't love them, don't leave that beautiful farm to your children. Give it to somebody else, okay? If they don't treat you well, give don't leave them a damn thing. Are you listening, Donnie? Are you listening, Donnie? I also took … no, it is true. That's a big deal. Farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their … people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth. You couldn't do it. They'd go out … your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money. They'd end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years. You know what happens. And they're good kids, and maybe they'll never be you. They can't farm like you and maybe they can't any maybe they can, maybe they're better. But you know what? They'd go out and they'd borrow a lot of money and they'd lose the farm. The numbers are staggering. We got rid of it. No more death tax, no more inheritance tax. And I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. What they've done to us over the years, we were losing 200 billion, 300, 400, 500, not million, billion. Billion. Not million. 500 million would be a lot. We're talking about 500 billion, they were taking it. Our strategy worked. We put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion. Billions of dollars poured into the United States. They devalued their currency and they pumped money in. We didn't pay for it despite the fact that these guys … they like to say they did, we didn't pay for it, and I'll tell you what. China- They like to say they did. We didn't pay for it. I'll tell you what, China came to the table, and we made a deal that's great for us and hopefully it's great for them. Last month, as you know, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports $250 billion worth of purchases, $50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase, $50 billion. You know the most they ever purchased were $16 billion. You know that story. I've told it a couple of times. $16 billion was the most ever. Secretary Sonny Purdue agriculture, he's done a great job. I said, ""Who's the most? What's the biggest year?"" ""$16 billion, sir."" I said, ""All right, make it 20."" So they agreed on 20 so now we're getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. We're getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA. We're getting ready to close it. I go over, I say, ""What do you have down for the farmers? They've been great,"" although I have been helping you out. I gave you a lot of money. I gave you a lot of money. $16 billion on year, $12 billion from the year before. I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it. But I said, ""So tell me fellas, let me ask you, what do we have? What's the number?"" "" 20 billion, sir."" They're going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products. I said, ""Make it 50. Tell them to make it 50."" So, we went to China and they were great. You know they got 1.5 billion people. You got a lot of feeding to do. I said, ""Do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50?"" ""No, no, no, no, no,"" and they agreed to do it. They agreed to it. I don't think you're going to be able to make it. You better be able to make it. I don't want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, I'm sorry we can't produce that much, sir. I said, ""Our farmers will find a way. They'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land."" Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. No, but it is true. I've had people say, ""Sir, they can't produce that much."" I said, ""Forget it."" They will. Look at them. You're a farmer. They'll figure that one out. Although Mike Bloomberg said you'll never figure it out. They'll figure it out long before him. You'll figure that one out long before him. No, I know the farmers. I'm not worried about it. $50 billion on no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration. Every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives. This region alone, last year ICE officers arrested over 2000, and by the way, our ICE officers, these guys are tough and they're brave. Over 2000 criminal aliens, that's MS-13 gangs, thousands, and they bring them back to where they came from. By the way, now their countries take them back. They weren't taking them back, safe third agreements. They take them back. Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. We bring them back and in some cases we don't even want to bring them back. We have to put them. I don't want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what? We don't want to take chances either, but we'll bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. We bring them back. They didn't use to take them. They said, ""We don't want them back. Oh, okay, we'll keep them ourselves."" We don't do that anymore. In Denver, an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times, attempting to murder him his own home. The alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years. Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country. In communities across the nation, radical, and we're watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities. Last year, Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals. As a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community. In Denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man. We just caught him for attempted murder. Right here in Colorado Springs, El Paso County officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping. They released him straight into your community. These are the Democrats. These are your Democrats. Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally. Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for Cory, vote for Trump, vote for the Republican party. We're getting it done. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we've reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release. You know what you do? You catch him. You say, ""Where do you live?"" They don't live here. They don't have an address. ""Where do you live? Give us your address."" They don't have an address. Many are criminals. Many are very dangerous criminals. So they're saying, and we are building the wall. It's gone up 122 miles as of yesterday. It's a serious wall. Did you hear? Two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and they're pouring the concrete, and a lot of, it's Mexico, it's very rough territory, some of it. It's partially desert. We were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm. So we hadn't put it in. We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trump's wall fell down. It was blown down. But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. It's true. We lifted it up and we held it up. When the storm went by, we had it set and it's set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. Can you imagine? I said what happened in a certain area, and we're doing a great job by the way, in New Mexico. New Mexico is going to be a great, great state for the Republican party, and Arizona, what we're doing on the border in Arizona, they want us to do it badly. But can you imagine that? A thing falls over because the concrete was just poured, it's soaking wet and it falls over, and they make it sound like the wall fell down. These are very, very dishonest people, but you know that. Border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded. It's horrible what's happening, the largest amount ever recorded. We've deported record numbers of gang members, especially the MS-13 gang members, but there are others that are just as bad. We've done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country. The border is going to be very soon secured. We'll have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their great private coverage that you want. While the Socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare, and trying to destroy your social security, that won't happen with me, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great, great healthcare, already done a good job. We're defending your right to keep the doctor, and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember, President Obama 28 times, he said, ""Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan."" Right? It was a lie. We should impeach him. We should impeach him. Impeach Obama. Get him out of office. No, nobody thought of that. We caught him in a lie 28 times at least. He's on record. We caught him in a lie, but nobody said let's impeach him. Only these maniacs, crazy Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer. What about the little pencil neck, right? Pencil neck. He's got the world's smallest neck. Here's a guy that lied about my statement. He made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract. He made up a statement. It was totally fiction. He made it up and then they tell me, you're getting ready to sue him, and they say, ""Oh no, he's protected because he made the statement in the halls of Congress."" That should be worse. No, that should worse. Little wise guy. We're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office. We're now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they're better. They're better. We're protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will. We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency. That's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way. Watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. We have totally transform veteran's health care, including getting the long sought VA choice and VA accountability. So, now if our veterans have to wait in line, they go out to a doctor, a local doctor, we pay the bill and they're all set. They don't have to wait for six weeks. He's agreeing, right? Good. Right? You don't see those stories. You used to see all these horrible vet stores, veterans, the veterans on television, and you don't see it because veterans choice, it's amazing. Our great veterans, here's a man right here. You're saying, yes. Purple Heart. Thank you. Thank you. That's great. But it's a lot different under Trump, isn't it? A lot different under Trump, and now you go out to a private doctor, but you know, we also got accountability. They've been trying to get these things done for 45, 46, 48 years, couldn't get them done. I'm good at getting things approved. I have to say. But, we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets. If somebody isn't doing a good job, you couldn't fire him. Now you look at him, you say, ""Get the hell out of here. You're fired."" We passed another thing. For 44 years, they've been trying to get it passed, the spectacular Right to Try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, Right to Try. I hope that nobody in this room needs it. I hope you don't need it, but if you do, we have the best in the world, and we're seeing amazing results. We're combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. All of the radical Democrats in the Presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the very moment of birth. You know that. That is why at my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. That's what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. People forget that. People forget Honest Abe. He's the most presidential guy. I've always said I could be more presidential than anybody, but I'm not sure I can beat Honest Abe when he wears the hat. That hat is too much. It's so easy to be presidential, so easy. It's so much easier than doing what I have to do, but you know what I'd have? I'd have about three people in the front row. How about sleepy Joe? How about his performance? What? What? It's great to be with the great people of Ohio. Joe, Joe, you're in Iowa. You're an Iowa. Oh, wow. He did it five times. So far, I've never done it. Thank you. I've never done it. If I do it, that's a bad sign. Now he does it all the time. He was in New Hampshire and he said he was in Vermont. It's great to be in Vermont. Joe, you're in New Hampshire. Dammit. He'd go up and tell him again and again. Joe, what the hell is wrong with you, Joe? Sleepy Joe. He's sleepy Joe. He was sleepy a long time ago, but now he's really sleeping. But it's easy to be presidential. You know that. The easiest thing you could do is presidential. Never open your jacket. Never. It's got to be buttoned up. Right? Ladies and gentleman, the President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's so great to be with the people of Colorado. Thank you, everybody. Good night. Good night. No, no. It's so easy. It's so easy, honestly. Look, I did very well with the State of the Union, right? They said it was one of the best. Smart, smart. Smart guy. We do good. We're representing you. I better do good. If I didn't do good, you'd dump me so fast. Actually, I don't think you would dump be so fast, actually. You want to know the thing? She said, ""we're never dumping you."" Fake news CNN went up to a woman. ""What does it take for you to leave the President?"" ""I'm not leaving him."" There were 10 women, and the one woman, beautiful, incredible women, and they had their bandanas, they had hats, Trump, and stupid CNN, they go up, ""What does it take for you?"" Then he goes, ""Look, he said one time that his people are so good, they'd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue."" Do you remember? Right? "" Would you stay if he shot somebody?"" This is actually an answer, or something to the effect, ""Would you say every shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue?"" The woman looks, ""Well, it depends why he shot him."" Makes sense. Depends why he shot him. But then they said, ""We're not leaving him. We're never leaving him."" We're in thing together, folks. We got the swamp. We got that dirty, rotten swamp. We got crooked politicians. We got a lot of bad people, but we're getting them out one by one. We better be, little Adam Schiff, that little Adam Schiff. What a crooked politician. He's a corrupt politician. Talking about guys, he'll lie and then the next day get caught. He'll be sorry that he got caught. The next day he'll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing. He's got no shame. He's got no shame. He's a liar. I think he's a sick person. Republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. You know that we're the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We have the big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, it's a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. To uphold the new rule of law, we have confirmed 217 brand new, beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. That's a record. That is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime. So, think of it. If they're 40 years old, if they're 45 years old, they can be there for 40, 50 years. As you know, and by the way, that's a record by a lot. I have the record, but there's one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record. Who has the percentage? Do you know? George Washington, 100%. But it was only 16 people. So, with 217, can you imagine that? It's a record and we're going up. We're going up. The Democrats are thrilled about that one, and as you know, I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme court justices, Colorado zone, right? Colorado. That's right. Colorado zone, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Neil Gorsuch, that's right. Colorado. He's a great guy, too, great guy. Colorado. That's a big thing. That's another great check you have down for count. Neil Gorsuch. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. They said they were going to do it for years. We recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our investments in the United States military include more than $300 million this year. Has anyone ever heard of a place called Fort Carson? Another place, Peterson Air Force Base, you know that. Another place, the Air Force Academy, you know that, and Schriever, right, Air Force Base Schriever. Schriever. Was that right? Schriever, right? Schriever, that's a little tricky one. It took me a little while. I'm looking at that sucker. I'm saying, ""Schriever, right."" Thank you. That's very nice. He saw he was having a little trouble with that one. That's tricky. You don't like to mispronounce a word. You come to a great place like this and instead of calling it Fort Carson, you go at Fort crasson, and they say, ""Oh, this guy doesn't know anything about us."" No, a lot of money going into Fort Carson. It's great. For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. You saw that. Well, I'd like to apologize. We don't apologize. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Colorado. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020, November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. We'll get it finished. We'll get it finished. They're bad people. They're all over the place. They're bad people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. You know that. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact great new trade deals like we've been doing. I'm going to India next week and we're talking trade. They've been hitting us very hard for many, many years, but I really like Prime Minister Modi. We got to talk a little. We've got to talk a little business. They've been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs. One of the highest in the world is India. But I hear they're going to have 10 million people, they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful. But you know what, and the only problem with doing that, Prime Minister Modi said, ""We will have 10 million people greet you."" Here's my problem. We have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn't get in. It's going to look like peanuts from now on. I'll never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied if we fill up a 60,000 seat stadium? Big deal. See, I'm getting spoiled. He said, ""Build a bigger stadium."" That's good. Colorado, very good. But it's going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. That beautiful phrase. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer. They've made such progress, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We started a year ago. It should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then. They didn't start it, but we're starting it. We'll have it done within nine years. It's a 10 year process. Think of that. AIDS. we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have a lot of that action happening right here. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. That's a big one. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one, beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, from Pueblo to Fort Collins, from Denver to Durango, from Black Forest to Broomfield, from Castle Rock to right here in Colorado Springs, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, and sweat, and soul, to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. Colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the Rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America's thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Colorado, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you people of Colorado."
Trump,"Thank you. Thank you very much. Hello Dallas. It's great to be with you tonight. Thank you. I am thrilled to be here deep in the heart of Texas where we just opened a beautiful new Louie Vuitton plant. I'm with the freedom loving Patriots of the lone star state. I love it. There has never been a better time to be a proud Texan and there's never a better time to be a proud American. There never has. Never has. I came from a small town, Alvarado, Texas where we celebrated the incredible revival of American manufacturing and we opened up some beautiful places. I'll tell you, this place is doing great and created in a very short period of time an extra 1000 jobs for Texas. Since my election, we've created 775,000 new jobs across your state including 70,000 Texas manufacturing jobs. They said those jobs had disappeared, didn't they? Huh? Hey man, our country is once again living by two simple rules, buy American and hire American. The economy is booming. Our people are prospering. Our country is thriving and our nation is stronger than ever before. But the more America achieves, the more hateful and enraged these crazy Democrats become. Crazy. They're crazy. They're crazy. At stake in this fight is their survival of American democracy itself. Don't kid yourself. That's what they want. They are destroying this country but we will never let it happen. Not even close. For three straight years, radical Democrats have been drawing to overthrow the results of a great, great election. Maybe, maybe the greatest election in the history of our country. They want to oppose an extreme agenda. They cannot pass it and they cannot win it at the ballot box. They're not going to win. The not even going to get … they won't come close in 2020. They know it. They know it. They're not going to win it. They say, let's see. What's another idea? What's another idea? How do we win this election? You know, I really don't believe anymore that they love our country. I don't believe it. Crazy Nancy. Think of that. That crazy Nancy. She is crazy. And shifty Schiff. How about this guy? He makes up my conversation, which was perfect. He makes up my conversation. He sees what I said. It doesn't play well because it was perfect. So he made up a totally false conversation with the Ukrainian president and we caught him cold. Everybody knew it anyway. See, we did one thing. You always have to do the unexpected. They never thought I'd released the conversation with the Ukrainian president. I want to get him before Congress and I want to see what he has to say. You know, they say he has immunity. Why would you have immunity for outright fraud? Why do you have immunity? Why? He's a fraud. We're fighting a campaign against leftist, socialist, and globalists who want to return to reckless wars, open borders, rampant crime, and totally disastrous one way trade deals. We're changing that one around very quickly. They believe America is the world's piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy, military and defense of every other nation in the world but our own. It's not happening anymore. Our political opposition made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens. And you know that's what's been happening. And that's why 2016 was so important. And that's why 2020, I can never say it's more important, but you know it's like the roots of a tree. You plant the baby tree, it's got to catch, get that extra time. We'll have more tax cuts. We'll have even … I'll tell you what, we have rebuilt our military. What we've done has never been done before. The do nothing democrats have betrayed our country and that great betrayal is over. We are finally again, and we've been doing it now for almost three years. Can you believe we've been doing this for three years? Can you believe it? I've been a politician for three years. I can't believe that. I never thought I'd be called a politician. I don't like it. But it is what it is. But we're finally again putting America first. The radical Democrats want to destroy America as we know it. They want to indoctrinate our children and teach them that America is a sinful, wicked nation. You see that happening all the time. And I know it from personal experience. What they want to teach your kids, not good. They come home, mommy, daddy, this is what I learned. And you're going, oh no, don't tell me. Let's get them into another school fast. They want to disarm law abiding citizens. They want to take your guns away. They want to install far left judges to shred our constitution. It's not happening. They want to tear down symbols of faith and drive Christians and religious believers from the public square. They want to silence your voices on social media and they want the government to censor, muzzle, and shut down conservative voices. You know that. If they didn't hate our country, they wouldn't be doing this to our country. They wouldn't be doing it because they know better. They know better. As an example, we're building a great wall along the Southern border and it's going up rapidly. Going up. And you know, five years ago almost every one of them wanted a wall until I came along and I said, we're going to build a great wall because they could never get it done. Then they stopped the funding. They made it almost impossible. Few people would've been able to do what we did, but we got it from here and we got it from there and we got it from all over the place and we're building that sucker right now and it's having a tremendous effect already. Not easy. Highest level. Everything we said it would be, it's moving rapidly. Although the fake news back there, they don't want to talk about it. They don't want to talk about it. Look at all those cameras. You believe it. Look at all those red lights. Don't worry. I won't say anything bad about your network because a lot of times I get ready to do a number of these phony networks and you know, you see those red lights go off, off, off, off. They don't want their viewers to see it, but that's okay. I'm not going to say it tonight. I'm going to say you're legitimate media. I don't actually mean that. But you look at that. But look at all those cameras. You know that's like the Academy Awards used to be before it failed. You know why it failed? You know why it failed? Because they came after us. That's why it failed. It failed because they had stupid people saying horrible things about us. Stupid. stupid people. They are stupid people and their ratings have dropped like a rocket. I love seeing it. I'm telling you. Love it. But no matter how hard they try, they will fail because the people of Texas and the people of America will never surrender our freedom to those people right there. We will stand strong for family, faith, God, and for country. Last week, a very dumb Democrat candidate for president, that's the end of him in this state, pledged to revoke the tax exempt status of many churches and religious charities. By the way, that was after a few weeks ago. He said, excuse me, we're going to take your guns away. That doesn't work well with me. I called him right. Remember the flailing arms? Nobody noticed it. I noticed it. The flailer. You remember he was flailing all over the place. I said why is this guy hot? John Cornyn's going to win so easily. Just like Ted Cruz won. He's going to win no matter what happens. But John Cornyn is not talking about Beto anymore because Beto, in a few short weeks got rid of guns and got rid of religion. Those are not two good things in Texas to get rid of. I will never allow the federal government to be used to punish Americans for their religious beliefs. I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon, except in the case of myself where they use it against me. The radical left tolerates no dissent. It permits no opposition. It accepts no compromise. These people are crazy. And it has absolutely no respect for the will of the American people. First it was the Russia hoax. Then it was the smearing which continues, that disgraceful, disgusting smearing of a fine man, Justice Kavanaugh. And now they continue the outrageous impeachment witch hunt with nothing. With nothing. They come after me, but what they're really doing is they're coming after the Republican party and what they're really, really doing is they're coming after and fighting you. And we never lose. I'm fighting for everyone who believes in the values, traditions, and principles that have made our nation the greatest in the history of the world. And I have to say this, we are far greater now than ever before. You go back four years, you go back seven, six, eight, even you go back into another administration, you go back 10 and 12 years, where were you compared to where you are right now? We must hold the Democrats accountable for their lies and their corruption. They are corrupt people. And we must show and vote and we have to go out and we have to win this election coming up. It's going to be a landslide and we have to make it a landslide. Today's do nothing democrats, they don't do anything. Where's the USMCA? Everybody wants it. The Democrats even want it and crazy Nancy won't let anybody vote on it. She's nuts. Today's Democrats believe anyone who opposes them must be crushed. It's not just like, let's win. You know, I have to say this. The Republicans said, I'm not sure I like this because my life hasn't been this way, but the Republicans play a much softer game. They really do. When all of our stars, and we have great stars, when they went to our speaker of the house at the time and they asked for subpoenas, oh, let's take it easy. Let's … okay. I mean, I get that too. She hands them out like it's cookies. Here. Subpoena. I heard a commentator who happens to be standing right there the other day. Doesn't like us at all. But said, I've never seen anyone hand out so many subpoenas. I have people getting subpoenas I never heard of. I said, who are those people? Never saw anything like it. It's a disgrace what they're doing to our country. We became, because of what they do, not the Republicans and not what we've done because what they've done and what they see. When people come to my office, which is now the oval office, which is your office too. Presidents, Prime Ministers, Kings, Queens. I hate to say it. Sometimes dictators, they just don't like to go by that title. They say, sir, congratulations sir on what you've done. Congratulations on what you've done. It's incredible. Your economy is the greatest on earth. And let me tell you it, if my crooked opponent would have won the election right now China would be by far the number one nation from an economic standpoint in the world. We've gone up trillions of dollars. They've gone down trillions of dollars, and we are so far number one, so far that they'll never catch us if we are smart right here. But the do nothing Democrats believe anyone who opposes them has to be crushed. They don't want to just beat them. They don't want to just beat him. These are sick people. They want to crush these people. The anger, the hatred, and that any lie or crime or corruption is justified so Schiff gets up and makes up my statement. He makes it up 100% and then he said he didn't speak to the whistle blower. No, we didn't see the whistleblower. And what about the whistleblower? The whistleblower got it all wrong. Who's the whistleblower? Who's the whistleblower? Who is the whistleblower? We have to know. Is the whistleblower a spy? And who is the IG that did this? All he had to do is look at the tape or look at what they wrote down, the transcribed version of the phone call. Compare that to the whistle blower's account and you see it had nothing to do with it. So why does the IG allow a thing like this to happen to our country? Why? Why? Got a lot of bad people out there, but one by one we're advancing. One by one. Just look at the terrible foreign corruption of the Bidens. I hate to talk about him. You know why? I don't think the guy's got a chance. Sleepy Joe. I don't think he's got it. I don't see it. I don't know. I've got these great, brilliant senators over here. I have all these congressmen over here. Fellows I don't think he has a chance. I'd like him to. I'd like him to. You know I thought Pocahontas was gone, left in embers. You got to give her credit. Those embers, they kept going, going, going. Now it looks like she's doing better. But I don't think Joe has a chance. But did you see the other night where CNN, in a totally unsubstantiated statement, the president said this about you. We're so sorry he said that. His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China. These were not the same Chinese people I just dealt with. I will tell you that. But Joe Biden was in charge of Ukraine policy while his son with absolutely no energy experience just got thrown out of the Navy like a dog, was paid massive sums of money by a Ukrainian energy company. You know that's called? It's called a payoff, folks. He didn't no energy at all, knew nothing about energy. They hired him, paying him massive amounts of money, much more than the $50,000 a month you heard about. That's a lot. That's a lot. But much more. Joe Biden made them go out and fire the prosecutor on tape. But they don't want to show the tape. I had to put it up on my social media site. They don't want to show the tape where he was bragging. You're not going to get this money unless they get rid of … and boom, they got rid of the prosecutor. He was investigating the son and the son's company. Got rid of him. Now that's what you call quid pro quo. While these charges are totally unsubstantiated. These are the fake newsers out there. And then Biden flew. Think of it. He goes into a tough place. We just met such a great deal with China. Just think of this. My guy said, if we could get 20 billion in agricultural product, that would be good. The most China ever did was 16 billion for our farmers. Okay. We're just talking about the farmers. We did banking. We did everything. But we're talking about them. The most they ever did was 20 billion of product from our farmers. Our great farmers. Our patriot farmers. Our farmers that never left us even though they were being targeted by China. They never left me. So they wanted 20 in China agreed. I said, nope, no good. I want 50 billion, not 20 billion. 50. So my guys say, sir, we have a problem, sir. Our farmers cannot produce that much. It's true. I said, tell them to go out and get bigger tractors, right? John Deere case, Caterpillar, all American. Only American tractors. We only buy American tractors. Go out and get bigger. So now China's agreed. They've already started buying. Hopefully the agreement gets signed sometime prior to a big summit that we have with president Xi and others in Chile. That's in about four weeks. But they give this. They said, sir, they can't produce $50 billion. I said, I want the farmers to tell me … remember the story about winning? We're going to win so much. We're going into the White House. We're going to tell the president, sir, we just can't stand winning. The state of Texas, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, they're going to come into my office. Sir, we just can't stand this winning in Texas anymore. It's too much. We can't handle it. Well, that's what I want from the farmers. I want the farmers to say. I want the farmers to say, sir, we just can't produce that much product. We can't do it, sir. And I'm going to say yes, you can. And they're going to say, no, we can't. I'm going to say yes you can. And they're going to go out and they get to take in 50 billion from China as opposed to 20. That's what's going to happen. That's what's going to happen. But they were great. They stuck with us through thick and thin. Now it's really working out for a lot of different groups. In the meantime we've taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs and China's eaten the cost because they devalued their currency and they put money out. Tens of billions of dollars. It's cost us nothing. Billions and billions and billions. You know what I did for the farmer? During the lean times, I gave them 16 billion last year and 12 billion the year before. $28 billion altogether came out of the tariffs that I had a lot of money leftover and nobody complained. You know our farmers didn't want that money. Our farmers didn't want it. True story. Everybody comes for money. Countries come for … everybody wants money, right? They all want our money. The farmers said, sir, we don't want this money. It's a subsidy. We don't want it. I said, no, it's not a subsidy. You're being targeted unfairly. They said, no, sir, it's a subsidy. This is true. I had 35 farmers in the oval office. Incredible people. They didn't want it. They said, sir, just give us a level field. So now I gave them a field that's more than level. It's level like this. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. But the farmers, I call them the great patriots the farmers. I never lost them. They always said, yeah, I'm in trouble. I got a problem. But this should have been done many, many years ago by other presidents and other leaders. And we lose for many years $500 billion a year with China and many other countries we lose billions. We lose with everybody. But that's all changing now. But we lose 500 billion, not million. 500 millions is a lot, right? We lose 500 billion. And you know what? It's a disgrace that that was allowed to go on for 25 years. It was a disgrace. Disgrace. But now we're taking in billions of dollars. They've had the worst year they've had in 27 years and we're having the best year we've ever had. So that's good. That's good. So Biden flew with Hunter on Air Force 2. They flew to China. Hunter walked out of the plane, had a quick meeting, walked away with one and a half billion dollars. These characters back there said, oh, that's okay. There's no problem. Can you imagine if Don or Eric Trump or Ivanka Trump, who's here someplace … right here. And by the way, our great First Lady is home watching this. She said, this is the most exciting thing I've seen in a long time. You're a great First Lady. Doing a great job. She's doing a great job. We're doing a great job. The whole country now is doing a great job. So Biden takes 1,500,000,000 and he goes on and he allows China to rip us off. Remember he said a year ago? No, no, China's good. They've done nothing wrong. They are wonderful people. They are all wonderful people. I don't blame China, by the way. I blame our leaders for allowing this horrible, you know what and pillage. It's the R word. You know what and pillage. You know what word I'm talking about, right? I don't want to use it because they'll say it's a horrible word that Trump used. So the Biden's got rich while America got robbed. Tonight we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the Democrat party and nobody ever pays the price with the Democrats. They're so deep seeded. They never pay the price. They never pay. But maybe soon that will start. You know, we've had a lot of, we've had a lot of Obama people and Clinton people and some, to be honest with you, we've had some pretty bad Republicans down deep that didn't exactly love us. But slowly they're getting out. They have all sorts of protections. He says get rid of them. Yeah, we're trying. Get rid of them. But their partner in the whole thing is the fake news media. That's the problem. Because the Democrats and the fake news media, it's a partnership. Remember that. And you see it all the time, and I've never seen it to this extent. You know, when I won in the primaries and then I won the election, I was treated horribly by the media, horribly. And then when I won the election, we had the greatest night, one of the highest rated nights in the history of television all over the world. And I won. And I said, oh, the great thing. I said to Ivanka, I said to the first lady, I said to anybody that would listen, I said, listen, this is so great. Finally, finally, we, all of us, we're going to be respected by the media. And you know what happened? They got worse. They're worse now than they ever have been. They're crooked as hell. They're worse now than they've ever been. They're crooked. The only message these radicals, and they are radical lefties, will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd, 2020. Save that date. With your help, we will win back the house. We … With your help, we will win back the House, we will keep the Senate, and we will keep the White House in numbers like they haven't seen in a long, long time. Joining us tonight are many terrific Republican leaders, and they are terrific. And frankly, if they're not, I'm not going to introduce them, okay? But we have some great leaders, and you have great leaders in Texas. Great leaders, and they love Texas. A friend of mine, a guy that a lot of people weren't so sure, we had this unbelievable relationship. In fact, when Ted Cruz held a rally in Washington, he said, ""Could you come to my rally?"" And everybody thought, these people thought that was strange. They said to me, ""Well, when is the fighting between these two?"" Because we really like each other. ""When's the fighting going to start?"" Right, Ted? They said, ""When is the fighting going to start? And I said, ""Don't worry, it'll start. And when it does, it's going to be vicious."" And it was vicious, and now we love each other again. He's great. Ted Cruz. And he had a great victory against a man that spent almost $100 million dollars. That's a lot of money. Spent almost $100 million, but that was a great victory. Thank you, Ted. Another man who's currently running against somebody. I kept thinking maybe Beto will jump in because he's at zero right now. We hope he's going to jump in. Remember, no religion and no guns. I think that's not good. Oh, and I think he's like pretty light on oil production too. But a man and John, I have no idea who you're running against, but nobody's going to be able to beat John Cornyn. He's a good man, you're good man, thank you, John. And we have a lot of Congress people here. We have a woman who's fantastic, who has been a fan of ours right from the beginning, Kay Granger. Thank you, Kay. We have a man who's smart as hell and he is tough and he is mean and nasty, but he loves this state and he's only mean and nasty because he wants to defend you and me and all of the horrible things that we all go through, Louie Gohmert. Louie, he's a great guy, been a great friend of mine. I'll tell you once we got him on board, he wouldn't leave us no matter what. And he had Mueller and everybody figured out long before anybody else had it figured out, right, Louie? A person who's been an incredible ally, again, loves your state, Randy Weber. Thank you Randy. Great job, thank you. One of the best lawyers you'll ever find. He's slick, he's smooth, but boy he's loyal, he's talented and he's got them all buffaloed because they're not as good as him, John Ratliff, thank you John. A man I saw on television last night defending me, brilliantly defending me. I actually don't like doing this usually, but I tweeted out, I said, ""Thank you very much Brian Babin. That was a great defense, I appreciate it."" Thank you Brian, that was great last night. See I put a tweet out because it's easier than making a phone call and talking for a half hour, thanks Brian. I just said thanks. And you know what, he'd rather have that too actually, right? And Lance Gooden, special person, Lance Gooden,, thank you Lance. Thank you, Lance. And Lance was one of 60 people that stuck in there, he was unbelievable. And Ron Wright, thank you, Ron. Great job. Great job. These are great people. These are great people along with Republican party chairs and all of these total winners. Here's one, Ronna McDaniel, I'll tell you what, you know, Ronna was the head of Michigan. Michigan hadn't been won by a Republican for decades and it was tough. They all said you couldn't win Michigan. I said, ""Why? We're getting these massive crowds, why""? And she was in charge of Michigan and I said, ""I want you to do me a favor. Find out who this woman is. She's driving me crazy. She calls me, Just one more trip, sir, one more trip. Who is she? Who is she?"" And it was Ronna and we won the State of Michigan, we won. And when it came time, when it came time to picking somebody to head the RNC, Republican National Committee, I said, ""What about that woman that drove me crazy from Michigan?"" And it was Ronna and she's done a fantastic job. Thank you, thank you, Ronna. Thank you, she's fantastic. And a great governor from your state, he's a great, great man and a friend of mine. And together with your Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. Well you had a hurricane, two years ago now. They still keep calling me for money. ""Sir, could you give us another?"" When the governor called up, Dan was there, ""Thank you for being so generous to Texas, sir, the hurricane."" It was a big one, it was a bad one. A lot of water dump. I think the biggest dump of water, remember kept going in and out, in and out. Our Coast Guard saved 16,000 lives. But it kept going in and out, water, water. And finally I get a call. I paid billions and billions of dollars to the state. Like numbers, my people are driving me crazy. I get a call from the governor and Dan is there. Where's Dan? Is he here? Where's Dan? Dan, Dan Patrick. And the two of them call me. And then I had Ted Cruz on my back and I had John Cornyn on my back and I had the Congressman calling and it was brutal, it wasn't even fair. And they said, ""Sir, thank you for being so generous on the hurricane."" They made a fortune. You made a fortune on the hurricane. ""Thank you for being so generous, sir. Sir, we want one more small request, just a small, it's not much and we appreciate your listening to us. We want to build a dam in the ocean so that if we ever have another hurricane, sir, the water won't be able to come into Houston and all of the areas that have came into, sir, do you think we could do it? I said, ""How much? It's only $10 billion. $10 billion!"" Right Ted, right? $10 billion they wanted, 10. And you know the way they sell it and it's so good they're salesman, they're incredible salesman. They say it's only 10 billion. I'm supposed to be happy. Oh, let's see, could we give Texas an extra 10 billion for some, crazy thing that may work and it may not, right? No, they're great people. They love your state. RNC, co-chairman, Tommy Hicks, a real friend of ours. Thank you, Tommy. And our great campaign manager, the most sophisticated man with a computer you've ever seen. Remember they used to say with Hillary, her campaign is so sophisticated. Then after she lost, they said, Trump's campaign was so sophisticated. And remember she spent like six times more on this stuff than we did. You know the old days, my father taught me, if you can spend less, that's a good thing not a bad thing, right? My father said, if you can spend less. So we spent much less then Hillary, crooked Hillary, crooked Hillary. Where are those emails, Hillary? They may find those 33,000 emails. They're looking, they may find those deleted emails. They may find them. Remember the emails, 33,000 emails covering her gym and her daughter's wedding, 33,000 that's a lot of emails for a wedding and working out. But Brad Parscale did a great job. Thank you, Brad, thank you. Thank you, Brad. And Secretary of Commerce, one of the legends of Wall Street, he was really like amazing and he is doing an incredible job, Wilbur Ross. Thank you, Wilbur. Smart guy. And a friend of mine, he's another one. He was so tough. He was nasty, man. Boy, he hit me during the campaign. I said, ""That guy's ruthless."" And when it was sort of over, there was nobody more gracious and I called him, I made him Secretary of Energy, he's done a phenomenal job. And Rick Perry couldn't have done a better job, truly, truly. And he's going to be leaving at the end of the year and probably coming back here. Whatever he does it's going to be successful. But he spent three years with us and I want to thank you, Rick, what a job you done, thank you. What a job he's done. He was also a great governor of Texas that you know. In everything we do, we're fighting for the faithful citizens of this country. This includes putting a stop to the catastrophic era of endless wars. Endless wars, they don't stop. They don't stop. They go on forever. We become policemen. We end up becoming police, were policing these countries. That's not what it's about. We've spent eight trillion dollars in the Middle East. Thousands of American soldiers have lost their lives. Tens of thousands more have been severely wounded, and in all fairness, the other side has lost millions of people. Millions, millions of people, think of it. These wars brought mass chaos, instability, destruction and death. Today we choose a different path. We had tremendous success today. I don't know if you've seen it. We built in the last three years, we built the strongest military by far. And I told this story, I was embarrassed to tell it, but now I'll tell, when I first got in, a general told me we could've had a conflict with someone said, ""Sir, we don't have ammunition."" And I said, ""I never want to hear a president … I just never want to hear somebody have that statement made to them again as President of the United States, we don't have ammunition."" Think of how bad. Now we have so much ammunition we don't know what to do with it. And as you all know, I guess you've been watching today. I sent Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo to lead an American delegation to meet with President Erdogan of Turkey. They got there today and it did work. Without spilling a drop of American blood, not one drop of American blood. We've all agreed on a pause or a ceasefire in the border region of Syria and it was unconventional what I did. I said, ""They're going to have to fight a little while. Sometimes you have to let them fight a little while. Then people find out how tough the fighting is."" These guys know right up here, these guys know, right? Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids in a lot. You got to let them fight and then you pull them apart. But it was unconventional, but they fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious. And the Kurds, who are our friends and Turkey's our friend. But they fought, it was tougher. I mean it was nasty and you couldn't make a deal for 15, think of it, for 15 years, 20 years, they couldn't make a deal. The Kurds didn't want to move. Turkey didn't want to budge, and Turkey was having a lot of bad things happen from this region. In all fairness to Turkey, they were having a lot of bad, but they didn't … Now all of a sudden they're fighting and it's not fun having bullets going all over the place. And we went there and we said, we want to pause, and the Kurds have been terrific. They're going to move back a little bit. We're going to keep ISIS all nice and locked up, okay. We're going to find more of them. And Turkey's all set and President Erdogan one was great and we're going to take the worst sanctions and tariffs and everything that I put on the country, we put the worst, I mean, I don't think they could have economically survived, but that doesn't matter. President Erdogan was a gentleman. He understood it, but without a little tough love. You know what tough love is, right? Without a little tough love, they would have never made this deal. President Obama lost a million people in the area, a million people, a million people. So now we're doing a five day period, we're going to see if we can get it all finalized and I think it will be, I think it will be. So Turkey's going to be happy. The Kurds are going to be happy, ISIS is going to be unhappy. We'll deal with whoever we have to deal with, but we'll get it done. And it's a great tribute to a lot of very talented people and thank you to Vice President Pence and thank you to Mike Pompeo. Good job, good job and they're traveling back to our country by night. They're traveling back and they'll be back soon and we'll have a big conference on it. But it was a terrific thing and we've taken care of a lot of religious persecution. We added that in. A lot of things are in that agreement that nobody ever thought possible. So we have to fundamentally change our approach to Homeland Security as an example. In that example, nobody would've ever done that. You have to be a little bit different to do it that way. I took a lot of heat, even from some of our Congressman, even from some of our Senators, but now they're all happy and I'm happy with them. I'm happy with them. Now, I don't know what about the Democrats? The Democrats will say, ""Oh, what a terrible …"" Anything we do the Democrats will criticize. If I said, like on the China deal, ""We get Beijing for one dollar."" They would say, ""What a terrible deal."" It just doesn't work with them. You know the wall. We spend so much time with them on the wall and I realized about two weeks ago, all I had to do is say, ""We will never build a wall."" And they would have come through and they said, ""We demand that you build it."" It would have been so much easier, right. Would have been so much easier, Ted, would've been so much easier. American combat troops should not be at the center of ancient sectarian conflicts all over the world. Bring our soldiers back home. Bring our soldiers back home. The same people pushing us to fight endless wars overseas want us to open our borders to mass migration from these war torn and terror afflicted regions. Their policies would import terrorism right onto our shores with American issued visas. Oh, isn't that wonderful? And by the way, the Democrats want open borders. They want everybody to flow in. They want those caravans to flow in, the caravans. And they wouldn't get rid of the loopholes. But you know what? Mexico's been great. Mexico today had 27,000 soldiers on our border and we've stopped this horrible migration of people. And many of them are bad people. You know when countries send them up, they're not sending their finest, okay, use your heads, they're not sending their finest. You've got to see some of the people. But now we send them back. And by the way, ICE is fantastic. They've taken out thousands and thousands of MS-13 killers. They've taken thousands of killers and brought them back. And now we've made deals with Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador and Mexico. But we've made deals now where we can bring back, there are 45,000 people waiting in Mexico. But it's going to be very tough for these people ever to get back. When did you ever hear that? Used to have no people waiting in Mexico. They just flooded. Our borders are getting strong. When the wall is complete, there'll be as strong as any borders anywhere in the world. My administration believes in a simple principle, the best way to keep foreign terrorists out of America is deny them, just deny them admission in the first place. It's really pretty simple. And that is why I have imposed, and we had passed and we won at the United States Supreme Court, a travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries and places. But if Democrats seize power, they would throw the floodgates wide open, wide open. We would have people coming into our country, look at what's going on in California and the people of California don't want it, they say, come into California. We'll give you free healthcare, free education. Why wouldn't … I may even move to California if they keep going. No, but all it does is it brings everybody in. What's wrong with these people? We're rebuilding our military stronger than ever before and we are not going to deplete it again on stupid, senseless, endless wars. We've invested more than two and a half trillion dollars restoring our armed forces and all of it was built in the USA and that includes approving the construction of almost 200 F-35 fighters, stealth, stealth. And many of them are built right here, right here. You know that right, in Fort Worth. As we restore our security, we're also restoring our prosperity. America is winning again and America is respected again. And by the way, I have to say this, so outside they have close to 30,000 people. And I wonder if I could ask the Fire Marshal, fill up this little area, let them in, it would be so nice. You know they have a certain max, we broke the record tonight. Good place. Last month, unemployment reached its lowest level in 51 years. Seven million Americans have been lifted off food stamps since the election. What a great … One point three million children have been lifted out of poverty, think of that. And African American, Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels in history. Our great Hispanic American population has reached a poverty level, which is a all time low in U.S. history. And after years of stagnation, wages for Hispanic Americans are rising fast, up nearly eight percent since my election and everybody in the fake news would have said that's absolutely impossible. Medium income, think of this, median income for Hispanic Americans has surpassed $50,000 a year for the first time ever. With Republicans in Congress, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reform by far in American history. By the way, the Democrats want to raise your taxes, you know. I don't mean a little bit. I don't mean a little bit. I mean like double them up, triple them up and it's still won't pay for the nonsense they want. We eliminated a record number of regulations and we ended the war on a thing called American energy, which is very good for Texas. Since my election, natural gas production in Texas has increased 35% and oil production has increased by 60%, six oh. And the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, world. Yet every major Democrat running for president wants to abolish all production of oil and natural gas. I think they want to go to windmills, windmills, you know. ""Darling, I want to watch Trump speak tonight. We can't darling, the wind isn't blowing."" They want windmills. In other words, they want to annihilate your Texas economy. Can you imagine? No more oil, no more natural. So here we have a few people, right? No guns, no religion, no oil, no natural gas. Abraham Lincoln could not win Texas under those circumstances. Couldn't do it, couldn't do it, Ted. Couldn't do it, Louis. Abraham Lincoln, Honest Abe, couldn't do it, Louie, right? Remember I used to say I can be more presidential, look. I've always said I can be more presidential than any president in history except for Honest Abe Lincoln when he's wearing the hat. That's tough, that's tough. That's a tough one to beat. No, it's much easier, being presidential is easy. All you have to do is act like a stiff, look. Remember the last election, they said these phonies in the back, they said, Texas is in play. They said you'd toss in play too. And I came here, we had rallies like this. Thousands of people outside that couldn't get in. And I said, ""Why is Texas in play?"" They say because it's voting, it's suppression. They try and get your hopes down. They're suppressed. This is just like fake news. But they said Texas, they said Texas is in play. ""Ladies and gentlemen, Texas is play. This is CNN, Texas is in play. President Trump …"" And I had guys on from Texas and they're wearing cowboy hats. Sid and a lot of guys. They go, ""I don't know about you, but I know something about Texas and Donald Trump is not going to lose Texas. I can tell you that and Texas is not in play."" 00 o'clock and usually they have to take hours and sometimes at least even if it's big, they take a half an hour. The Texas polls have closed and usually if it's close, it takes hours. And if it's not even just like so close, it takes a long time. So they go, ""Ladies and gentlemen, the polls have closed in the State of Texas. Donald Trump has won the State of Texas. Right, Donald Trump."" And we won by a lot. We won by a lot. And we won Florida and we won South Carolina and we won Georgia and we won North Carolina and we won Pennsylvania. We won a lot. Remember these phony people, there is no way to get to 270 you had to get to … So I kept going to Maine. I love Maine, but Maine too, you get one. It's cut in half. Maine too you get one. I went there four or five times because … They got me up, the phonies, they got me up to 269, couldn't get to 270 so I went … I won, by the way, I won Maine too. I got one. But I went there and I went there a lot. That's the beautiful thing about the electoral college, you go everywhere. You don't just spend the three … winning the popular vote would be much easier. I'd rather have that. I'd go to four states and relax. I went to 21 States. I used to be a believer in the other, but I think winning … It's like you're a track star. You're working out for the a hundred yard dash or the mile, it's a different form of training. It's a different form. But we did great. They said he cannot get to 270 and they were right. We got to 306. After decades of economic surrender, I have taken historic action to confront China's- … have taken historic action to confront China's rampant trading abuses, and we've made great progress. And our relationship with China is fantastic, and great things are happening. You watch. They get it now. They get it. And a lot of good things are happening. We're replacing NAFTA with disastrous, I mean, it's been, to me, probably … I used to call it the worst trade deal in history. I think the World Trade has been … WTO, what a real beauty, the World Trade Organization. That's a real beauty. They consider China a developing nation. And because you're a developing nation, Ted, right? They consider China to be a developing nation, and because they're developing, they get tremendous … And we wrote them letters. We don't consider them to be a developing nation. We don't consider India to be a develop… because they're ripping us off. And we didn't win any cases at the WTO, and now we just won $7.5 billion of countries that were taking taking advantage of us. And we've won a lot of cases lately. We didn't win anything for years practically. Now we've won a lot of cases. You know why? Because they know I'll leave if they don't treat us fairly. They know it. And then the piggy bank is gone where they all rob from. We're replacing the NAFTA disaster. And we have to get this crazy Nancy Pelosi to put this thing up for a vote. We have to get her. And the USMCA is a giant victory for Texas farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, workers, and oil. The Democrats should pass it, overwhelmingly. They will. But Nancy has to put it up for a vote. Do-nothing Democrats. They're do-nothing. Nowhere is the Democrat betrayal of our nation more dramatic than on immigration. In recent debates, did you see these debates? Do you believe what I'm competing with? I don't know, when I had to compete with Ted Cruz, that was brutal. He was the national debate chamption, a story I've never told. I never did that before, right? I ran for office. All of a sudden, I'm supposed to be debating tomorrow night.  ""Who are these people?"" The hell, I don't know all of them. I know a lot of them. I contributed to a lot of them. They used to treat me very nice when I contributed to them. Not so nice when I was their opponent, that changed a lot.  ""Let me see, I want to see, who are these people?"" I'm going to a debate. I never debated. My whole life has been a debate, but I never debated with a podium, and this, and that.  ""Who are they?"" And we had 17 people, plus me. We had 18. It was actually not 17, it was 18. Remember Gilmore? Nobody remembers him. But we had 18 people. I said, ""Who are these people? Are they any good at debating?"" And I hired a debate coach, and he lasted for about 10 minutes.  ""This guy knows less than I do."" He didn't know anything. He didn't know anything, it's true. He said, ""Never ever interrupt while they're speaking.""  ""Okay, coach. Put me in, coach."" And after a couple of those statements, I mean … I mean, you can't beat Ted Cruz if you don't interrupt him. It's impossible. But my first … It's true. So I see, ""Let me see the cards. Let me see the whole thing. I want to see it. I need help. I'm going to be debating in front of millions of people."" And everyone's saying, ""Do you think Trump's going to be able to debate professionally?""  ""Let me see these cards.""  ""You know, he was president of his class. One guy was a good debater in college. He was this, he was okay."" But they give me the first card, Ted Cruz, and it says, ""National debate champion from Princeton."" Is that right? And then, ""National debate champion from Harvard.""  ""My potential first lady, I got a problem.""  ""Some of these guys are okay. They were only president of the class."" Almost all of them ran for president of the class. I never did. I liked playing baseball better. But I said, ""Melania,"" and I called Ivanka, I called my kids, I said, ""I got a problem. Ted Cruz was the national debate, he was the number one guy in college. He was the number one guy in law school. How the hell do I beat a guy that's that good at debating?"" But we came out okay, Ted. And Ted, Ted was tough. Smart as hell and tough. Tough. Good man. But it is true. The first card I looked at, seriously, it was Ted Cruz. And he was literally, I mean, national debate, he was the best in all of college and in law school. And he's a talented guy. No, he says. I don't think so. Every single Democrat candidate for president raised their hand in favor of giving free healthcare to all illegal aliens. They want to give more to illegal aliens than they give to American citizens. You see that. As president, I will never allow the Democrats to take away your healthcare dollars and give them to people that are in our country illegally. Can't do it. In fact, I just signed an executive action to protect American healthcare benefits for all American citizens. Among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are millions of legal immigrants right here in Texas, including millions of patriotic, hardworking Mexican-Americans who play by the rules, pay their taxes, follow our laws, and strengthen our communities. Whether you are a first-generation or tenth-generation, and every American citizen, and you do, you've been treated so badly. But you're not being treated badly anymore. You know? We got rid of the individual mandate from crazy Obamacare. Every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family, your borders, and is always loyal to you for a change. We're loyal to you. My administration has reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May. And that's with no help from the Democrats. They won't close up the loopholes. They won't close the loopholes, and we could do it in 15 minutes. And we're building the wall and we're doing all of these things, but the Democrats won't close up the loopholes. You know what the loopholes are, right? How about catch and release? You catch them. You say, ""Hello, darling, how are you? Could you please give us your name and phone number?"" They don't have a phone. ""Could you give us your address?"" They don't want to have That have a phone? Could you give us your address? They don't want to have an address that's in Honduras. ""Could you please give us your address and your name?"" They can't. They say, ""That's okay. We catch and we release,"" and they go into our country. And then we are getting them out of the country. And you know what? Some are very good people. Some are unbelievably dangerous and bad people. And we're focusing on the bad and they're getting the hell out of our country. Okay? While we're fighting for shared priorities, the American people, the Democrat Party has never been farther outside of the mainstream. They've gone nuts. Every Democrat running for president is pushing a healthcare agenda that would utterly eviscerate Medicare. My administration will always protect Medicare for our beloved seniors. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in over 51 years. People don't talk about it. The press will not talk about it. We have news conferences. We tell them this, they will not put it in the press. You have no idea how dishonest the media is. You have no idea. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. And that crackpot governor from Virginia executes the baby after birth. You saw that, right? After birth. You remember that one from last year. That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of crazy politicians, high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. They're corrupt, like Schiff is corrupt. He's corrupt. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it's the party of the American Dream. It's also the party of Honest Abe Lincoln. We forget that. We got to use that more often. Don't you think? Honest Abe. I liked Honest Abe. We've confirmed … He says ""Honest Donald."" Thank you. Explain that to them. You're right. We've confirmed 152 federal judges to apply the law as written, including two Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. When I got into office, they say the most important thing a president can do, I actually think it's defense, but they say is the appointment of federal judges. So when I got in, always, when you get in, there are none. "" How many do you have?"" ""I have none. None."" So I got to, I say, ""How many federal judges do I have?"" ""Sir, you have 142 federal judges."" ""No, you don't understand the question."" That's impossible. That would mean that President Obama didn't appoint 142 judges. You get none. Or you're doing a bad job as president because you're representing a different philosophy. Very different.  ""Actually, sir, the number is 142. We were right the first time.""  ""Obama was … He's such a wonderful president."" How are you a wonderful president when the most important thing you can do, you handed over to the Republicans. 142. How is that good? I mean, how is that good? If I were a Democrat, I wouldn't be too happy about that number. And we'll have a record number of judges by the time our term is over in 16 years, maybe 20. I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding because every time I do that, they say, ""See, he's assuming control."" We have this crazy guy on television. And he goes, ""You know …"" he's talking to a guest, he goes, ""You know he's going to win, don't you? You know he's going to win."" I mean, we've done a good job. He should be happy. But he said, "" Our military, our schools, our this, everything."" He says, ""You know he's going to win."" And the guest goes, ""Well, no, we're going to fight. We're going to fight."" ""No, no, he's going to win. And you know he's never leaving. You know that, don't you? He's never leaving. He's never going to leave."" And I thought this wacko was kidding. He's a comedian. I thought he was kidding. He's serious. He really believes that. We passed, for the veterans, VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of those great people. They've been trying to pass it for almost 50 years. They couldn't get it done. But those guys right there, and me, we got it done. And to protect American security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. You've seen it many times. ""Oh, I'm so sorry."" Now you have a president who's standing up for America and standing up for your great state of Texas.  about you. I'm doing this for you. You know, we had, in 2016, I really believe it was maybe the greatest election. I guess George Washington was good, right? But that was easy. And by the way, he did even better percentage-wise in judges than I did. He had 100%. but we could have 50%. That's not bad. And I had many more than he had. So I guess you got to give George Washington, what do you think, Ted, you got to give him something? I'd say Honest Abe, that was a pretty good election, right? Andrew Jackson, they say ours topped Andrew Jackson. But Andrew Jackson was a good election. But we had among the greatest elections of all time. But we have to now cement that election. We got to cement it. And once we do, it's going to be very hard to take this beautiful experiment apart. That'll be very hard. Because it's all about your family. It's all about your future. And it's all about the future fate of our great country. So important. With your help, we will lift millions of more citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. And by the way, thank you, Robert Jeffress, for being here, wherever you may be in this massive … Wherever you are, Robert. Where is he? He got up, he started saying, ""He may not be the greatest person."" I said … This is like four years ago, I see this guy, what a mouthpiece, this guy. And he's a man of God.  ""He may not be the greatest, he may not be the most perfect Christian. He may not know the Bible as well as some of us, but he's a leader. And I love Donald Trump.""  ""Who is that guy? I love that guy."" Robert Jeffress. Wherever. He's a great guy. Got a big, big group of people on Sunday mornings too, I can tell you. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words, that beautiful phrase, I love it, ""Made in the USA."" We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. We're doing that. Who would have believed we could do that? We're doing that. And the previous administration spent no money on that, and we're spending a lot. But think of that. Who would have thought that we're going to end, within 10 years, the AIDS epidemic in our country? Who would have thought we've advanced that far? We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that unite people all across our land and throughout the great state of Texas. This is a great state. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. Thank you. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true bedrocks of our society. We believe in the creeds of self-reliance, personal responsibility, and American independence. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country. And together, we are taking back this country, our country. We love our country. We're returning power to you, the American people. That's what we've done. From Dallas to El Paso, from Houston to Austin, from the Red River to the Rio Grande, this state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth. Texas. This is the state where William Travis, James Bowie and Davy Crockett made their last stand at the Alamo. This is the state where a small band of patriots at the Battle of Gonzalez, armed with a single canon, stared down a foreign army and declared, "" Come and take it.""  they loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. These courageous Texas patriots did not shed their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy, demolish our liberty, and destroy our proud American heritage. We will never, ever allow that to happen. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Texas. Thank you. . Thank you."
Trump,"I worked so hard for this state. I worked so hard. You just got two of the greatest trade deals, and add Japan to it, by the way. Let's make it three, 40 billion from Japan, USMCA, all done. China, all done for the farmers. It's done, that I can tell you. You're going to have to get bigger tractors and a hell of a lot more land. You've got to produce a lot of product. I don't know if you can, but, hello Des Moines. It's great to be with you. I'm thrilled to be back in American heartland with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. Great people. This November we're going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats that are right down the street. I mean, I don't even know. I just saw, New York Times, can you believe? Failing New York Times… When we leave in 10, 14, 18, 22 years from now, the New York Times will be out of business and so will a lot of others. But, did you see they did a New York Times poll, I think, and Sienna, Sienna, New York Times of Iowa, and they have me pitted against every one of the Socialists, and we're winning by a lot. Everyone. We're beating them all. We're beating them all. We're beating them all. We're beating them like they haven't been beaten before. You know all the noises about their crazy debates, nobody's watching their debates, but it's all about their debates. They don't care about the farmer. Everything out here, they love Trump, and you should love Trump with what I've done. So, we're going to win the great state of Iowa and it's going to be a historic landslide. If we don't win, your farms are going to hell. I can tell you right now. Sell, sell, they'll be saying ""Sell."" No, we love the farmers, and we love the ranchers, and we love the manufacturers, frankly. You got plenty of that too in this state. The great state, and you have a great governor, by the way. You have a great governor. But every day we're achieving extraordinary victories for the citizens of the Hawkeye State. The Iowa unemployment rate has reached an all time low in history. That's not bad. That's not bad. Oh, let's vote for Pocahontas. Let's vote for Bernie. Let's vote for sleepy Joe. He's falling asleep. Joe, Joe, Joe. He always gets the name wrong. How many times has he missed it? He's in Iowa. He says, ""Great to be in the great state of Ohio."" They say, ""Joe, you're in Iowa."" You can't do that. No matter how great you speak. If you're Winston Churchill, if you make that mistake at the beginning of your speech, it's over. You might as well just wrap it up. There's the fake news. They would just absolutely destroy you. They would absolutely destroy you. You can't do that. You can't do that, Joe, sleepy Joe, but you have these guys. You have these people. How about Buttigieg? Buttigieg. They call him mayor Pete. You know why? Because nobody can pronounce his name. Nobody has any idea. Buttigieg. They say, ""Say edge edge."" He presides over a city that's failed. It's doing so badly, in a state that's having the greatest year they've ever had, and they have a great governor also, and they had a great governor. You just heard from him, right? The great state of Indiana, so I don't see that one. Go down the line. We have some people. Let's not talk about them. What happened to mini Mike? Where is he? He's not running. He's skipping four or five states. Mini Mike. I've had him up to here. More people are working right now in Iowa than ever before. Now think of it. Think of it. Yesterday we replaced a NAFTA disaster with the incredible brand new U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement. The USMCA, you know when you have a hard time with that one, memory is a great thing. I've always had a great memory for whatever reason, but memory is a great thing. Having a great memory, but sometimes you take little clues. USMCA. Thank you, darling. I love you, too. Where is that person up? Look at that. Wow. What a good, strong voice. But you know how you remember it? The song I just walked in on. They're playing the song YMCA. So, when you're having a hard time, gee, what's U-S, just think of the song YMCA, and you'll remember it, USMCA. It's a massive win for Iowa farmers and workers of all kinds. It's a massive win and it creates some fairness with Canada. It creates fairness with Mexico. Probably the biggest reason that I ran was the unfair trade that I've seen, and one after one, China, Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea, we've made all these deals, and we have plenty left over. Plenty left over. Europe, Europe, Europe is next. I wanted to finish China before we started on Europe. I like to do them one at a time, one at a time. I'm a very organized person. But weeks ago we also signed a terrific new trade agreement with China that will boost American agriculture by $50 billion every year, and many other businesses like manufacturing, banking, finance, overall $250 billion, and you know with the farmers, because I have a place in my heart for the farmers big. I went and I saw Ambassador Lighthizer's in charge, he's fantastic. I said, ""What are you doing? We're getting ready for the final deal. What are you doing?"" He said, ""I'm putting in $20 billion."" Because I asked Sonny Perdue. He's great. You know who he is, right? Secretary of Agriculture. I said, ""Sonny, what's the biggest number that China's ever done with the farmers?"" He said, ""Sir, $16 billion last year. $16 billion."" This was two years ago. I said, ""So, $16 billion is the biggest,"" because you know, they targeted you, and now we're friends with China. In fact, maybe we've never had a better relationship and were working with them very closely on the Coronavirus. We're working with them very, very closely. We only have five people. Hopefully everything's going to be great. They have somewhat of a problem, but hopefully it's all going to be great. But, we're working with China just so you know, and other countries very, very closely, so it doesn't get out of hand, but it's something that we have to be very, very careful with, right? We have to be very careful. But I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, I said, ""Sonny, what's the number?"" 16 and 12 the year before, and you were targeted. I don't blame China. Look, they're smart. They're negotiators. They targeted Trump states. Where do they love Trump? They love him in Iowa. They love him in Nebraska. They love him in all these states. They love him in Wisconsin. They love him. We won Wisconsin. They like him and Wisconsin, and a lot of the farm states, and they targeted. The farmers came to see me and they said, ""Sir, you have to do what's right."" When the fake news would interview farmers, the farmers would say, ""No, no, President Trump is doing the right thing. It should have been done years ago. Should've been done years and years ago."" But you couldn't have made it because there was too much money, $16 billion. So, what I did is I put a 25% tariff on everything coming in from China, $250 billion, and then more tariffs on things beyond the $250 billion market. We took in billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. We still are, and then what happened? When I heard about the farmers and I saw the farmers, they were in the White House. They came to see me. I had 36 farmers and I said, ""I'm going to give you."" They said, ""Sir, we don't want anything."" I said, ""What do you mean you don't want anything? I've never heard that before."" Everybody wants money. They want every. They said, ""We just want a level playing field."" I never forgot it. They said, ""We don't want anything. We just want a level playing field, and we've been treated badly for years, for years."" I said, ""Well, you haven't been given a level playing field for many, many years, for decades. You haven't been given a level playing field. We're going to give you the levelest field that you ever had. But, but in the meantime, I'm going to give you $12 billion, out of these tens of billions that we're collecting."" Don't worry. We had plenty of left over, because we never got 25 cents from China. China took from us. We didn't take from China, right? I said, ""I'm going to give you $12 billion for the year before, and I'm going to give you $16 billion for this year."" That was last year for this year. So, they got, meaning you, a lot of you in this audience, got $12 billion, and you got 16, so you got $28 billion over that short period of time, and you were able to actually, in some cases, I guess thrive. I told Sonny, ""I want to take care of the small farmer too, not just the big monsters. I want to take care of everyone, everyone."" But, I never forgot when CNN fake news and all these people, they go around interviewing the farmers. They could never find anyone saying bad about Trump. They'd go into diners. ""What do you think about Trump? Isn't it a terrible what he's doing with the trade?"" The farmer would say, ""No, he's doing what should have been done 20 years ago."" Now, you people are going to make so much money. You're not going to do just, you know what? Just relax. Take it easy. Put it away. Enjoy your life. But you're going to make a lot of money. You're going to make a lot of money. Again, we have never had, because they respect us now, they didn't respect us. We have never had a better relationship with China than we do right now. It's a beautiful story. They respect us. The whole world respects us now. We're respected again. America is respected again. Okay? We're fighting for products made in America and grown right here in this great, great state of Iowa. To keep America safe, we have fully rebuilt the United States military. It's now stronger, more powerful, more lethal than ever before. We have all brand new equipment and it was all built in the USA. Thanks to the courage of American heroes, the ISIS caliphate has been totally destroyed and its founder and leader, the animal known as al-Baghdadi is dead. Crazy Nancy Pelosi said, ""Don't call him an animal. He's a human being."" No, he's an animal. He's an animal. Two weeks ago, at my direction, the United States military delivered another historic win for American justice. Our brave warriors launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. Qasem Soleimani. He was the mastermind of the road side bomb. He loved roadside bombs. When you see your friends and great soldiers of our country and other countries, frankly, walking around, they don't have legs, they don't have arms in some cases. Some cases they don't have both. You see them walking around, or riding around, or the most brave people, these people have the greatest attitude. I go to Walter Reed and I see him and the young man his legs were blown off. ""How you doing?"" ""Sir, I want to get back. I want to get back, sir."" I'll tell you, the spirit of these people, it may even top the farmers. It may even top the farmers, which is pretty good. But he was responsible, more than anybody else, 90% they say of these roadside bombs sent to fight us, he was responsible and he took a hard hit. He took a very hard hit. He was responsible for murdering and maiming thousands and thousands of Americans, and hundreds of thousands of other people. Not acceptable. Soleimani was actively planning new attacks, but we ended his bloody rampage forever. Yet, Washington Democrats, true, like crazy Bernie and Nancy Pelosi, opposed our decision to eliminate Soleimani, and to save American lives. That had a tremendous impact. While we're proudly creating jobs and killing terrorists, Congressional Democrats are consumed with partisan rage, and obsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax. You know, we're having probably the best years that we've ever had in the history of our country, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people? I got impeached. They impeached Trump. The best trade deals, the strongest military, I took care of the vets. We got choice. We got accountability for the vets, accountability. We got all these things and they impeach your President. No, that's not going to work. Watch, just watch. They want to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy, and overthrow the entire system of government. That's not happening, I can tell you that. Washington Democrats have spent the last three years trying to overturn the last election. Why am I not worried? I should worried. Remember Nixon, it was like a dark period, right? It's a very dark period. It was like oh, you think about it. Right? With Clinton it was not good. They say that with Johnson, it was a long time ago, none of us remember, but they say it was a very dark period. This is a happy period for us. It's a happy period. It's a happy period because we call this impeachment light. This is light. Crazy Schiff. Shifty Schiff. He's a sick puppy. He's a sick puppy. But, you know what? Today you saw it, I hit my highest poll numbers since I got elected because the American people, and frankly, people all over the world, know it's a hoax. They understand it. They know it's a hoax, and we have a great party, the Republican party. They know what's going on. They know what's going on and they're going to treat us very fairly. But, the Democrats are trying to overturn the last election. We will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in 2020. November 3, November 3, mark it off. November 3, mark it off. Was that a great day? 2016 November. Remember? He's not going to do well with this group. I did well. He's not going to do well with that group. I won that group. He's not going to do well here or there. Even the exit polls, they took it right up. You know what they didn't know about the exit polls? When people are leaving, they're always very accurate. People leave. ""Who you voted for?"" ""I voted for Trump."" ""Who you voted for?"" ""I voted for crooked Hillary. I don't care that she's a stone cold crook. I'm voting for her."" Who are you voting for? I'm voting for Trump, or Clinton, or Trump. They're always very accurate, but this time something happened. Many people, many… I like that idea. I like it. I like it. Wouldn't we like to run against her. who's tougher? Her, crazy Bernie, Biden, Buttigieg? Who would be the closest? Buttigieg. I don't know. Maybe we take another crack at crazy Hillary. Would that be okay? She was so easy. Remember that speech so innocently given talking about deplorables. Remember? Remember deplorables? But you know the only thing I didn't understand, I said, ""That's terrible."" But she said another word that was worse. Irredeemables. I said, ""Boy,"" shows you how good I am at politics, I said, ""She's in trouble. She said our people are irredeemable."" To me that was worse. Well, it wasn't that word that caught on. It was deplorable. The next day I'm speaking, and women are walking around, I'm deplorable. Everyone's got deplorable. I say, ""I think she made a bad speech last night."" But irredeemable, remember? She called them deplorable and irredeemable, and me being so brilliant, I said, ""I think that irredeemables going to get her."" No, deplorable got her. A lot her like lack of ability. Together we are going to win back the House. We are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep that beautiful, gorgeous, incredible White House. People don't realize this is a lot of work. I just left Michigan, and Michigan is booming now because of me, meaning, my people. I say to Prime Minister Abe, he's a friend of mine, ""Shinzo,"" Japan, ""You got to do something. You got these massive deficits for our country. You got to open up plants in Michigan fast, Shinzo. Fast. You've got to do it."" ""Yes, I will do it."" He'll do it, and he's doing it. Countries are coming in from all over the world. They're going to Michigan. They're coming to Iowa. They're buying your stuff again, like crazy, like crazy. They're going to Ohio. They're going to Pennsylvania. They're going to South Carolina. They're going to North Carolina. They're going to Florida. They're coming in like never before. They're all coming back. I ran on the issue trade. I ran on a lot of different issues, but trade was one of them. That was so big. To me, it was so big. I used to say, how do we allow these companies to close, fire everybody, go to another country? Mexico, wherever it may be, make product, sell the product into our country, pay no tax. Who the hell would allow this to happen? Who would allow to happen? It's like in South Korea. I went to him, I said, ""Listen, your deal is no good. We have to make a new deal."" South Korea, we're protecting them all, all these different things. I said, ""Number one, you've got to pay us more."" They agreed to. They gave us $500 million a year more. They said, ""But nobody has ever asked."" They gave us 500. That's nothing compared to what they have to do. That's okay. That's okay. They'll pay more. But you know, they made a trade deal with the United States. Hillary Clinton was in charge of the deal, right? She said it's going to produce 250,000 jobs, and she was right. 250,000. You know who it was for? For South Korea, not for us, it was for South Korea. So, we renegotiated the deal, if I have your permission, we renegotiated the deal and now we have a good deal with South Korea, okay? This deal is going to produce, remember… This deal is going to produce 250,000 jobs for South Korea. She didn't lie. Can't say she lied. She lies about a lot of other things, but she didn't lie. How is she taking her defeat? Okay? I think so. Remember the debate? Do you promise if you lose that you will support the winner and I sort of, I didn't exactly say yes. I didn't say yes, in all fairness, but I got sort of like six the 68% there. But she said, ""See he won't."" She's the one that doesn't do it. No, no, I feel badly because it's too late for her to get in. I kept hoping, but I think, honestly I think that sleepy Joe, crazy Bernie, I don't even want to put Buttigieg in, but I think they'd actually be tougher than her. During this campaign season, the good people of Iowa have had a front row seat to the lunacy and the madness of the totally sick left. This is a radical left people that we're dealing with. Today's Democrat party, I don't say Democratic party, it sounds so much better in a speech, right? Democratic party, the Democrat, but that's not their name. It's called the Democrat party. You know some people aren't allowed to say the Democrat party because it doesn't sound good. I don't even like it. I don't like the way it sounds in this speech, but I'm going to say it because I'm not looking to have them look good. Today's Democrat party is run by left wing extremists who want to massively raise your taxes, increase regulations, cancel your health plans, raid Medicare, shut down American energy, destroy your social security, they will destroy your social security, eliminate religious liberty, punish free speech, confiscate your guns, abolish your borders, and indoctrinate America's children with hateful, left-wing ideology. Other than that, they're okay. Other than that, they're fine people. In short, this election is a choice between American freedom and Democratic socialism, and in some cases, in my opinion, it's worse than Socialism. Socialism's a kind word by comparison. The Democrats will lose because America will never be a socialist country. We can't. They're all watching tonight. They're sitting in their hotel room, little hotels right down the street, and they're looking at this crowd. The press never talks about my crowds. Did you see in New Jersey a couple of nights ago? We had signups for 175,000 people. We had an arena that held about 9,000 people. We could have sold it out 15 times. Okay? They don't talk about that. You know what they talk about? They said Donald Trump who spoke before a nice crowd. If Bernie or sleepy Joe has, I mean Joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a round table. No, it's true. No, they were in a gymnasium. There were in a gymnasium, and they set up a round table, and people that went there to hear his speech are now being asked, ""What do you think of socialism?"" They just said, ""I just want to be here to watch his speech."" They set up a round- They just said, ""I just want to be here to watch a speech."" They set up a round table because the crowd was so small, and then they'll say, ""It was a brilliant round table. It was wonderful."" They never mention crowds. They never mention crowds. They never mention anything. I'll tell you, U.S.M.C.A, The biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world. Okay? It is, wait. It barely got any mention. We signed it. It barely got any mention. They talk about the impeachment hoax. They talk about all the other stuff, but the trade deal, that is going to change our country. It's going to bring growth. Wait until you see, toward the end of next year, the growth will be astronomical because of the China Trade Deal, the U.S.M.C.A, Japan, South Korea, Europe, when that happens. It will happen because they have no choice. They have no choice. But in the papers, and on the fake news cable shows, and the regular, look, NBC is horrible, the NBC Nightly News, it's terrible. The good news is people don't watch it like they used to, because they don't believe in it. They don't believe in it. And as Sean Hannity would say, MSDNC, you know what MSDNC is, right, so bad. CNN, total fake stuff. Oops, their camera just went off. Look! The camera just went off! CNN! Their camera just went off. That always happens whenever I say CNN, their camera goes off. But Americans, across the political spectrum, were disgusted by the Washington Democrats, the partisan hoaxes, the witch hunts, the con jobs. It's all a con job. And so, they don't love our country, I swear they don't. You look at Nancy Pelosi's district in San Francisco. It was so beautiful, and now it's a disgrace, being watched all over the world. Needles all over the place, everything else all over the place. I'm not going to get into it, washing down into the ocean, washing down onto their beaches, people living in tents if they're lucky. I mean you never saw anything, living on their most important entryways into what was a great city, San Francisco. What's happened? And all she does is work on the hoax and work on all of the stuff. Really, these people are very, very bad for our country. We have to take back the House of Representatives, we have to. Registered Democrats and Independents are leaving the Democrat party in droves, and we are welcoming these people, and these great voters, to the Republican Party with wide, open arms. And we are thrilled to be joined tonight by a lot of your great leaders, a lot of your really wonderful people. I'm not going to mention all the names, because all those cameras that are rolling, they don't like it when I do it, but one they don't mind is Governor Kim Reynolds. Come up, Kim, come up here! Also first gentleman, Kevin Reynolds, Kevin! Kim, come on, come on. You want to say something? Great, great job. Thank you. Oh, she was driving me a little bit batty. She would call me up, Kim, you would call. ""What about ethanol?"" I said Kim, ""I mean, I'm doing a lot for that place."" ""No, no. We want ethanol."" Then, ""we want biofuel."" Then she is asking for things I never even heard of, but we got them all, whatever that hell she wanted, we got. Right? And by the way, Joni Ernst and the great Chuck Grassley are right now in Washington fighting for fairness, fighting the hoax, fighting for all of us. They called, they said, ""Do you mind if we don't go tonight? We have to stay."" I said, ""I don't want you to be there. I want you to be where you are"" because they are fighting for us. They are great people. They are great people. And, they would call too. Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst, they would call, ""We got to help our farmers, sir."" ""Yes. Okay, we are going to help the farmer."" They were great. Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg. Thank you, Adam. Thank you, Adam. Great job, Adam. Speaker of the Iowa House of Representatives, a man with really fantastic genes, got to have like the best genes in the world. Although you had an ex-governor here that had very good genes, too. We have his son in the audience, too, but this is Representatives Pat Grassley. Those genes, those two young men have the greatest genes anyone has ever had for politics. Thank you, fellas, thanks. I sent one of them, the father to China, and he's now Ambassador to China. Do you think he is happy? Is he happy? I think so. I think he is happy. Great Governor, longest serving Governor in history, actually, 24 years. We have the Chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, Jeff Kaufmann. Great job. And just quickly, we have the world's tallest campaign manager, Brad Parscale. And Republican National Committee Co-Chair, who has done an incredible job, Tommy Hicks. And we have the great negotiator, the great man, Bob Lighthizer with us here, someplace. Where's Bob? What a job he did negotiating for you. And we have somebody that you never heard of, somebody that's a fantastic person, but you never heard of, somebody named Sarah Sanders. Have you ever heard of her? Come here, Sarah! Come on! That's pretty good! And we have a great football player, from Iowa, Matt Whitaker is here, Matt. Say something. Thank you, Sarah. Very popular. She is a terrific person, great person. Thanks to Republican leadership, American now has the hottest economy anywhere on the Planet Earth, not even close. Every Prime Minister, President, King, Queen, Dictator, whatever you want to call them, they all say, ""How did you do it?"" And, the truth is we have certain advantages, but we also have a people advantage. We have the greatest people in the world. I really mean that. Since the election, we have created seven million new jobs. The average unemployment rate, under my administration, listen to this, is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. Can you believe that? The lowest unemployment rate. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded, think of that. More than two million millennials, you know what millennials are, young, great people with a lot of future, they have gotten jobs, and their wages have grown by nearly 5% annually. That's a record. Another record is that between the ages of 25 and 34, people are now working, and that's a record, the number of people, 25 to 34. And under the so-called Trump Economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of any group. And that's a great thing. This is a blue collar boom, and that's a good thing too. That's a good thing. Earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% for the first time ever, for the first time ever. And median household income is at an all time high, just for one second, president Bush, eight years, $450. President Barack Hussein Obama, eight years, eight years, $975. President Donald John Trump, two and a half years, not three, because the numbers were taken at two and a half, now it's actually higher. Two and a half years, including the tax cuts which are massive, and including all of the regulatory cuts, and the other things you have gotten, $10,000. Think of it. You have eight years, 450. Eight years, 975. Two and a half years, think of it, $10,000. It's one of the reasons the economy is doing so well. And let the people down the road tell you about that, okay? Let them tell you about that. And those tractors that I told you to buy, your tractors will be 60 years old if they have anything to do with it. They will be 60 years old. They will be old, tired, exhausted. Your land will be exhausted. You will be exhausted. We've ended the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth, by far. We are also proudly promoting American ethanol, and I recently approved E15 to be used all year round! Biofuel also, but the Socialist Democrats want to shut down American energy. They support Representative Ocasio-Cortez. It's a real beauty. That's a real beauty. That's a beauty. I can't even believe it, but I don't want to knock it, because the Green New Deal, which would crush our farms, destroy our wonderful cows. I love cows. They want to kill our cows. You know why, right? You know why? Don't say it. They want to kill our cows. That means you are next. And they want to wipe out, totally, Iowa ethanol. They want to wipe it out. But we will never let that side get in, and by the way, that's the least of it. But I don't want to attack the Green New Deal, because they might change it. I said to her the other day, they said, ""What do you think of the Green New Deal?"" I said, ""Well, it should be studied carefully. We should look at it, look at it closely. I don't want to talk about until about two months before the election. And then I will tell you how totally insane it is."" How about this crazy Senator? How about this crazy, crazy Senator from Hawaii? They said, ""I'm totally in favor,"" not the smartest. She said, ""I'm totally in favor of the Green New Deal."" Well, that would mean there's no more airplanes. ""Oh!"" They started screaming at her in Hawaii, they said, ""How the hell are we going to get to Hawaii?"" They said, ""We're going to build a railroad."" She said that would be ""the world's longest track."" It's the world's longest. She doesn't know that they don't want airplanes anymore, and yet they fly around in brand new Gulfstreams, in brand new planes all over the place. They're flying from place to place. They're talking about the carbon footprint. ""We're going to destroy the carbon footprint! What time is my plane taking off, please?"" To lift up forgotten communities, the Republican tax cut launched Opportunity Zones, jobs, and investment, and now rushing into over 60 newly… and this is incredible, brand, newly designated Opportunity Zones right here in Iowa alone. Rich people are investing vast amounts of money. Tim Scott, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, came into my office. He said, ""I have an idea that I have wanted to do for years, but we have never had a president that could pull it off."" I said, ""What is it, Tim?"" And he talked about Opportunity Zones, first time I heard it. And we did it, and there is nothing, nobody has ever seen anything like it. Money is being poured into these communities that would have never been there. What's happening is incredible. Opportunity Zones. Remember it. For decades, politicians ran for office, promising to protect American farmers and workers. You've heard it all your lives, right? But then, they went to Washington. They looked at those beautiful marble columns, and that gorgeous ceiling painted, and all that gold, the way they used to build the buildings, they don't build them that way anymore. We could, but they just don't know how. By the way, we're building the wall. You know the wall is over a hundred miles long. It's over a hundred miles long already and moving fast. They went to Washington and they sold you out. That's what happened. They sold your jobs out. They sold everything out. Globalist politicians allowed other countries to raid our factories, ravage our farms, rob our workers, and ransack our communities. But the era of economic surrender is over, because now we are finally putting America first, America first. Before I took office, Washington looked the other way, while China stole our secrets from American agriculture. Your business, what they do scientifically, nobody understands what they have done to a seed. It doesn't sound complicated. It is genius, what they have been able to do, what you have been able to do. But those secrets were being stolen, stolen. And installed massive barriers to your exports. You couldn't do anything with exports, so people, not only China, many, many other places were stealing your secrets. Our new agreement with China will protect our intellectual property and pry open vast new markets for American beef, pork, poultry, seafood, soybeans, rice, dairy, and much, much more. But you know it is true. China is so big. 1.5 billion people. We have 350. 1.5 billion people, think of that, and we are just touching it. This deal will be so big. If it all works out, and you have the best product, the best product in the world, if it all works out, it will just keep expanding. 250 billion will end up being much, much more than that. And, I've told this story before, when we were signing, we were almost finished and I said, ""How much are the farmers getting?"" Meaning how much are they going to purchase from the farmers. And Ambassador Lighthizer said, ""We put 20 billion, sir. The highest ever was 16, so we made it 20."" I said ""Make it 50."" They said, ""What?"" And then people, even farm people, said, ""Sir, we can't produce that much."" I said, ""That's a good problem, not a bad problem."" I said, ""Make it 50,"" so we now have, in the contract, from 40 to $50 billion worth of purchase."" Make it 50, make it 50! Right, Jared? I said, ""Jared, you better make it 50."" I want those farmers to come back, say, ""Sir, sir, we can't do it. We can't produce that much, sir, what are you doing to us?"" I don't think that would ever happen? Do you think that would ever, I said they will figure a way. He's going ""Absolutely not."" Nah, I said, ""Don't make it 20, make it 50."" The U.S.M.C.A. is another colossal victory for American agriculture like you have never had before. It's time. We suffered for a year and a half, almost two years. Think of it, but not really because I was able to give you those, I won't call them subsidies. I made that mistake once with the farmers. I said to this group of farmers that came in, ""Subsidy."" I used the word subsidy. That was the worst word, ""Sir, we don't watch subsidy! Please don't ever use that word."" I said, ""I won't, I promise."" Just in that small, little grouping where you were doing nothing. It's called promises made, promises kept. Promises met. The last time I came, I never did this before, I never ran, so they all said, ""You never ran before. You can't do this if you never ran,"" so whatever happened, it happened. One by one, they started dropping out, right? And then I was left with one, Hillary Clinton, and that worked out very nicely. ""He cannot get to 270,"" remember? 270, electoral college. ""He cannot get to 270."" I went to Maine. It's true, Maine, too. It's got one point, right, one. I went there a lot, many times. Everyone said, well, they kept getting me, maybe if I have a great night, 269, but 269 loses. Right? But we got 306 to 223. 306, 223, so they were right, ""You cannot get to 270, you can get to 306,"" but not that there is… In the eight years before my election, net farm income plummeted by 20%, you know that. If you look at a chart, for 15 years actually, not eight, for 15 years, it's like a roller coaster ride down for the farmer. Soybeans. Take a look at it all. It was just a one way street. Everybody was ripping off the American farmer. Now you're going to see numbers that are going to be great. Look at even what's happened recently. It's incredible what's going on and I love it, because you deserve it. You suffered a lot, with people that were stupid. They were stupid! Under three years of my administration, net farm income has already gone up nearly 50% and will now be rising even faster. What are you going to do? You are going to vote for Bernie? You are going to vote for Bernie? Here I am on the debate stage, ""Well, net income has gone up for the farmers 50%."" Tell me, how the hell do I lose this debate? How do I lose? And based on the polls, I guess I'm not going to lose in this state. I don't think I will lose in any other state either. Because this is really true all over the country. This is happening all over the country, not just Iowa. On no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people than on immigration. Illegal immigration costs our nation hundreds of billions of dollars, drains public services, overcrowds our schools and hospitals, and threatens innocent American lives at a number that you wouldn't even believe. But we have got it closed up, but we're getting your people in. You have people that have worked for you for a long time, don't you? I know who the people that you have, and they are hard workers. We have a lot of great people. You have a lot of great people out there. Right here in Des Moines, a twice deported, illegal alien was charged with shooting and killing a woman, her 11-year-old daughter, and her five-year-old son. In this region of the county alone, last year, ICE officers arrested nearly 4,000 illegal aliens charged or convicted of heinous crimes, including robbery, rape, and murder. Yet today's Democrat Party glorifies illegal immigration. We have no idea, now we do now, but people would come in by the hundreds of thousands. We have no idea who they are. Many are fine people and all of that, but some are stone cold rapists, and murderers, and people that their countries don't want, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and even Mexico. Right now we have a love affair with Mexico because the Democrats, the Democrats wouldn't give us what we needed and I got Mexico, they're great. They put up 27,000 soldiers on our Southern border and the numbers are plummeting, 87% down. The president of Mexico is doing a great job. And we ended Catch and Release. You think that was easy? Catch and Release, you know what Catch and Release is? You catch a criminal, you take the number, and you release him into the, they would never come back. We say, come back please in three years, this is a Democrat deal. Come back if you don't mind, in three years. We release them into our country. We totally ended it through a very, very slick group of rules. Catch and Release. May we please have your address and your phone number? ""Here it is!"" ""What have you done?"" ""I got out of jail."" ""Oh, well, welcome to the United States. Please, we have a little information. Okay, and now we're going to release you, and in three and a half years, we schedule a court appearance for you."" Do you believe, this is the only country in the world. They catch somebody on the border. You're supposed to be Perry Mason. You take them to court. Other countries catch somebody at the border. They say, "" Sorry, you got to get out."" We say, ""Oh, may we have your information? We're taking you to court."" Man. Today's Democrat Party glorifies illegal immigration, vilifies the heroes of law enforcement, and pledges to dissolve immigration control entirely. They want open borders. They want hundreds of thousands of people to flow into our country. And some of those people, some of those people are stone cold killers. Some of those people, in the caravans, right? I came up with that name but they won't give me credit for that. They don't give me credit for anything. They don't give me credit for fake news. Wasn't that my term? Now they say, I see CNN, they said, ""Fake news has reported,"" no, no, you are fake news, that fake news is you. You are fake news. They turned the term around. They are reporting that fake news is reporting their fake news. Left wing politicians even support deadly sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into American communities. We don't want them. In New York City, the Mayor's Sanctuary Policy recently forced the release of a- … the mayor's sanctuary policy recently forced the release of a criminal illegal alien charged with assault. After being set free the same criminal raped, brutalized and murdered a 92 year old woman. They wouldn't give him to the ICE warriors. Their warriors. They're tough and they love our country. They're very tough and they love our country. They're taking MS-13 gang members … They're about as tough as you get, they're taking them out of our country by the thousands. By the thousands. That's a tough job but they love to do it. They love our country. Sanctuary city policies aren't just wrong, they're immoral, and they're lethal, and they really are something that has to be stopped. They have to be stopped now. What's happening is a disgrace. Thankfully here in Iowa your great Republican governor, sometimes referred to as Governor Reynolds, signed a state-wide ban on sanctuary cities. Thank you Kim. That is why we need to elect more Republicans nationwide, to end sanctuary cities in all 50 states. Thank you Kim Reynolds. You know I endorsed her, so I want to take full credit for the job she has done. I endorsed her very early, right? Very early I endorsed her. I know talent. She's done a great job. Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order, and justice. It's true. We are finding the illegal game members, drug dealers, predators, and we are throwing them the hell out of our country, ideally. We don't want to put them in prison because you know what? We got to pay for them for the next 50 years, but sometimes we have to. If they're too dangerous we have no choice. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row, and they're getting lower, and lower. Shockingly, as that wall gets longer, the crossings get less. Remember the Democrats? ""You don't need a wall. You don't need a wall. You don't need it."" Seven years they all voted for it, they just didn't have the ability to build it. You know it's not easy with land, and this, and that, and property, and rights. They couldn't figure it out but I can figure it out. The problem was we couldn't get the money, but we got all the money we need now. We have everything. We have everything. The last time, this last budget, they didn't really fight us on the wall. You know why? Because they learned it's a really bad issue for them. It's a really bad issue. But I made one mistake with the wall. I should have said, ""We will never ever build a wall."" They would have given me so much money to build a wall. That was my only … Because I used to go, ""We will build the wall,"" right? That was a mistake. I should have said, ""We will never ever build it. Under no circumstances,"" and they would have forced its building and I would have said, ""Okay."" By the way, in all due respect, you know who's going to pay for the wall, right? No, no, they play … The fake news plays. No, no, through remittance illegal aliens from Mexico are going to pay for the call. That's what it is. Remittance. 100% because when I say something I mean it. I said I was going to build a wall. You think it's easy when you have a party that controls the House, you got to end that. You got to end that. They said they picked up the House in '18 but I didn't run in '18. You know the big difference when you run, '16 I ran, '18 I didn't run. They did, they picked up some seats. I didn't run, but I'm running this time and we've got to take back the House. Kevin McCarthy will be a great Speaker of the House. Kevin McCarthy will be a great Speaker, watch. But getting something built when you have a party that controls one of the three, getting it built is … Honestly I don't want to brag, nobody else could have done it. Nobody else could have done it. It's The Real Deal wall. It's the wall that border security wanted. Remember I thought I could just build concrete slabs? They didn't want that because you have to be able to see through. I said, ""Oh come on."" This is the expensive version. This is the best version. This is steel, and concrete, and rebar in between. It's really something. Did you see the other day where drug dealers got caught at the top? They couldn't get over. We had to get the fire department to get them down. They couldn't get over and they're like mountain climbers. They got used to climbing. They got caught because you know that panel? That's an anti-climb panel. It's very hot and very tough. It's a very hard panel to climb, the panel on top. Sometimes I'd say, ""I'd rather do without that panel,"" because I'm a very visual person. They said, ""Sir that's anti-climb panel."" I said, ""Oh it is? Okay, let's put it on. To hell with it."" It's true. Anti-climb panel. The wall is the top of the line. That's what they wanted. Mostly 30 feet tall. That's very tall. That's maximum. It's really doing a big trick. A lot … Wherever we have it … 100 miles is all of a sudden a lot, but where you have that it's incredible. 99.9%, especially when we're watching it. We're watching the sections. Illegal crossings now are down 75% since last spring. The powerful border wall was starting to set. I mean pretty soon we'll be setting records in speed. It's going up very rapidly. Very rapidly. You're seeing it all over and it's going to be really something. Look, it would be nice if we didn't have to have it. It would be great, but we have to have it. They said, ""Oh we could have drones."" Oh what are you going to do with drones flying around? When people are going through your border with nowhere … They're going to have drones flying around. They know because they were all for it. They were all for it. Now all of a sudden they're against, but they want drones. Well we're going to have drones too but the drones are policing the wall. In terms of human trafficking, people don't even talk about it. Because of the internet, sadly, the worst in the history of our world. All over the world. Trafficking in women and children all over the world. All over the world. The worst it's ever been, but when we have this border it makes it very, very tough for them to come into the United States with women and with children stuffed in trunks in the back of a car. The Washington Democrats have never been more extreme. 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders' government healthcare takeover bill. It's a takeover of your healthcare that would strip all of those 180,000 million great Americans of your private coverage. You want that. You got great deals. You're able to negotiate, you're able to keep your doctor, keep your area, keep your hospitals, keep everything that you wanted. Now they want to take it away. Report to an operating room when you have a cold, okay? In your local hospital. I don't think so. 180,000 million people, but I'm not going to knock it because I want Bernie to bring it right up to the end and we'll debate it the day before the election. Okay? We are saving your healthcare while Socialist Democrats are trying to take away your healthcare. Sleepy Joe has no idea what he's even … He doesn't even know what he's talking about. He's so lost. Honestly, that poor guys is so lost. They talk healthcare, she said, ""It's over for him."" It was over for him, actually if you knew him, a long time ago. Now it's really over. We are making healthcare better and cheaper. We got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing, which essentially killed Obamacare. We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will, the Republican party. We're stopping surprise medical billing and making everything totally transparent. I signed it already. Everything now is going to transparencies, where hospitals, doctors, everybody has to tell you how much things are costing. Watch those prices come down. Right? Right? I have an expert on healthcare. He said transparency because it's a big deal. It's a big deal. Nobody else would have gotten it done, that I can tell you. Transparency is bigger than healthcare because you will see prices tumbling like you wouldn't believe. People go in for a blood test, they get charged $2,700. Down the road they get the same test for $57. The same exact test. Maybe it's better. Maybe it's better. It's crazy. When you have transparency it's all going to come. You watch. You watch. But this person, a real expert, said, ""This is bigger than healthcare,"" and I got it done. Unfortunately it won't really start kicking in until after the election because it takes a period of time. They have certain statutory requirements, et cetera. Well you better let me win. Can you imagine? Can you imagine? I did transparency, I took the guts, I did transparency and then I'm going to watch as somebody else says, ""Didn't he do a great job for transparency?"" You better let me win because I want the credit for that one. We're buying cheaper drugs from other countries and approving more generic drugs than ever, ever, ever before. We are defending your right to keep the doctor. We are defending your right to keep your plan. Remember Obama 28 times, ""You can keep your doctor. You can keep your doctor""? 28. ""You can also keep your plan. You can keep it. You can keep it."" 28 times he lied. We should impeach him. No, he got it on a lie. He got it on a lie, but we've run it much better. But essentially it's totally different because of individual mandate. Because that really took the guts out of it and we're running it much better. I had a choice, do we run it well or do we run it poorly? If we run it poorly everyone's going to blame me. If we run it well everyone's going to give him credit, especially the fakers back there right? But you know what? We got to run it well but we're coming up with a healthcare that if we win the House we will have the best healthcare of any country in the world, by far. We're fighting the lobbyists and we're fighting the special interest, in case you didn't notice. We are serving only you. Thanks to our bold reforms we're now offering health plans that are 60% cheaper than Obamacare. We're offering a lot of different things. We have just passed, recently, 10 months ago, Right to Try. I love Right to Try. You know what that is? That's people are terminally ill and they can't use medicine because … They've been trying to pass this, almost for 50 years. You can't use the medicine. We have the greatest doctors, labs, hospitals in the world. They come up with a medicine but it has to go through the FDA procedure, right? You can't do anything. You can't use it. They won't let you use it. Now I have you sign an agreement, you're not going to sue the United States, you're not going to this, your family, et cetera, et cetera. Very simple. And they can use it. You have no idea the results that are taking place. You have no idea. You have no idea the results. People's lives are being … For me it was simple. I said, ""Wait a minute, you're worried about hurting somebody? These people are dying. They're terminally ill. They're admitting they're terminally ill and you won't let them use a drug that may work? Let the use the drug."" And we're letting them use the drug and it's working in a lot of cases. We have transformed veterans healthcare, including VA Choice. The best. You know I think I'm a totally brilliant human being. I think I'm the smartest person, so I came up with a plan. I'll never forget, I was in New Hampshire, I came up with this idea because everybody kept coming up to me and saying, ""Sir it's really terrible what's happening with healthcare. We're waiting in line for two weeks, for four weeks, for seven weeks."" Honestly people were waiting in line, they weren't very sick, they were terminally ill, truthfully, before they saw a doctor. By the time they got to the doctor. So I came up with this incredible plan. Only I could think of this. I said, ""Here's what you do … Here's what you do, if somebody can't get a doctor quickly,"" because we have great doctors at the VA. They don't get enough credit. ""If you can't get to a doctor quickly you go outside, you go locally, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get yourself all better."" Right? So I went back. I went back and I told my people, ""Do you have any idea how smart I am? Listen to this plan I have."" They said, ""Actually sir we've known about that plan for 52 years we just couldn't get it approved."" So I said, ""Oh that's too bad, I thought it was brilliant,"" but what I am good at is getting things approved and I got it approved. People are using it and it's great. I know the people of Iowa don't care about this but we are making substantial investments in rural healthcare. We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. That's a great thing. Our great first lady is helping us with that. That is such a big thing for Melania. Big, big thing. She is really involved. We will never let the Democrats give away your healthcare to illegal immigrants, especially when we say, ""Come in. Come in, we'll give you healthcare."" It's one thing they come in and it's a rough situation because we all have hearts but when people are saying, like in California this wacky governor he says, ""Come in, we're going to give you healthcare. We're going to give you free education. We're going to give you everything. We're going to give you a beautiful Rolls-Royce."" See to show you how fake they are one of the newscasters said, ""Donald Trump said that the governor of California promised a Rolls-Royce to illegal immigrants. He didn't promise them. This was a lie and a misrepresentation by President Trump."" They can't take a little humor. They can't take it. These people are sick. They're sick. No. They're sick people. Them and Shifty Schiff is a very sick person. He lies awake at night shifting and turning, Shifty. Shifting and turning in his bed, sweating like a dog. ""How am I going to get him? He didn't do anything wrong, how am I going to get him?"" Oh what a sick guy he is. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion. Ripping babies straight from the mother's womb. Right up until the moment of birth. That is why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, Socialism, and blatant corruption. No matter how you cut it, that's what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. You know that, right? Abraham Lincoln. Honest Abe. Remember I always said, ""I can be more presidential than any other past president, other than perhaps Abraham Lincoln when he's wearing the hat,"" right? Because it's easy to be presidential but only have about three people in front of me. Be a, ""Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Is everything okay in Iowa? Oh I see, the world is ripping you off. Well there's not a thing I can do about that. Thank you. Good night everybody. Good night."" No, we got to do it the right way. Republicans … And by the way, can I be honest? Doing this takes far more talent than doing that. Doing that is very easy. This is not easy. Especially when you just left Michigan, and you just left other places, and you got maniacs doing a number on you all the time for three years. You got the maniacs for three years. I think before I came down the escalator with our future first lady I think really they were doing it then. They started even before I came down on the escalator. These people are maniacs, so you have all that. So you're fighting that and you're doing farm bills. We got your farm bill approved by the way. We got your farm bill approved. I don't even mention that because that's massive by any other standard, but it's peanuts compared to the USMCA and the China deal, right? So I don't even mention it. Anyway, Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed. It's true. Our numbers with African American workers, people, are through the roof. Are through the roof because … Remember I used to say, ""What do you have to lose?"" I'd read the down the worst on crime, the worst on education. They got this, they got that, they got 10 different things, all horrible. One day I'm in front of this tremendous group of people and I'm reading this list, African American, they have the highest crime rate, they have the highest this, they have the worst education, they have the worst schools, they have the worst … I said, ""Stay with me,"" because they were with the Democrats for a hundred years, more. I said, ""Stay with me. What the hell do you have to lose?"" You know what? You know what? Remember that? Now they have the best employment and unemployment numbers, they have the best poverty numbers, they have numbers that nobody would believe. They're doing so great. It's so great to see it. It's incredible. Youth unemployment, African American youth. It's been great. We're asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are a big tent and a big party with big, bold, beautiful ideas for the future. We're what the country was based on originally. It was called greatness. It was called greatness. During National School Choice Week, School Choice everybody, we continue our fight to rescue children trapped in failing government schools. Iowa became one of the first states to pass School Choice. That was over 10 years ago. Now Governor Reynolds, Senator Ernst, Senator Grassley, and more than 100 members of Congress are supporting our plan to give School Choice to every child in America who needs it. It's a great plan. To give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed criminal justice reform. Think of that. Think of that. We had a lot of great Conservatives who wanted it, we had Liberals who wanted it. They couldn't get it passed. President Obama couldn't even come close. He didn't try too hard. He talked like, ""Oh I'll try."" To uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 federal judges, a record, who will interpret The Constitution as one. And two great Supreme Court justices, by the way. As part as … Right? Two great ones. As part of my commitment to rebuild our military we secured an $8.5 million facility to support our Iowa Guardsmen at Camp Dodge, right here in Des Moines, Iowa. Right here, Camp Dodge. Camp Dodge everybody. We take care of Camp Dodge. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Yesterday we just released a historic new plan for peace. We're going to see if we can get that done. It's one of the toughest deals of all. One of the toughest deals but we have a shot at it. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for our country. They apologized. They would say, ""I'm sorry."" Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Iowa. We are standing up for Iowa. At stake in our present battle is the survival, frankly, of our nation. Look, I can make this speech really short. All I have to do is say, ""Hello Iowa, you have no choice. You have to vote for me. Otherwise everything that you've built in your entire life will be gone. Goodbye Iowa, have a good time."" Instead I work my ass off up here, okay? Yeah. True. Do you think this is easy? It's a little hot in this room. This room wasn't designed for this many people. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020. We have to. By the way, for those beautiful farmers that want to leave your small farms or businesses to your children … Because of our great tax bill, the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, the biggest that you benefit by. Because of that there is no death tax or inheritance tax, as they call it. So I always say, ""If you love your children that's a great thing. If you don't love your children don't leave it to them and that particular tax won't matter,"" but if you love … Is there anybody here that does not love your children? Is there anybody here who loves your children? Well it's Iowa. It's Iowa. You love your children. You know you have no tax to pay, you leave your ... No, it's great. So when you're looking down at your children you're saying, ""Oh did you get lucky? Did you get lucky? Look at them, they're enjoying life."" But only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. That swamp is bad. That swamp is bad. I had no idea it was going to be this sick and this degenerated. It's a degenerate swamp. I had no idea. When I came out, I said, ""We're going to drain this swamp."" I had no idea that the swamp was that evil, but we're winning. We're winning because we're in The White House. We're winning. With your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependents to independents, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening all over our country. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. It's already happening. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products made, raised, farmed, and grown right here in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine. Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. We've already started. Should have been started in the last administration. Incredible. Should have been started earlier, but we started. In less than 10 years, the AIDS epidemic will be eradicated, will be gone. Who would have thought that was possible? When they came in and told me that a couple of years ago, I said, ""Really? Nobody knows that."" Incredible the strides that we've made. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. In the state of Virginia they want to take your guns away, you believe it? Virginia, I love Virginia. Of all states, they want to take your guns away. The Democrats. Not going to happen. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We are one great America. We support, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that family and faith, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way, not government bureaucracy. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust. We live by those words, in God we trust. From Cambridge, good old Cambridge. Who's from Cambridge here please? Cambridge. What the hell do I mention it for when there's two people here? Can I say it anyway? I'll say it anyway. Good place Cambridge. Good, he said it's amazing. Well, from Cambridge to Council Bluffs, from Cedar Rapids where I made my last speech prior to the election. What a place, 32,000 people. I said, ""I'm going to win tomorrow."" To Rock Rapids, from Melbourne to Moorhead, and from Davenport to right here in Des Moines, Iowa. We stand on the shoulders of true red blooded American heroes. This great state was founded by tough, tough, tough frontier men. These are tough people. Let's see how big and how tough. They're tough. Anybody like to join ICE? You want to join ICE? He says, ""No thank you."" And strong pioneer women who defied the dangers to carve out a life and a beautiful home with great families and great neighbors. They tamed the wilderness, braved the elements, tilled the soil, planted the fields and help make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped to build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, where it has always belonged. It's coming back to you, you see that. With your help, your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working and we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen, and especially the great ladies and gentlemen of Iowa, the best is yet to come. True, true. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you. Thank you."
Trump,"What a crowd, what a crowd. Get those people over here. See me. Let them come over. What is a big crowd, it's always big. We want to win. We got to win. We want to save our country from the radical left, the radical left crazies. Thank you very much. And hello, North Carolina, hello, North Carolina. We love you, North Carolina. I'm thrilled to be in Fayetteville with thousands of loyal, hard working American patriots. And you know what's going to happen in 45 days from now, and you're watching those polls. They go up, up, up up. 45 days from now, we're going to win North Carolina. We're going to win four more years in the White House. As we meet tonight, our nation mourns the loss of a legal giant Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her landmark rulings, fierce devotion to justice and her courageous battle against cancer inspire all Americans. You may agree. You may not disagree with her, but she was an inspiration to a tremendous number of people. I say, all Americans Justice Ginsburg's close relationship with a friend of ours, a friend of mine, Justice Scalia, is also a powerful reminder that we can disagree on fundamental issues while treating each other with decency, dignity, and respect. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family. Thank you very much. So Article II of our constitution says the president shall nominate justices of the Supreme Court. I don't think it can be any more clear, can it? I don't think so. I don't think so. What do you think, Thom? Thom Tillis, I don't think it can be any more clear. This can only happen in North Carolina. I hope you hear that back home. Look at all that press. That's a lot of press. That's a lot of fake news. Well, I hope they hear. So the chant, this is a new one. Fill that seat. This is the chant. This can only happen to me. Fill that seat. Now it says the president is supposed to fill the seat, right? And that's what we're going to do. We're going to fill the seat. With a great hat. I want to try one of those hats. I love that. No, think of it. 29 times, every single time nobody said, ""Oh, let's not fill the seat."" We won the election. Now then we have some senators that, forget it. Think of it, I won't say it. I won't say it, Susan. I won't say it, Susan. But Thom Tillis is with us. I can tell you that. Great. We have great Republican senators. We have great people and we have a great country. That's really, we have a great country. And we're going to keep it that way. So we win an election and those are the consequences. It's called fill that seat and that's what we're doing. The Supreme Court was a very central issue in both the 2016 presidential election and then the 2018 midterm elections where, by the way, I didn't run. We had a lot of people, a lot of people said, ""Oh, he really took a little bit of a shellacking."" Not nearly as bad as others. In fact, we gained seats in the Senate, but they never talk about that. They don't talk about that. We gained two seats. Nobody talked about it. But we didn't run. And I had a lot of people that, ""Sir, we'll never vote in 2018."" I said, ""No, no vote, everybody vote. They just didn't. I think we were like 9 million people decided they wanted to wait and they've waited and you see what's going on. You see what's happening. You see the enthusiasm that we have. Which, by the way, we set a record in 2016. The bad news for the Democrats is we are more enthusiastic now. Not even close, than we were in 2016. We are getting crowds and this is pandemic and we're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner of the pandemic. But we're having them outside. And we shouldn't say this is some kind of a rally from now on. It's called a protest. We are protesters. We're going to call on our rallies that because you see a lot of these, let's call them blue states, we want to be nice. We're going to call it a protest against stupidity. So we are going to have protests against stupidity. And Pennsylvania. Look what they're doing in Pennsylvania. A great state, that's actually something very special is going to happen here, in Pennsylvania. That's a commonwealth. We always have to remember Pennsylvania, commonwealth. Got two of them and you better remember you get in trouble. But we love Pennsylvania. And it's a shut down. The governor's got it just shut down nice and tight. And you know what? On November 4th, it's going to be opened up. Because they're trying to hurt our numbers. But our economic numbers are so good. They're staggering. They're the best we've ever had. Jobs, retail, stock, market, everything. And this is with a lot of shutdowns by Democrats. That's all they're doing. On November 4th, they'll announce, ""We've decided to open up."" One of the teachers groups said, actually, one of the unions and one of the politicians in California said, ""No, we're not going to do it. We need to do it. We should be open by November 4th."" That was not a good thing for them to say. That person I think was fired, I think was fired. In both the 2016 and the 2018 elections, the American people chose a president and a Senate majority united in their commitment to selecting nominees who believe in applying the Constitution as written. Both the White House and the Senate majority have a moral duty to fulfill the promises they made to the voters. And that is exactly what we're going to do. We said that if for any reason, we have a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court, we will fill that vacancy. We're not going to say, and by the way, we have plenty of time. There's a lot of time. You're talking about January 20th. So we will uphold equal justice under the law for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. I won't be putting forth a nominee next week. It will be a woman. It will be a woman unless, wait, okay, let's do a poll. Oh, there they are. How many of these have you come to? Speaking of women, how many of, what is this number one? Like 90, they're great. North Carolina, though. I see them all over the place, they're great. Anyway, I hope your husbands are okay with it. Are they okay? They're okay. You have good husbands. But we're going to do a vote. So I said, I love these free polls because pollsters and most of the pollsters are corrupt as far as I'm concerned. If we believed in pollsters we wouldn't be here right now. But we're actually getting very good. We just had a 53 from Rasmussen, which is very good. Considering we won four years ago with a lot lower than 53. History has shown that when you're at 53 you can't lose an election. Has anyone ever lost an election with a 53? The answer is yes, when the other side cheats. That could happen, that could happen. That could happen. You saw what happened in Pennsylvania. Some state supreme court justice just ruled that they can take as long as they want to count the ballots. That means I'll be leading and winning Pennsylvania like we did last time. Yeah, yeah. We'll be leading, we'll be winning Pennsylvania. We're going to win it easy. We're going to win your state easily. And Deb, what a great, she's doing such a good job. But Mark, just a few months ago, I've been trying to get him for three years to leave and we have a great person running as you know. Really, I mean really great. Does everyone know Madison? Yes? You're going to vote for Madison? He's great. He's a great guy. But Mark had a beautiful head of black hair and I just noticed that hair's turning white very fast. But we're doing a job. We're very close to a great deal with TikTok, TikTok but nobody cares about that anymore. All they care about is fill that seat, right? Until about 24 hours ago, that's all they talked about is TikTok, TikTok. We have a deal worked out, I think with Walmart is going to buy it along with Oracle. Larry Ellison, it's going to be an incredible combination. And I said, ""Do me a favor. Could you put up $5 billion into a fund for education so we can educate people as to real history of our country, the real history, not the fake history."" Because we're getting very close to that deal. And all of the technology will be maintained here. They're going to move probably to the great state of Texas. Sorry, we got you a lot of business when it came… but they're going to move into the United States, which is what's important. They're moving to the United States, unbelievable company. They're going to have 25,000 jobs. If it all goes, I gave them the preliminary approval. But they're putting up $5 billion. And my only problem is they did it so fast. I should have asked for more. What happened is when I suggested they should put up a lot of money everybody said, senators, congressmen, women, everybody. They said, ""You can't do that. That's never been done."" That's the problem, nothing's ever been done. And we had other companies, a lot of people wanted it. And I said, ""You got to put up $5 million either to the Treasury of the United States maybe or into some education fund or do something."" And they were sort of agreeing with me. They thought it was okay. And then I went to the legal legals here and I said, ""They're going to put up $5 million, give it to the United States."" ""Sir.,You can't do that. There's no provision."" I said, ""How the hell can there be no provision. We're making the deal possible. Why can't they give us $5 billion dollars?"" That's b, that's a lot of money. Now, watch the crazy Democrats. They'll go, ""They should have gotten more money."" It's never been done before. They should have, no matter what you do. They should have gotten more. Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, crazy Nancy. But I'll tell you. And I said it last night, we had a great rally. Last night, you saw that in a place that we're going to win. We're going to win Minnesota. Hasn't been won since 1972. And they're all saying, ""Well, we did give them back the big iron ore range."" It was, Obama took it away with the stroke of a pen. He put everybody out of work. We gave it back. But I'll tell you what, we're going to have a victory on November 3rd, the likes of which you've never seen. Now we're counting on the federal court system to make it so that we can actually have an evening where we know who wins. Not where the votes are going to be counted a week later or two weeks later. But in just three and a half years under my administration, we've secured America's borders rebuilt the awesome power of the U.S military, think of that. And I shouldn't say this and the fake news keeps going, ""Oh, he's given away classified information."" No I'm not. We are building and we have built weapons the likes of which this world has never seen before. And I said that a week ago and it was a headline and one of these fake newspapers where, ""He's giving away confidential information,"" these people are crazy. No, no. I'm just telling you that- Crazy. No, no. I'm just telling you that President Putin and President Xi of China, Russia, China, North Korea, everybody. They are so envious of what we're doing. They can't even believe it. If they know, they perhaps don't know. Under Obama, they knew immediately, okay. Under us, but we are building weapons, all made in the USA. The likes of which no country has ever seen before. And hope to God, we never have to use them. That's the key, I don't ever want to use them. Remember, I was supposed to be a guy that was going to get us into a war in the first week. Remember that? Where's the war? We're taking them out of Afghanistan. We're almost finished with that. Working along well. We're taking them out of Syria, other than I left some behind for the oil, we kept the oil, is it okay that we kept the oil? Is it okay we kept the oil? Let's go back to my poll. Ready? So we're putting, I think it should be a woman, because I actually like women much more than I like men, I have to say. No, I do. I do, I like women more. So I have to make a decision, to fill the seat, as we say, we should have a new campaign. Let's make a t-shirt, fill the seat. Okay? My people are so good, tomorrow, it'll be all over the place. That's a good idea. That's a good idea. Fill the seat. Okay watch this, so good tomorrow you'll see them all over the place, fill the seat. I don't know how the hell they do it, but they get it done fast. You remember I said, where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? The next day, it was like one of the biggest selling t- shirts where is Hunter? What the hell ever happened? He took the money and he ran I think. Where's Hunter? He took the money, he went to China, he took 1.5 billion. He had no experience. He didn't have a job until this guy became vice president. Then he went to China, he got $1.5 billion. I asked the head of a great company, Blackstone. One of the biggest in the world. I said, ""Steve, let me ask you a question. Is that possible?"" ""No, that's never done."" China doesn't do that. Well, how did a guy with no experience do this? He said, ""Very simple. His father's vice president."" Is that what you want? And then Ukraine, $183,000 a month, and a $3 million upfront payment for him and his friends, think of this, with no experience and no job, and they said, do you know energy? It's an energy company that paid it. Do you know energy? No, I don't. I've not familiar with the subject. Our great Congressman. Right? How the hell does this happen? I think it will be brought up into debate. I think it will be brought up in the debate, I think. Where is Hunter? Where is Hunter? You know where Hunter is? He's probably on the Riviera having a very good time. He's giving some great energy advice. He's learning. He's taking a night class on energy for 180 grand. Where is Hunter? They're corrupt. Remember Joe with a prosecutor? $ 1 billion, I'm not giving it to them until they get those prosecutors away from my son or whatever the hell he said, that crazy company over in Ukraine. $1 billion. I'm not giving it. You get them out. And guess what? They got them out. Here's your billion dollars. Now that's called quid pro quo. Right? That's the real deal. With us, there was none. They made it up. Remember when Shift made the phony speech? Eight times he said the same thing, except that's not what happened. Fortunately, we had those wonderful people that write every perfect word, every word. I'm glad we had them because we're dealing with a bunch of thieving bad people. So women and men, ready? Would you rather have a woman on the Supreme Court or would you rather have a man? Ready? A woman or a man. So, would you rather have me choose, this is a very scientific poll. Actually, it's a lot more accurate than these polls that interview like 97 people have been interviewed, then they charge you a million dollars and they probably don't interview the people. They sit behind their desk. Would you rather have a woman on the Supreme Court? Yes, woman. Yes? Tom tiller says yes. Or would you rather have a man on the Supreme Court? What's going on? Let's give it one more quick chance. This is a free poll. And this is a lot of people. This is tens of thousands of people. This is a lot of people. You know, the fake news, they'll say, ""He had a smattering of people."" If Bernie Sanders had a crowd. Oh, he had a massive crowd. It was so big. With me, my crowds are five times bigger than Bernie's. And they'll say, ""He had a smattering of people."" They were in the middle of an airport that nobody ever heard of. Thousands. If those people, come on, bring them over. What the hell, at this point, might as well, let them come on over. Come on over. You got thousands of people behind these people. I would imagine the sight lines aren't too good. You have stands in front. Okay. So one more time. Who would rather have a man on the Supreme Court? Who would have a woman on the Supreme. Now tomorrow, like fake news, CNN, he was playing games with the United States. It is a terrible thing he's done. No, I'm just taking a poll, please. And by the way, that's a very accurate poll, because that's the way I feel. It will be a woman, a very talented, very brilliant woman. Who I haven't chosen yet, but we have numerous women on the list. I built this incredible list of brilliant people. And we're asking for Biden's list. He can't give it. You know why? Because if he ever gave a list, he'd either put somebody in the left middle, which would be okay. You could get votes, or he'd put one, somebody, which is what he's going to choose, so far left, now, if he did the left middle, he loses his entire left coast. Right? And if he loses the left coast, that's the end of his election. And last time, remember how many people I got from Bernie, because of trade. A lot of the Bernie people vote for us because Bernie is right about one thing, trade. But Bernie took a bad defeat, didn't he? It was a bad loss. He's one of the most gracious losers I've ever seen, he is. All Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas had to do is leave. If she left before Super Tuesday, Bernie would have won every one of those States, but they split up that vote. That's too bad, but we have Sleepy Joe, we'll see how that works out. I think it's working out pretty good. We were winning so much, we didn't even have, we could have called off the election. We were winning by so much, and then the plane came in from China. And in many ways, I had to go back to work, but I had to go back to work on this one too. And now we're going up and up and up and we're winning and we're winning all over the place. Because I happen to think, I just say what I want. And you know, they make up a lot of false stories. They will make up a lie. Like what I said about military. Can you imagine? No animal would say that. They make it up and then they put it in ads. So once they did that, the only good thing is I can say, I said, ""Now I can say anything."" He is the worst candidate, the dumbest of all candidates, but he was dumb in prime time, as told to me by a Senator from long ago, he said, ""Who's the dumbest in the Senate, who's the smartest in the Senate?"" The smartest is, I won't tell you. But the dumbest is Joe. I said, ""Who's Joe."" He said, ""Joe Biden."" That was 25 years ago. That was in prime time. He is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. If I lose to him, I don't know what I'm going to do. I will never speak to you again. You'll never see me again. No, how do you lose? He is honestly, I go up and these guys are grilling me all the time. Stephanopoulos grill, grill. Okay. It's all right. It's okay. I think it came out very, well it's always, it comes out well. You have to be able to answer. They're very weak compared to some of the foreign people that we deal with from foreign countries, leaders of foreign countries. But I say he's always using a teleprompter. I don't care if he uses a teleprompter, you know what bothers me? That means the fake news is giving him the questions. So that's what really… they never gave me the questions. If I ever said, in fact, I'm going to say it now. I want from now on you to give me the questions before you ask me. And I'm going to read the questions off the teleprompter, and the questions are so easy. Did you see Anderson Cooper? He's a nice guy. He's interviewed me over the years, a lot, but he's a tough interviewer. Did you see those softballs? What do you think Donald Trump is a very bad human being. Do you agree with that? Yes, I do, Anderson. I've never seen softballs, and actually they're getting hit by it. They're getting hit by it. It's just a terrible thing. I mean, this is a guy, I used to call him 1% Joe, because he ran numerous times and he could only get 1%. In fact, he actually had 1% with an arrow pointing left. That means less than one. Now he's shot, he's got half of his head left, and he's out, think of it. He's totally shot. And he ends up getting the nomination. He couldn't get it in prime time. What the hell is going on with the world today? What's going on? What's going on with the world, Mark Meadows? Unbelievable Meadows, oh boy. He's a smart guy, Meadows, great, great guy, North Carolina, in just three and a half years, we obliterated the ISIS caliphate. Remember when I had it down to 99%, they said, ""You got to finish it."" I said, ""Let somebody else finish it."" And we went, and we finished it. We fixed our disastrous trade deals, which we have. China's now paying us billions and billions of dollars. But you know, I view it differently now, I view China much differently now, after the plague came in, I view it differently. And we brought your jobs back home to North Carolina and our contract. In three years of President Trump, real median household income rose by almost $7,000. Now think of that, three years, three years, right? Achieving the highest median income in the history of our country. This is in three years. Under 16 years of presidents, Barack Hussein Obama, ladies and gentlemen, is President Barack Hussein Obama, or as Rush Limbaugh, the great, how great is Rush? Do we love Rush? As Rush Limbaugh would say, Barack Hussein Obama. You ever hear Rush? Barack Hussein Obama. Rush is great. He's doing well too. He's great. He's a tough guy. We love Rush. We love you Rush. He watches every one of these rallies. You know, he supported me when I came down with our great first lady, I came down the escalator. I made a speech. I didn't even have a speech writer, I had to wing it. The winging speeches are the best ones like last night. But Rush said, ""I like that guy. I'd never heard that before. I'd never heard we're going to build a wall."" We're going to have secure borders. We're going to make new trade deals that are like sane. We're going to do all the things we're going to rebuild our military. We're going to have a strong country again. We did so many things, and Rush heard this. I didn't know Rush. I mean, maybe I met him once, twice, for two seconds. And he became an instant fan of Trump. And he was for a long time before I even got to know him. And he's been so important, he's the King, 39 million listeners. There's nobody like him. Try sitting down for what is it? Three hours? And talking, just talking with everyone. 39 million people, often. Try sitting. We love Rush. I love Rush. But listen, try sitting down with a radio show with millions and millions of people listening, and talk for three hours without phone calls. Phone calls are easy. Hey, what do you think of this? What do you think. Just talk. Talk. And everybody finds it fascinating. And it is fascinating. I wish I had time to listen more often. It's a little tough as president, but everybody finds it fascinating. And we gave Rush, because he's such an important person and done such an incredible job the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And Catherine, his wife is great. What a couple. But Rush has been unbelievable. He's so on our side. And he was from literally day one, right from the beginning. And we don't have to mention Sean, and Laura, and so many others. We don't have to mention Lou, the great Lou Dobbs, right? I mean, Lou Dobbs said, Lou started years ago, and he liked us from the beginning. He said, ""Donald Trump is going to be a very good president."" Okay. That was the first little time. Then he went, ""Donald Trump. I love Donald Trump, but he's the best since Ronald Reagan."" Then he went, ""Donald Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan."" So that was about a year and a half into it. Then the great Lou Dobbs said, ""Donald Trump may be the greatest of all time. Greatest of all time."" And then somebody said, ""Can I ask you Lou, when you say the greatest, does that include Abraham Lincoln and George Washington?"" He said, ""Absolutely. He's now the greatest of all time."" So we love Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs is great. Go out and buy his book. His book is great. But we have great support. We have great support. Tucker's been very good lately, I have to tell you. Tucker has been very good. Tucker Carlson, he's come a long way, actually the whole thing with faking around with our whole history. He's very strong in that, we took care of that very powerfully, very powerfully. We signed an executive order. We fired a lot of people that were talking about cancel culture and a lot of fake stuff, that were getting paid a lot of money that we're here for a long time. Under 16 years of presidents Obama and Bush, the median income only rose $2,900. Now think of that. So three years, it went up $7,000, 16 years, it went up less than $3,000. I'd say that's a big difference. And that's not including energy, because look what you're paying for your gasoline now. Right? Remember those days? Remember those days of $5, you said, ""Let's get rid of that big truck."" Now you're all buying bigger trucks than they ever thought possible. You know why? Because gasoline is so damn cheap, right? Remember the $5 days? Now you're below $2 a lot, right? Below two. I mean, they're seeing numbers that nobody believes. It's all good stuff. And we're energy independent. So many things have happened. If you add four or $5,000, so you're talking about by $11,000, you got to add the energy. I said to my people, ""Put the energy in."" ""Well, I don't know if it's right."" I said, ""Do me a favor, just put it in."" In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any president in American history. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we're doing it again, and we're doing it very rapidly. This is a super V. They said, ""Oh, I don't know, V is going to be very hard."" No, this is a super V. We will deliver a safe and effective vaccine this year. It's already in very good shape. Very, very good shape. In a matter of weeks. We will end the pandemic from China. We will end our plague from China. Next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country, it's heading that way. If you take a look, automobile manufacturing, housing, retailing, they're all setting records, they're through the roof, hard to believe, actually, during the rounding the corner, when I say rounding the corner, they go crazy. They want to keep it going as long as possible. If you say anything positive, they say, ""He's not telling the truth to the American public."" I am actually telling the truth. You know these people, they talked about, because I said, ""Well, Winston Churchill was a great leader."" They said the other night, ""You said Winston Churchill was a great leader, but he didn't lie."" Because this guy, Woodward. He writes a book. He's had it. He's another one shot. I compare him sort of to Biden. He's sharper than Biden, I have to say that, but he's shot. He's tired. He's exhausted. I never saw a guy be able to do so much television, try doing a book on somebody else. See how much television time they give you, like none. But they said the other night, and it was amazing. Winston Churchill. They said, ""He didn't lie to the people, to Britain. He didn't lie."" I said, ""Well, let me ask you this. He stood on buildings when the Nazis, Hitler, were bombing London."" That's pretty brave, because he may have been doing a little drinking, but he was known for that, right? He's got a right to, but it's true. He stood in the buildings in London, as they were bombing London, and made speeches, and made statements, and had everything. And he'd sometimes have press conferences. And the fake news wouldn't show up. He was standing there, nobody was in front of him. But he would stand there, and he would say, ""You are safe. You are safe. Everything is okay. You are safe."" Well, that's a lie, I guess, right? So I said, ""Oh, I never thought of it that way. I guess he lied."" No, he's a great leader, and he was leading, and he was a great, great prime minister. He did a fantastic job. Not lying. No. We love our country, we want to lead our country, and we can't let a thing like this, this is a horrible, horrible thing that happened to the world it happened, should have been stopped in China. They stopped it from going into the rest of China, should have been stopped in China. To defeat the China virus, we launched the largest industrial mobilization since World War II. Somebody said, ""What grade would you give yourself?"" I said, ""A+."" But I would give myself a D, I would say I would give myself, and my whole group, because Mike Pence is great, Mike Pence really was. He worked so hard. And it's unfair, he worked so hard. The ventilators, the vaccines, the therapeutics now we have, look at what's happening. When somebody gets very sick, look how we bring them back so often, compared to what it was originally. I mean, the work that's been done, and wait until you see what happens over the next few weeks with what's going on. But the Democrats don't want the vaccine. They don't want it. At first, they wanted a vaccine, because they didn't think it could happen. Now that we have it, they're going like, ""Well, we don't want it."" It's the craziest thing. Think of it, you want to get a vaccine, and they're willing to hurt people, let people die for political reasons. Think of it. I think, honestly, I think it's a disgrace. But we surged rapid testing kits. We have more testing than all other, I mean, practically everybody. You look at number two is India. They have 1.5 billion people. We are up 50 million tests more than India. In fact, we're about to crack 100 million tests. And when you test, then you have, does this make sense? Then you have cases. So we do all this testing, and I come home and I turn on NBC News. It is so bad. I think NBC, that's not only MSDNC. I think NBC with Lester Holt. There's another beauty. Hi Lester. How do you feel big in second place Lester? He surged from first place to second place. But NBC News is so, I mean, it's just terrible. They use free airwaves, and then they give you fake news. Free airwaves. They should pay a lot of money for this. This is not right. NBC. It's owned by a company called Concast, C-O-N, Concast, they're con, they're con men. It's a disgrace. They spend fortunes on public relations and then I get up and make a speech like this with television blazing all over the world, I guess. Yeah, the world, it's all over the world. And I say Concast, and immediately, there goes their public, how's your public relations doing NBC? Not too good. But they're just… they don't tell the truth. Our country would be so much better off if we had honest media, really. Really would. And do you see what their approval rating has gone to? I think it's one of my greatest achievements. Hey look- It's a Saturday night. We have all night. This happened last night in Minnesota. I have these teleprompter people, they're great, they're genius. And I was about 45 minutes into the speech, and I realized I was only on line two. And he was like, ""What do I do?"" But we have more fun. Hey, you now have a president that doesn't have to use a teleprompter, isn't that nice? And I said last night, I said, and yeah, your friends were there. The Congressmen. By the way, is the media now, and I'm pretty sure it's getting close. I think they have a lower approval rating than Congress. Congratulations. No, but it's hard. When you're sitting there, you're in businesses, you're in construction, you drive trucks, you do a lot of things. You're in offices. You don't realize, because you don't know what's happening. I know exactly a true story. And then it's written to totally bend the truth, to make a good thing into a bad thing. Like, can you believe it, in one week they nominated me, not for one, but for two Nobel prizes. No, but think of it. No but think. And they didn't cover the story. Now Obama got his the first week. Very liberal group, and nobody knew what the hell he got it for, and he didn't know. Why did you get it? I don't know. Remember? I don't know. I have no idea. But you know, you have a president, you love your president, and your president gets honored, because I'm not being honored, you're being honored with the Nobel Peace Prize, for Israel, what we did with Israel. I went home and I said to the First Lady, ""Darling,"" she's very popular. She made a great speech, right? And Ivanka made a great speech, right? But I went home. I said, ""Darling, I have big news tonight. Let's turn on the television."" You know, we don't use wind. We use actually, we actually use petroleum. We use Petro. Because we like it to be on like a lot. We don't like to have lots of open gaps when the wind's not blowing. We can't watch President Trump. I go home. I say, ""First Lady, a great thing happened today. I was honored, Nobel Peace Prize, nominated. This is a big thing First Lady."" And then I went home two days later. I said, ""First Lady, you're not going to believe it. I was honored again. Nobel Prize, that's Kosovo."" Israel, Kosovo. I said, ""First Lady, this is great news. Let's turn on the television. This is going to be big. This is going to be big tonight. We just got honored, this is big."" Nobel Peace, can you imagine? You grow up in Brooklyn, Queens, and now you're getting the… ""First Lady, let's turn on the television. Let's turn onto that fake NBC news."" And I see we have a storm. ""Okay, First Lady, don't worry about it. The storm is big. We have it taken care of, FEMA's down there, Florida, Alabama, Georgia. We got FEMA down there. It's being taken care of. We always take care of it. We take good care of it."" Texas, Louisiana. We took good care of him two weeks ago. ""All right First Lady, don't worry about it. It's the next story, I'm sure, it's the Nobel Prize for peace."" We're stopping mass killings between Kosovo and Serbia. They've been killing each other for so many, they're going to stop killing. I said, fellas, let's get together. They'd been doing it for hundreds of years, frankly, under different names. I said, that's great. And with Israel, UAE and Bahrain signed a deal with Israel. Everybody said it couldn't be done. I said, ""All right, First Lady, that's the first story on NBC, but don't worry. That's a big story. The floods are big. I see it."" And then there was a second story about something. And then their third story is about something with me, I don't know, something bad they found out. Then there was a fourth and a fifth and a sixth. I said, ""First Lady, I'm a little embarrassed. I thought we'd do a little better."" And then they looked at the screen, and said, ""Good night."" And I wasn't covered. I got the Nobel Peace Prize nomination, a Peace Prize, Nobel nomination. And they didn't cover it. And then the following day I watched a certain show that does like us, and they said, ""Would you believe, that they covered, and they mentioned like five subjects that were nothing. That was 18 minutes. And the Peace Prize Nobel version, zero time for President Trump. Thank you very much fake news media, we appreciate it. And when Obama got it, here are the headlines. President Obama gets the Nobel Prize. We need an honest media. The free airwaves, they lie over the free airwaves. They use them and they lie. I don't know. We're going to have to look at it. They're a bunch of scoundrels. They hate it when I say it, but you know, honestly, they are the enemy of the people. When they lie, they are the enemy of the people. You are the enemy of the people. Oh, damn it. The red lights just went off. One, two, three, there's one back there, there's one back there, probably, oh it's OAN, thank you OAN. Every time I get on this subject, they cover me not because they want to, but we get great ratings. We get ratings. These little deals that we have here, come on in folks, come on in. Look at these people. But you know what? I'll tell you what, it's true. They cover it because… But anytime I start talking about the fake news media, you see them getting a little tentative. The camera starts to shake a little bit, and you know, there's another thing. Look at this crowd. It's as far as the eye can see, it's a big crowd, right? They never cover it. I said to my wife last night, we had this incredible crowd. A lot of people, thousands and thousands. I mean like 25, 30,000, many people outside couldn't get it. It was like a sea of people. My wife said, ""Was it a large crowd?"" I said, ""Did you watch?"" ""Yes. But they only show your face."" And I saw people they never show. And that includes Fox, which has changed a lot, changed a lot, sad. Somebody said, ""What's the biggest difference between 2016 and now?"" You know what I said, ""Fox."" Biggest difference. Biggest difference. I don't know what's going on with them. But we have some great ones too on Fox. We surged rapid testing kits to every nursing home in America. We learned a lot, through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate by 85% since April. Think of that? 85%. We've come up with things. They're waiting to see what's coming over the next few months in terms of therapeutics, which to me is even more important than the vaccine. You go into the hospital, you make people better. You give them a shot, you do a transfusion. You make people better. They walk out, that's to me even better, but ultimately long-term, those vaccines are going to be great, and they're really working out well and it's going to be really soon. The people in certain groups are trying to hold them up as long as possible, as long as possible. They're going to try and give Sleepy Joe the credit. He doesn't even know what a… It's possible. They're going to try and get Sleepy Joe the credit. He doesn't even know what a vaccine is. Europe is almost 30% higher excess mortality than the United States. Does anyone know that? they don't report that, right? Europe? Europe's had a hard time. I'm not looking to hurt them, but they have 30% higher. Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1.3 million jobs, and a wonderful place called North Carolina, right? When I banned travel from China in January, Sleepy Joe Biden called it, ""That's hysterical. That's xenophobic."" What does that mean? Tell me what xenophobic means, Sleepy Joe. Who said that? I mean, you're my friend. Who said it? All right, what a voice. Have you ever tried opera? What a voice, did everybody hear that? That's true. I wouldn't say it. She said, ""He has no idea where he is."" But I would never say it. I won't say it. I won't say it. I refuse this. No, but don't underestimate him. Look, he's been doing this for 47 years, and I got a debate coming up with this guy. No, it's true. You never know, you never know. They give him a big fat shot in the ass, and he comes out, and for two hours, he's better than ever before. Problem is what happens after the … No, we're going to ask for a drug test, we are. I'd like to have a drug test. Both of us. I'll take it, he'll take. Because I watched him into debates with all those people, those Democrats. The one who treated him worst was Kamala. Actually, also, she was the one that treated, you know that, she was the one that treated him so badly. And she treated Kavanaugh very badly too. Nobody was ever ruder, nobody ever suffered, like Justice Kavanaugh suffered in the hands and the mouths of those horrible people. The way he was tortured was disgraced. And they had nothing. Those women, that was all made up. Most of them have already admitted, it was all made up lies, false accusations, and they made him suffer. And the leader of the pack I would say was, Kamala was the worst, and Pocahontas was a close second. How's Pocahontas doing, since she destroyed Bloomberg? How about Bloomberg? Did he get killed? Now he's trying to come back. He's trying to buy his way back into the Democratic Party. ""I'm going to put up $100 million in Florida, we're going to go,"" he wants to be back so badly. Here's a guy who spent $2 billion, it's almost two billion now, they're finding out. He had some of the dumbest advisers, people I know, some of the dumbest people. If he would have just kept spending a couple of hundred million dollars a week on ads, he could have won. He could have won. Unfortunately, he said, ""No, I want to debate."" He went and sued to get into the debates. That was not a good lawsuit. They settled by saying, ""We'll let you in the debate."" The first question, he was destroyed. You would think that, the way the Democrats treated him, he would really come to me, and he'd say, ""I want you,"" but his hatred and jealousy … He wanted to be President, but he doesn't have the capability of being President. But he's going down now to Florida, he's going to spend $100 million. How good … I have to say this, I'm not a fan of Elizabeth Warren. I gave her the name Pocahontas, I thought that was the end. Remember what I used to say about her? She has … Oh, well, you know it. You know. I would just, look, I said, ""This is not an Indian."" She said, ""I'm an Indian."" You remember what I said? ""I have more Indian blood than me, I have more in me than she has, and I have none."" Unfortunately, I'd like to have some. I would like to have some. I think it could help, it might make me better, but I have none. And I said, ""I have more than she does."" And then she went out to, and she choked, remember that? She went out, and she took a test. And it found out that about 700 years ago, there was a possible event, 1,024th, right? Wasn't that it? Good memory, very good memory. Trump has a good memory. Good moment. Not for that, but for a lot of things. Now, 1024th, which meant many, many, many centuries ago, there could have been a hookup somewhere along the line. But she choked. We forced her into a choke. She went down like a rock, and then she started coming up, up, up, up, up. Then she totally destroyed Mike Bloomberg. We call him Mini Mike. Remember? Mini Mikey wants that platform. ""I want a platform, damn it."" I don't mind. Oh, boy, he was pathetic, but now he's going to try and buy his way back into the Democrat party. You remember that guy? Great environmentalist. Except he made his money with coal, which is okay, I think coal is good. Clean coal, I like clean coal. If we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. You know that. He was way behind. This was months later. And then I watch him last night, reading something saying that, I opened, I closed it up, one week later, one week. Two months later, he was talking about the fact that I shouldn't be doing that to China. I shouldn't be banning China because I was xenophobic. And it's just unbelievable. And now they will say anything. It's called disinformation. They will make up a lie, they will make up a story, and they go with it, it makes no difference whether or not it's show, and they'll take ads. It's the worst group of people. He's surrounded by bad people, dishonest people, but they're very smart. He's not smart. They keep him from talking. It's actually, if he wins, it's the single most brilliant campaign in the history of the world. Because they took a man who's got nothing. He didn't have it, but he's got nothing, and I will give them credit. The single greatest campaign in history, if he wins, but you know what? If he wins, North Carolina is screwed, and so is every place else. And you can forget your tobacco industry, you can forget your farmers. I gave the farmers $28 billion. Thank you very much, Presidency. $28 billion. Because you were targeted, right? You were targeted by China. And I said, ""How much were the farmers,"" Iowa, Nebraska, you, all of them? You were targeted. I said, ""How much?"" Sonny Perdue, I said, ""How much, Secretary?"" 12 billion, then 16 billion, you were targeted. I took it out of the tariffs we charge. We never took 25 cents in from China, now we're getting billions and billions and billions of dollars. Sleepy Joe, that never gave, never took anything, or Trump, misjudging him? So Mexico, we're driving them a little crazy. They don't like Trump too much. But now Biden is recklessly campaigning against his vaccine. His campaign campaign's really reckless. And all it is is for political reasons. It's political reasons. Biden, his whole deal is catastrophic shutdown. We're getting better, we're really coming along, and he's talking about shutting down. We're not doing any shutdowns. We don't need shutdowns. Maybe a little area, if it's such a spike, we understand, we have to take care of our senior citizens. This guy talked, he said, ""Well, I'll do whatever my medical people want. I believe in science."" He doesn't know what science is. ""I believe in science."" No, we're not doing any shutdowns. We don't need, we're rounding the turn. Without the vaccine, we're rounding the turn. With the vaccine, it'll just speed it up. That's another one that will be controversial. They'll say, ""He's saying that it's happened."" Yeah, without the care, without the vaccine, it's going along. With a vaccine, even better. It'll be faster. Biden's own chief of staff said, when they manage the H1N1 that he calls the N1H1, right? He goes, ""the N1H1,"" and that's an easy one, because H comes before, but he always gets it wrong. It's like, seven times, ""It's great to be with the great people of Iowa."" They'll say, ""Sir, you're in Idaho."" ""Oh."" I've never made that mistake so far. But I always say, ""If you do, just leave the stage, because you can never recover."" You can speak as well as, I mentioned, Winston Churchill, even though he was a great speaker, he was a stutterer, and he became one of the greatest speakers ever. You could be Winston Churchill, if you make that mistake, just leave the stage. You can't recover. But he's made it oftentimes, right, in New Hampshire, and it was Vermont. The worst, I think, I think there was one, he was in Ohio, and he said he was in Florida, right? But he couldn't find any palm trees. We just got a poll from Ohio. Through the roof. Great state of Ohio, good Governor, great state of Ohio. But when they managed the H1N1 swine flu, this was from his top person that ran it. ""We did every possible thing wrong. 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time. And it was just a total disaster."" He basically said, ""We didn't know what the hell we were doing."" And this is the guy that's going to tell us what to do with something that's much more lethal, much more lethal. This is much more lethal than the swine flu. If H1N1 had the same fatality rate as the China virus, over two million people would have already perished. They didn't know what the hell they were doing. And the guy admitted it. That guy can not be very popular in Democrat politics right there. But just to remember, and he's telling us how to do things. We're building ventilators, we're the ventilator capital of the world now, think of it. We're sending them to other countries, we have so many. And we have made a lot of Governors look very good. And they all admit it, until the press comes in front, where they say, ""Oh, he was okay,"" but we took care of them. We took care of Governors, we took care of the states. On November 3rd, North Carolina will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, or whether we allow Joe Biden to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, ban American energy, confiscate your guns. These are all things that he said. Shut down our economy, destroy the suburbs. They were saying that women in the suburbs, they're not sure if they like me. They're starting to like me a lot lately, because it's law and order. They want law and order. Thank you. A suburbanite, thank you, thank you. No, it's true. I don't know. But I heard the same thing four years ago, remember? "" Women will not vote for him."" Then we win the election, it's like, they're all in shock. Well, what took place? ""Well, he did very well with women,"" what the hell was that all about, right? Did very well. Women were great. Now, if it holds true … There a lot of jobs, a lot of jobs, a lot of great thinking, but he wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens. Now, what that's going to do is destroy our country, because two things happen. Number one, we can't afford it. Number two, everybody is going to come pouring into our country if you do that. Right now, they're saying, wherever they are, when you say, ""We're going to give you free education, we're going to give you free healthcare. We're going to take care of you. Everything's going to be perfect. We're going to give you, every single family,"" now watch, they'll print this. ""We've checked it out, and he lied about this."" Every single family is going to be given a brand new Silver Cloud Rolls Royce. Now, I said that, and CNN went, ""He lied about the fact that they're not getting a Rolls Royce."" Remember what I said? "" Russia, if you're listening,"" in front of this message, ""Russia, if you're listening, find out where her e-mails,"" or whatever. And then, everybody laughed, I laughed. Well, they actually play it all the time. ""When he spoke to Russia."" Do you ever see it? And they cut it off before the end, they don't see any, I said, ""Russia, if you're listening …"" Oh, these people are sick. He wants to erase your borders. Yeah, that was supposed to be a joke, right? It was a joke. It was a joke, everybody was laughing, but they refused to go that extra quarter of a second. He wants to indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in education. To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I am launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called, 1776 Commission. It's already done. That's good. And it's true, your kids come home, and they tell you things. How many of you, the kids come home, and they tell you things. It's a disgrace, what they're teaching them, it's a disgrace. We're ending it. In fact, we're taking school funds away from these crazy schools that are teaching horrible things, bad things, actually. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. And we are getting better every single day. And no party can lead America, that will not teach our children to love America. No party can do that. The sleepy campaign has joined forces with those trying to tear down America and our way of life. We have a great way of life, and getting better all the time. Look at what we've done. Biden's running mate urged supporters to help bail rioters out of jail, including one who attempted murder. That's right. One who attempted to murder a police officer, and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, 13 members of Biden's staff donated to the same fund. Look, that's where they're coming from, just so you know. He's trying to go a little bit more right, like the fracking. ""Oh, well of course, we're going to have …"" For six months, he's saying, there'll be no fracking, which I don't think the people in Pennsylvania thrilled with, do you agree, considering that your taxes could quadruple. I tell it all the time, Texas, right? Texas, they like oil. They like guns, right, in Texas. Right? And they like God. So he comes out with a platform, no oil. We don't want oil. This is during the Democrat deal. There'll be no oil, there'll be no God, there'll be no guns. This is not a good campaign. And then the fake news says, ""Donald Trump is tied in Texas."" I'm tied. Last time I was tied in Texas until the day of the vote. Then they announced, the second they called it, ""The polls in Texas have closed. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas."" Think of it. He's against oil. He's against guns. They're going to confiscate your guns, Second Amendment's going to be destroyed. I am holding up your Second Amendment. If it's not me, look what I've done. You think it's been easy? They want to get rid of the Second Amendment. They're going to get rid of the guns, right? And religion. So, look what they're doing to religion. These states, everything's closed, except, you're allowed to protest. That's why I say everything we do is a protest. Look at all those people back there, look at that. Look it, they just form. Wow. Turn the cameras around, please. They never do it. Turn the cameras around, please. Wow. Thank you. That's a lot of people. We're proud of you. That's a lot of people. You ever notice, they never do it, though. I say, ""Turn the camera."" Right from the beginning, they never did. They don't want to give us the credit for these big crowds, because you know what? When you see crowds like this, or in Wisconsin, that I had a few nights ago, or last night was so incredible. What we had last night was just incredible, in Minnesota. We're going to win it, 1972, we're going to win it. 1972, it hasn't … That's a long time ago. Remember? I think Reagan won every state except for Minnesota. We're going to win Minnesota. What we've done for them, we've opened up their livelihood again. Maine. How about Maine? I opened up 5,000 square miles of ocean. Obama closed it. They said, ""Why? He had no idea."" Right off their shore, no fishing, no nothing. They called it a monument, right? Right off their shore. Maine, I mean, if I don't win Maine … Maine traditionally is not really very Republican, but I won Maine too last time, actually. Because I love Maine, too. I love Maine, too. But think of what I did. I opened the waters up for fishermen and for lobster men and women. Now they go lobster fishing and fishing. But 5, 000, I said, ""Why did they close it?"" Nobody was able to tell me, but I opened it up, an executive order. I totally opened it up. I did many other things. Then I got the tariffs. They couldn't do business in European Union, they couldn't do business in China, because they were charging tariffs to Maine. So Canada would take our fish and lobster. We'd sell it to Canada for nothing, and they'd sell it to China and Europe, because they didn't have to pay tariffs. Not only did I get the 5,000 … Think of what, 5,000 square miles. So you take one mile, square mile, multiply times 5,000. That's a big area, even in an ocean, right? It's massive. And it was the best area, the best. I got rid of the tariffs. I told them, ""If you tariff our Maine lobster people, and fishermen and women, if you want a tariff on them, that's okay, but we're going to tariff your cars, okay?"" Which is a much bigger deal. It was amazing how quickly those tariffs were taken off. I did that off of Maine, I did that in two weeks, okay? Took me two weeks. Once I found out about it, it's hard to believe it ever happened. So I did that for Maine. And somebody said, I'm down in Maine. How the hell can I be down in Maine, after what I did? I'll tell you what if I do that from Maine, and if Maine doesn't vote for Trump. I don't think I'm going back, okay? I can tell you one thing. Their Senator never did it for them. Joe Biden and the Democrats want to gut police departments nationwide. You know that, right? Here in North Carolina, nearly 50 Democrat State House members and candidates have signed a pledge to slash police funding, endangering your families. I was recently honored to be endorsed by 54 sheriffs throughout this state, and we're joined by many of them tonight. Where are they? Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, folks. Thank you. Thank you. You got to take care of our law enforcement. We got to take care, nobody can do the job like them. We have to let them do their job. We've got to stop this nonsense, this child's play, we've got to stop, they're great. You know, I was endorsed by, think of this, New York's finest. It's very tough. You know, de Blasio's your mayor, he doesn't have a clue what's happening, either. I think Sleepy Joe's worse, do you want to know the truth? Because this other guy has just an ideology that's just terrible. But de Blasio is there, and New York's finest, first time they've ever endorsed a Presidential candidate, they endorsed me, three weeks ago. That takes courage. Think of it. Chicago, the police in Chicago, they could do their job. We don't even have to bring in the National Guard. Whenever we do, it takes about 30 minutes, it's over, right? Like we did in Minneapolis, 30 minutes. Remember that beautiful scene? They lined up, they went down, there was no social distancing in between these great, tough guys. There was no social distancing, Tom Tillis. They went down and they had $250,000 outfits. They had more crap on that helmet with night goggles. And these guys were sort of wise guys, right? They were shouting at them, screaming at them. They were screaming at the wrong people. They went down, they never had to stop. It was just forward. It all ended. It all ended in Minneapolis. It took, you also had, what? A half an hour? Remember, they hit the CNN reporter in the knee? He went down, Ali Velshi. He said, ""This is a friendly protest. It's wonderful to see such a …"" Behind him, it was all fire for a block. It looked like Berlin during the war. ""This is a friendly …"" What are they doing? How does that help to be like that? How does that help? We're joined tonight by some really great friends of mine and some warriors that have been a fantastic help to me. One man who, especially over the last year, he has been so great, he couldn't be better. And I think he's doing very well. I'm looking at some numbers, and you're doing very well. And I think your opponent has some very big problems. Senator Tom Tillis. Thank you, Tom. Thank you. He's been great, smart guy. And he's got a couple of bills that he's putting in, one in particular, I love it. You got to do it. That if a sanctuary city causes problems, you can sue the sanctuary city, you can sue. Will you get, we got to get that one moving, right? That's moving along, right? That's a great one. A man who, I just did a phone call for the other night, and the people love him. He's in a rough district, but he's now leading. I see you're up in the polls, Congressman Richard Hudson, great guy. Where's Richard? Great guy. He's a warrior. And two people I really liked, because we fought like hell for them a year ago, right? And they had guts, and they had what it takes. They didn't choke. You know, a lot of people choke. They choke, they gag, they can't breathe. Greg Murphy and Dan Bishop, they didn't choke, they're fantastic. They are fantastic people. Thank you. Look, they're friends. We're friends. Those two guys were incredible. Thank you very much, great job. Really great job. And a man that should be your Governor, I don't know, he's doing well, but Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest, everybody. Thank you very much, great job. Handsome guy, handsome. Looks like Cary Grant. I hear you're doing really well. Look, I mean, this guy's got this state totally closed down. It's ridiculous. It's, when are they going to open? When are they going to open? Dan, this would have been opened up a long time ago. And you would have done even better. I mean, you would have done better. And North Carolina Republican Party Chair, Michael Whatley. Michael? Thank you, Michael. Great job, Michael. How are we doing, Michael? How's it going? Are we up? I mean, if I lose North Carolina, I'm getting out of here. This is not … Look at that. This is not, just so you know, the crowd of a man that's coming in second. I say it all the time. I said it when I left Michigan. 2016, the night of the election, we had 32,000 people. Hillary was there, just before me, in a prime location. She had about 400 people. I got there at 12 in the evening, I started speaking at one in the morning, it's now Election Day, and I left. 32,000 people, we had 32,000 people. So it's now Election Day. I start speaking, I started speaking, think of it, one o'clock in the morning, we had 30, you never saw anything like it. I left. I said, ""That doesn't look like we're going to lose Michigan."" And guess what? We didn't. We won Michigan, first time in decades. And you know what we've done? Many, many car plants are now opening up. A great gentleman, who's just retiring, Prime Minister Abe, of Japan. I said, ""Shinzo, please do me a favor. We need more car companies. You're selling cars into our country, please. We want to build here, not in Japan, please."" He said, ""But we cannot do that. This is a free enterprise system."" I said, ""I know, Shinzo, please. I need some car companies. Please do it."" ""I can't do it."" I said, ""Shinzo, you have to do it."" Next day, it was a story, ""Five car companies to open up in Michigan,"" right? So much for free enterprise, but he's a great guy, he's a friend of mine. He's great. They're lucky he's a friend of mine. I would have been much tougher. It's hard. When a guy is a friend, it's hard, but they did a lot. They did a lot. They helped it a lot. And what they've done here, by the way, Japan, and what they've done in Michigan, Ohio, what they've done? By the way, we all love South Carolina, right, right? I think we love it. Now, South Carolina, we're winning here, but South Carolina, I hate to say this to you, I don't want to make you upset. We're winning by about 400 points. I spoke to a great person in South Carolina who said, ""Sir, you don't have to come here. This thing's up by a lot."" What the hell is the difference, right? I mean, we are up, and we're up good, but I'd love you to tie South Carolina. What do we have to do? But a lot of activity in South Carolina also, they're doing great. You had the best year you've ever had. They've had the best year they ever had. And you're going to go to a better year, we are going to have a better year. We're also deeply honored to be joined by a military spouse, Amy Williams, who was reunited with her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, at my State of the Union address. Everybody remembers that. Everybody remembers was there. Good, you're looking well. Thank you very much. Say hello to the whole family. Thank you. Thanks to the incredible sacrifices of our warriors, and they are warriors. We're pursuing peace in Afghanistan, it's very close. We're down to, we will soon be down to 4,000 soldiers. We're taking them out. They're serving as policemen. They're serving as police, and they've done a great job. We could win everything, but I'm not looking to kill three million people to win, what? To win what? We should have never been in the Middle East, and we're bringing them back. We're bringing them back, just so you know, we're bringing them back from Iraq. We're down to 2,000 soldiers in Iraq. And in Syria, we're all back, we're all finished, except for one thing. If it's okay with you. I decided to keep the oil. We took the oil, we kept it. And we'll always support America's incredible military families. So thank you very much. Thank you, darling. Really good. Okay. In everything we do, we're putting America first, unlike other administrations, and not just Obama and Biden. This has gone on for many years. We put America first, and that's what we're doing. And you know what? Other countries, for the first time in decades, respect us again. Remember that. They respect us again. You know all about data, 28 countries. We had six countries that were current, and the amount of current is too low, okay? Six countries. I went in, and I said, ""You got to pay. Sorry, you're delinquent."" They said, ""Really?"" ""Yeah,"" I said. ""You're delinquent. You got to pay."" Obama would go, and make a speech and leave, that would be it. We were paying for it. We're protecting Europe, and they're screwing us on trade. So we protect them, and they're screwing us on trade. No good, no good. Can't do it. I said, ""It's unfair."" And the Secretary General, Stoltenberg, of NATO, said, ""I've never seen,"" and the fake news can call him up and check. He said, ""He's the greatest that we've ever seen."" For 20 years, the spending at NATO went like this, right? And America, we pick it up. Every time it goes down, they didn't pay. And I said, ""We're supposed to protect you. You're going to be attacked by Russia or somebody, we're supposed to protect you. And yet you're delinquent. You don't pay your bills."" And that includes Germany. They're paying 1%, they're supposed to pay two, and 2% is way too low. 2% military spending. So we got, listen to this. It never gets reported by these fakers. We got $130 million more, more, not total, more, going to, over three years, $400 billion. So we're going from 130 billion, with a B, not million, to $400 billion. And they said to me, they said … And they said to me, they said to me, very nice guy, head of one of the countries, at a table. I can't believe it never got released, but now we can talk about it, because it's three years ago. But they said, ""Sir … "" And this was a big private meeting of all of the nations, ""Does that mean if we don't … "" Because I said, ""You got to pay your bills. We're protecting you. You're not paying your bills."" Some did, like Poland and some others, but most didn't. Six to eight were current, and we were paying much more than we should have been paying, much more. I mean, it's Europe. We got to defend ourself, and there was no guarantee that they'd help us if we ever had a problem. Right? We're never going to have a problem. We got so much stuff now. We were depleted. Now we have great … But they said to me, ""Does this mean … "" And I had to give this answer. I can't believe it didn't get leaked by some sleazebag. We have leakers all over this place, but a lot of it didn't leak. A lot of it is just made up by the newspapers. They make up phony stories. They say, ""Donald Trump woke up today. He was in a very bad mood, according to sources."" There is no source. They just made it up. Hey, I woke up, and I was in a bad mood. True. I've actually had a … I've been in a good mood, because we're doing so much for our country. We've done so much for our country. But at the NATO meeting, one of the presidents of one of the good countries, all good, they said, ""Sir, does this mean that if we don't pay, does this mean that you're going to leave, and you're not going to protect us?"" I said, ""Yes. That's what it means. I'm sorry."" It was an amazing effect, because other presidents said, ""No. We will always protect you. We will always protect you, even if you don't pay, even if our taxpayer is paying for everything, even though you take advantage of us on trade, you don't let our cars in, you don't let our stuff in, but you sell us like crazy, even though you tariff our product, even though you do everything, and then you take advantage of us with the military."" They said, ""We will always protect you."" So they didn't pay. Why the hell would they pay? They said, ""Boy, these guys are stupid."" So they asked me the question, ""Does this mean, sir, that you will not protect us anymore if we don't pay?"" I said, ""I'm sorry to say, it does."" That's a big story. Three years ago, it's a big story. It was amazing how the money came in. So we took in 130 billion a year, going over a three-year period, to 400, just because I asked. Right? Just because I asked. True. They don't report that story. Then we got lightweights that I fired, and they write books about me, that I'm a bad guy, ""Oh, he's a terrible guy. He treats our allies so badly."" No. Our allies treat us badly. Our allies in many ways treat us worse than our enemies. I must be honest with you. They take advantage of us. Everyone takes advantage of your country, and we don't put up with it. And you know what the funny thing? We get along better now, because they respect us again. Before, they thought we were stupid. They respect us again. They do. I mean, look at Israel, look what we did. I saw Kerry this other day. Is this guy the worst negotiator? Gave Iran 150 billion, plus 1.8 billion in cash. He never walked. Sometimes in a negotiation, when you've given everything, and you can't give anymore, and then they want more, you get up ane walk. Remember the bicycle accident? That was the only time he had to ride his bicycle in a race. 73 years old. ""I promise,"" I said, ""I will never ever … I promise to you, ride a bicycle in a race, or any other time frankly."" I will never ride a bicycle during a negotiation. And he broke his leg, and his arm, and he was all screwed up. And that was actually a good thing, because it delayed the signing of that horrible deal, which I terminated. Nah, we had some terrible negotiators, and they all said, I saw them the other day, this was him like a year ago, ""Mark my words, you will never ever sign deals with Arab countries, with Israel. It can't be done."" Well, we just signed the two great ones, and we got about seven more that want to come in. What a bunch, what a bunch. And then they say bad things about your president. They don't like my foreign policy. I like my foreign policy. You like it. No, we were taken advantage of by the whole world. They're so stupid, so stupid. We've spent the last four years reversing the damage that Biden and his crew inflicted on us over a 47-year period. Joe Biden is weak. He's supported every globalist sellout of North Carolina, the workers, what he's done. And when I say, ""him"", it's him and people in his little group that … You've achieved so much over a period of time. He sold it out. Look at NAFTA. How bad was NAFTA? China's entry into the World Trade Organization. TPP would have destroyed our car industry. And of course, he joined and wanted to join the Paris Climate Accord. That's another beauty. That would have cost you trillions and trillions of dollars. That was actually, I think, designed to put us out of business, literally. Biden has repeatedly surrendered your jobs to China and other countries. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters. You know that. You lost 43%, but I think the real number is 61%, by the way. Biden says that this an election between Scranton and Park Avenue. By the way, he left Scranton. He likes to say, ""I was born in Pennsylvania."" But he doesn't say he left. His father left. Not his fault, but they make it like he's … No, he went to Delaware. He doesn't leave Delaware, that I can tell you. Every time I see this guy … Wilmington, Delaware. Does he ever leave? I'm in Los Angeles. I'm trying to work on the fires. They ought to do some forest management a little bit maybe. Ridiculous. The floors of the forest, it's got 20 years of leaves and trees that are dry as a bone, matchsticks. Forest management. Naturally, this is an election, not between Scranton or wherever it is. It's really between Scranton and China, you know that, Scranton and China. I'm with America. Biden is with China. If Biden wins, China wins. If we win, America wins, North Carolina wins, Pennsylvania wins, and the American workers win in every single state. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from this horrible, horrible deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when I ended the NAFTA nightmare. You got hit so hard. All those empty buildings all over the place, but a lot of them now are filled up because of us. They filled up. When did they fill up? Over the last three-and-a-half years. I proudly signed a brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement into law, which will bring hundreds of thousands of high paying jobs back to the United States, and it's already doing. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. Defense spending in North Carolina has soared by more than $1 billion a year. Congratulations, good job. We launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces. This by itself would be a big achievement. This is one of so many different things, Right to Try, the military, the vets, everything. We've done so much, but we … 75 years, right? Last one was the Air Force. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Coast Guard, they're so good. We have another one now, for 75 years, Space Force. We need it. I never even promised that. Right? One of them said recently that, ""He's actually done more than he promised in the campaign."" That means I'm probably the only politician in history. They will tell you, these incredible women up here from North Carolina. Stand up. Will you, please? These are most incredible people. Thank you. Stand up. Turn around for the cameras, so they can see how incredible you are. Thank you. Man, oh, man. What a life. But we took care of the VA with Veterans Choice. You saw that. What Obama was nothing. It wasn't working, the MISSION Act. That's amazing. And accountability, where we can fire people in the VA that aren't taking great care of our vets, okay? ""You're fired. Get out. You're fired. Out."" We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdad. We took out the worlds number-one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many others, Qasem Soleimani. He's dead. He's dead. I withdrew from last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. I kept my promise, recognized the true capitol of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we got it built. I was signing a sheet of paper, you've heard this story, $1.1 billion. I said, ""What's this for?"" They said, ""Sir, now that you've moved, we're going to build an embassy in Israel, in Jerusalem."" I say, ""How much is it?"" ""1.1 billion."" You got some friends of mine here, they're builders. You don't spend 1.1 billion on a one-story building. I don't know what's going on. So I said, ""So, does it have to cost so much?"" ""Yes, sir. We're buying land"" So I called David Friedman. He's our ambassador, he's one of the most successful lawyers in New York. He's a brilliant guy. He loves Israel. Right? Love Israel. I call him. He's the ambassador, he's there. I said, ""David, they want to spend 1.1 billion on a damn one-story embassy. It's crazy."" I said, ""Would you take a look? Maybe we own some land."" We own a lot of land. We've been there a long time. Calls me back. He said, ""Let me take a look at it, sir."" He calls me the next day. ""Sir, we have a great piece of land, a much better location that we were going to way overpay for, a much bigger piece. We have a setback building that we can renovate and make it great."" I said, ""That's fantastic, David. How much will it cost to renovate the building?"" ""I think we can do it for $190,000."" So I said, ""David,"" it's the first time I've ever done it. I said, ""David, it's too cheap. You got to spend more than that."" So a friend of mine, Ron Baron, he's got an office building, and he's got Jerusalem stone facing the elevators in this high-rise building, Jerusalem stone. And every time I go in, he goes, ""Oh, you got to see Jerusalem stone."" And he paid a fortune for it. He's so proud of it. He doesn't talk about anything but his Jerusalem stone. I said, ""David, do me a favor. You're I Jerusalem. Right?"" ""Yes."" ""Do they have Jerusalem stone?"" ""They got so much, we don't know what to do with it."" I said, ""Use all Jerusalem stone when you're rebuilding the building, when you do your renovation. Everything, wrap it in Jerusalem stone."" So I think we ended up spending, to fix up the building, like $500,000. Can you believe it? We were going to spend 1.1 billion, and by the way, it would never get built. It wouldn't be built in 20 years from now. And they like it so much, they gave up the plan. They think this is better. It's a better location, it's probably a better building. But I could tell you stories like that all night long, the aircraft carriers that cost 10 times more than they should cost, and then they use the electric catapults. You've heard that. Right? They don't want to use steam. Why? Because it's too simple, because it works, because it's better. So they go to electric catapults that they're working on for years now. Elevators that are operated my magnets instead of hydraulic. Magnets. It sounds good. Trust me, it doesn't work. One little glass of water. We're in the ocean. One little glass of water, boom, those magnets are gone. I could have told them that. I actually asked the architect, "" Have you ever built a ship before?"" It's unbelievable. You heard the story last night about Air Force One. It saved a lot of money. I said to Boeing, ""No. It's got to have a three in front of it."" They were going to buy Air Force One, 5.7 billion. It's a lot of money, but look, it's a helluva a deal. It's a helluva a plane. What can I tell you. I said, ""How much is the new plane?"" It was signed by Obama. ""5.7 billion, sir."" I said, ""That's a lot of money."" It's actually two planes. Air Force One is two planes. I'll give you a little. They're going to say, ""That's classified information."" Well, they've been flying around with two planes for 30 years, so I assume somebody knows. And our Air Force One is 31 years old. Right? So, look, it's time. A lot of the Arab sheiks come in. I see their plane. They have a brand new one. I say, ""What do we have?"" 31 years, and we're protecting them. Why the hell don't we have a new one? So they finally had, at 31 years old. The new one is totally different, 747. It's much longer, bigger wingspan, much more beautiful. It's modern, it's beautiful. 5.7 billion. So I said to the head of Boeing, nice guy, Dennis, this was before they had their difficulty, which is terrible what happened to them, but I said to him, ""Dennis, I'm not going to spend $5.7 billion on a plane. I'm not going to do it. I won't do it. It's too much."" I said last night, I told this story, first time, I said, ""It's got to have a three on it."" He said, ""We can't do it. No."" He called me up the following day, ""We'll take 200 million off."" Somebody said, ""Well, what are you losing?"" I said, ""Nothing. In fact, we're gaining a generator."" And I said, ""You got to build an extra generator."" He said, ""We'll take 200 million off."" I said, ""Nope."" I said to the general in charge, I said, ""General, can we break the deal?"" ""Yes, sir, we can. We have a cancellation clause."" ""Good. General, execute your cancellation clause. We're not going to buy it. I'm not going to pay $5.7 billion for Air Force One. I'm not doing it."" He said, ""Yes, sir. I'm very proud of this clause."" ""Why? Why?"" ""Because we have the right to cancel."" ""Well, do we have to pay anything?"" ""Yes, sir, $250 million."" I said, ""General, don't cancel it. Take it back. Just tell them we don't like the plane. Okay?"" And I couldn't even say, ""I'm going to buy it from Europe."" The only competitor is Europe. I can't say, ""We'll buy it from Europe."" No, that doesn't work out to well. So I said, ""Don't do it. I don't want to send them a check."" 250 million for nothing. Right? We don't want to do it. So I said, ""Just tell them, ""We don't like it. The price is too high. We're not going to buy it."" But don't send anything, don't put it in writing. Please, general."" ""Yes, sir."" ""Thank you."" So about a week later, the head of Boeing called me up. He said, ""Look, we can get it down, but you're asking for too much."" I said, ""You don't understand. It has to have a three on it, not a four, but three."" So another months goes by. I forgot about it. I get a call from Boeing, ""Would 3.9 billion be okay?"" I said, ""Yes, that's okay. It's got a three on it."" True. True story. True story, and then somebody said … it's true though, somebody said, ""Well, it must be a different plane."" Yeah. I said, ""Yeah, we have a much nicer paint job."" We have a much nicer paint job, you know that, and it actually got an extra generator put on. Okay? So it's actually more. They said, ""well, we could use an extra generator."" I said, ""Is there anything else you need?"" They said, ""Sir, we could use an extra generator."" I said, ""We'll get it for you, we'll get it."" So I had it included in the price. These people know exactly what I'm talking about. It's called included in the price. But think of it, there's hundreds of deals like that. But you're one person, and that's why I got Mark Meadows involved, because he's from North Carolina. He's from North Carolina, and he's cheap as hell. I need some cheap people. Oh, there's many, hundreds and hundreds of stories. I could tell you so much. It's crazy. The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy your country. It would destroy your Social Security and protections for preexisting conditions, it will. He's going to drain your Medicare by giving away our healthcare to illegal immigrants. And I will tell you this, you're going to have socialized medicine. That's as sure as you're there. And Obama lied 28 times when he said you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. It was a lie. Said it 28 times, that we have, but it was a lie. But now you're really losing your doctor. You're going to have socialized medicine. Eliminate private healthcare insurance for 180 million Americans who love their healthcare. They have the best in the world. His running mate sponsored the socialist takeover of healthcare. You saw that. He wants to ban private insurance. You're going to lose … 180 million people are going to lose their healthcare under this Biden character, and he has no clue. They're going to take it away from him. They're going to be running him ragged. ""Sign this. Sign this."" ""Okay. What is it?"" ""Doesn't matter. Just sign it, President, right now."" ""I'm getting tired. I'd like to rest, I'd like to let Kamala take over as president."" That's no way to get into the office, because we're going to have a woman president someday, but you know what? It can't be Kamala. Kamala. Nobody treated him worse, and he picked her. I'll tell you, I was … brilliant forecast. He could never pick her. She called him a racist. Right? She talked about Me Too-ing him. He was going to be Me Too-ed. Right? Me-Too-ed. A lot of bad things. There was nobody. Think of it, even Pocahontas treated him better. She knocked the hell out of Bloomberg, but she left him sort of alone. I think she felt sorry for him. I heard she felt sorry for him. I don't want people to feel sorry for our president. I want other people, really, to feel sorry for themselves, because we have somebody that knows what they're doing. We can't have it. We can joke, we can play games, we can have fun. You can't have this guy as your president. You can't have him. Maybe I'll sign an executive order. You cannot have him as your president. No, but you know this. Everybody knows this. And you know what? People are going to vote for him because they feel sorry for him. I feel sorry for him too. I feel sorry for him. And maybe he'll show up for an hour-and-a-half at a debate. Who the hell knows? I don't know. But you know. You see the condition he's in. You can't have him as your president. And you know what? You can't have her as your vice president, potentially going to be president. And that's why they're pushing so hard, because they know he's going to be out very soon, and she's going to take over. And she is the furthest left person of anybody. She is rated, not by me, she is rated further left than even Bernie Sanders. Okay? He's second, she's first. We will hire more police. Thank you, sheriffs. Thank you, sheriffs. I love the sheriffs. We got the endorsement from all the sheriffs in Florida, everybody up in Ohio and Texas. We have the stuff, nobody's ever seen anything like it, the endorsements from law enforcement. We're going to increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defeat everybody that we have to, including the virus, but we will defend the dignity of work, and we will defend the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep … You know this, right? It's okay, right? We will keep America out of these ridiculous foreign wars. We will maintain American's unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. It's about time. We will end surprise medical bills, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs, which we're doing an unbelievable job on, other than the fact that the drug companies are spending a fortune, because they don't like me much. You will see drug prices, prescription drugs, dropping 50, 60, 70% in a very short period of time. Favored nations clauses. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. You have to see what we've done with NASA. We'll be the first one on Mars, I hope. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriot education to our schools, patriotic education. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, and we will never change it, by the way. We will never change it. They took the word, ""God"", out of the Pledge of Allegiance twice. I said, ""Did they make a mistake."" Did they make a mistake. They didn't for them. They made a mistake for us. We're not going to put up with it. But we will keep, ""In God we trust."" For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina. This is the most important election we've ever had. Remember it. We're going to be a socialist country. We're going to be a communist country. These people are further … they're much further left than socialism. These people are sick. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote. Get out and vote. And watch to make sure they're not cheating, which they will be. Early voting has already begun. Don't wait. Get out and vote. We got to win this. If we win this state, we're going to win the whole thing. This is a very important state. If we win North Carolina, we're going to win the whole thing, because we're doing well everywhere, from Wilmington to Charlotte, from Concord to Raleigh, and from Greensboro to right here in Fayetteville. We inherit the legacy of generations of North Carolina patriots, who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country. And together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, with your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. You hear that, General? We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will America strong again, we will make America proud again. We will America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Get out and vote, vote, vote, vote."
Trump," Thank you everybody. Thank you and Vice President Mike Pence, thank you very much. Incredible. And, hello to Fayetteville. Hello, Fayetteville. It's great to be here in North Carolina's ninth congressional district with the hardworking patriots who believe in faith, family, God and country. Thank you. Thank you. Tomorrow you'll head to the polls to elect a congressman who always puts America first, Dan Bishop. I've just come from a meeting with North Carolina officials representing communities hit by Hurricane Dorian and I expressed the unwavering solidarity of the American people, we are behind you 100%. 100%. The prayers of our entire nation are with the citizens of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and everyone else that was in the storms path, and I will say I was called by the government of The Bahamas and we're helping with The Bahamas. They were hit so hard. They were hit so hard. Who would believe it? We pledged the full support of the federal government through every step of the rebuilding process. And I will say, North Carolina in our country probably got hit the hardest. That was a little bit of a surprise, but I know one thing about North Carolina. You can take it and you'll build it quickly and you'll build it beautifully. And, you'll be back sooner then anybody ever thought and it'll be better then ever. Right? No doubt about it. I also want to give a special recognition to the many non-governmental organizations doing so much to help people recover from Dorian, in particular, Franklin Graham. He's a wonderful guy. He's got an organization, Samaritan's Purse, based right here in North Carolina and the work that Franklin and his family and all of those that are with Franklin Graham we want to thank them. Special, great people. Great People. Thank you Franklin. Thank you. Incredible job. He does such a great job. All over, whenever there's a problem you see Samaritan's Purse and Franklin and his people. We love the people of this state and we will never ever leave your side. North Carolina will truly recover so fast. I know you people so well. Let's not even talk about it. Let's not even talk about it. We're here tonight to discuss the extraordinary progress we're making as a nation and how to ensure this amazing resurgence keeps on going and going strong. In just over two years, we've taken this big beautiful ship and it's being turned around very quickly. Nobody thought this would happen. You know we won the greatest election, certainly one of them, but maybe the greatest, but we won… let's say one of the greatest, this way I won't be criticized. They'll say, ""You know, George Washington had a great election too."" The fake news right. The fake news. But, we won one of the greatest elections in history and because of that, and you would be in big trouble if we didn't, I can tell you that. You'd be… Instead of going up we were heading in the wrong direction. We have the number one economy anywhere in the world. And every time I meet a foreign leader, almost every time, they say, ""Congratulations on what you've done with the economy."" I said, ""I didn't do it. I just set a certain path. The people of the United States did it."" Number one anywhere in the world. And they tried to do the recession thing. You know, they tried the Russia thing. That didn't work. They tried many other things. I always say, ""The media and their partner, the Democrats."" I wouldn't mind fighting the Democrats, but we really have to look at it as a two-some. It's the media and the Democrats. It's one and the same. We're rebuilding our military, defending our sovereignty and reclaiming our dignity as a nation. America is winning again and America is respected again. They respect America. By the way, I have about 10 women in the front row and you come from North Carolina and they travel all over the place. Hold up your hands. These are great women. I see them so much, and I must say they have other things to do. They look rich as hell to me, I don't know. How many is this? How many rallies have you come too? They can't count. They said all of them except for two. That's a lot of rallies and it all emanates from this area. That's so great. Well, at least you won't have to travel so far for this one, right? Thank you very much for being here. We really appreciate it. Well, we appreciate it. We appreciate it. Thank you. Really incredible people. But you know, we've created six million new jobs since election day and I couldn't say that in my initial rallies because nobody would have believed it. Six million new jobs. More Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country. Almost 160 million Americans, nobody would have thought that was possible. We wouldn't have been able to say it actually. We've now had 13 straight months of wage gains of at least 3%, so the people that work so hard… You remember I used to say during the rallies before we won, people worked two jobs, three jobs and they made less money then they made 21 years before and now wages are going up, the economy is doing great and jobs have never been better. So importantly, more than 70 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Nearly 600,000 Americans entered the labor force last month alone. Think of that. And the unemployment rate for African-Americans just reached another brand new, yesterday, all time low in the history of our country. How do you lose that debate? Remember I used to say, ""Why do you have to lose?"" Well, now you have the best unemployment numbers, employment and unemployment numbers, that you've ever had as African-Americans, as Asian-Americans, as Hispanic-Americans. The best numbers we've ever had, and by the way, African-American youth unemployment has also reached the lowest level ever recorded in history. And, the labor force participation rate for women is at the highest level now in 15 years, and soon will be 35 years, and soon, I promise, will probably end up being better than ever. I can tell you the unemployment numbers for women are the best they've been now in 72 years. So, I always say kiddingly, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it historic,"" but you know what? It's going to be historic very soon. It'll be historic very soon. And, here in North Carolina, over 230,000 more people now have jobs and small business formation has skyrocketed by more than 25%. Amazing. But, the radical democrats want to dismantle, demolish, and destroy everything that you've gained, and they will do it, and it won't take that long. And, that's why we need Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy. We need them. We need them going down. We need them going down to congress and helping. But, they can do it. It's also why we need four more years. It has to… See, it's like a plant. We've changed things, right? Keep America Great. We've changed things, but it's gotta grow. It's gotta develop those roots. And, once it does, it's going to be very hard for them to destroy what we've done. Very hard. And, that's really why I consider this election… Look, we had a very, very special day in 2016. It was a very special day. Very special day. It was an incredible day, an incredible month, an incredible year, and I don't know that you can ever compare anything to it. But, I can say this, 2020 is essentially just as important, because they'll try and take it away. Whether it has to do with religion. Our evangelicals are here tonight, and they're all over the place. And, what we've done for them, and for religion, is so important. You know, the other side, I don't think they're big believers… They're not big believers in religion. That I can tell you. You listen to some of them. They're trying, and they're trying put out little statements. They're not working too well. Little statements that are a little bit, sort of, not too good, huh? What is the word we want to use? Yeah, a little… Nah. Nah. They're pushing a little hard, and it's not working. To stop the far left, you must vote in tomorrow's special election. So important. Or, get your votes in early. I think a lot of… Who voted early for Dan Bishop? Good. Well, that's good, but the big thing is tomorrow. Tomorrow is the election, and you'll get out. To protect your family, you must defeat open borders. And, you have Democrat named Dan McCready, and he wants open borders. He wants sanctuary cities. He's not going to protect your Second Amendment. He's doing nothing on your Sec… You know, North Carolina's a very big Second Amendment state. And, Dan Bishop, Greg Murphy, these guys, they're going to protect your Second Amendment. But, one of the biggest issues in this election is, in fact, sanctuary cities. McCready supports sanctuary city policies that force prisons and jails to release criminal aliens directly into your neighborhoods. Get out. Go ahead. Go into the neighborhood. Go into… What's your neighborhood. Where do you… What? Rutherford County! Okay. So, how do you feel about having them released, hardened, horrible criminals into Rutherford County? I don't think so. But, your whole state… Honestly… Can I be honest? It's crazy what's happening. This whole thing with sanctuary cities, and you go to California, which is so many sanctuary cities, they don't know what's happening out there. You have people that want to get ride of those sanctuary cities, they just aren't able to do it with the people that get elected. A lot of illegal voting going on out there, by the way, a lot of illegal voting. In August, McCready said it was ""the right call to set illegal alien criminals loose in the great state…"" I'm using the words great state. He doesn't. ""… Of North Carolina."" With the support and encouragement of McCready, sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina have released thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into your communities, and you see it. You see it. The charges against these freed criminals includes sexual assault, robbery, drug crimes, kidnapping, and homicide. Murder. Why would you do it? Why would you do it? What is it? Explain it. Just recently, Mecklenburg County set free an illegal alien charged with first-degree rape and crimes against a child. Support for sanctuary cities is disloyalty to American citizens, and McCready wants sanctuary cities with all of their protections for people that are serious criminals. Tomorrow is your chance to send a clear message to the America-hating left, and it's gotta be. And, by the way, we're building that wall, and it's going up very big. Very big. And, you think it's easy to get money when you have the entire Democrat party… And, they control the House, and we want to change that. We want to flip the house. We'll get so much. It'll be amazing what we can do for our country. We don't want dangerous criminal aliens roaming free in North Carolina. We want to take care of it. This state should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. Our great Republican candidate, Dan Bishop, will fight with everything he has to stop sanctuary cities and defend the people of this great state. Dan, come on up. Dan Bishop, everyone. Get out and vote. Come on up, Dan. We need a doctor. A doctor in the house, please. A doctor, please. Doctor in the house. Thank you. Take your time, please. Take your time. We've got plenty of time. Thank you. Take your time. Thank you, Doctor. Take your time. People have been standing outside for two days to get in, so this happens. Thank you. Thank you, Doctor. Doing better? Good. That's good. That's good. That's great. That's really great. Thank you! Thank you, sir. Thank you. That's really great. Thank you very much. I guess Dan's speech wasn't so good. What do you think? That's great. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Dan. That was a good job. That was a good job. He means it, too. He's great. Go out and vote tomorrow for Dan Bishop, please. So, we've had great support over the last six months in particular from a man who happens to be your senator right now, and we need him to keep going, because he has been fantastic. And, I believe he's here tonight. I just came in. The weather wasn't so great to be traveling today, and they said, ""Maybe we could skip North Carolina today, sir."" So, I said, ""No, thank you."" I said, ""No, thank you."" Can you imagine? And, by the way, I have to say, we have a big crowd in here, right? You haven't seen outside. Thousands and thousands of people who couldn't get in. And, when people wait two or three days to come in and especially these first rows, I just want to tell you we really thank you. Incredible. But, Thom Tillis has really worked with us over the last period of time. He's recently introduced a bill to give American victims the right to sue sanctuary cities. That's a big deal. And hold them accountable for the lives that they've shattered. But, to pass the bill, we need more Republicans. Tomorrow there is another crucial special election, and we have a fantastic guy running in that one, too, Republican Greg Murphy. It looks like he's in good shape, but you've got to get it out. So, I want to introduce Thom Tillis, and I want to introduce Greg Murphy. I want to thank you both. Thank you. Thank you, Thom, and thank you, Greg. So, Greg Murphy is looking to, like Dan, cut your taxes, defend your Second Amendment, support our policies, really, really support our military and our veterans. We have rebuilt our military. Greg Murphy, come on up for a second here. Greg Murphy. Come up. Come up, Greg. Come on up, Greg. Come on up, Greg. Just for a second. Then, we'll get back to business. We've got to do this, and I don't know. He's been a great champ Thank you, Greg. Come. Please. Good luck tomorrow, Greg. Get out there and vote for those two guys. They're terrific. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many more terrific Republican leaders. A man who's really been stepping up to the front. He defended Justice Kavanaugh when he was treated so badly. I've never seen anything like the treatment that Justice Kavanaugh received. And, everybody respects him, and everybody likes him. And, I like him, and we used to fight like hell, right? But, we don't fight anymore. We like each other a lot, and he's a special man. And, he's become a special friend. Senator Lindsay Graham. Another man who is a fighter… I guess we're all fighters. You have to be a fighter or you're not going to be here very long. I can tell you that. We've got to fight them more than anybody else. But, a man who's done an incredible job in Washington, took over a rough situation, and he's become a real leader, and that's Republican Leader, Kevin McCarthy. Kevin. Kevin's working so hard for so many different people. He wants to see Dan and Greg win so badly. Thank you for being here. Appreciate it, Leader. Representative David Rouzer. David, thank you. David Rouzer. He's done a fantastic job. Our lieutenant governor who is going to be, I think, a highly competitive candidate for a very important race, Dan Forest. Thank you, Dan. Thank you very much, Dan. We also have North Carolina Republican Party Chair, Michael Whatley. What a job you've done. And, we have a man from North Carolina who loves this state. He fights so hard. He doesn't know what it is not to fight. You know who I'm talking about? They got it, Mark. You're all screaming, ""Mark Meadows."" That's right. He's great. So many. Jim Jordan, Andy Biggs, Gaetz, and… I just got so… By the way, Devin Nunez. Devin Nunez. How about Devin? He was out there when it wasn't in vogue to be saying that Comey was a stone cold liar and leaker. But, he knew it all the time, Devin Nunez. But, Mark Meadows is pretty incredible, and do they love… … but Mark Meadows has been incredible, and do they love him in your state. Do they love Mark Meadows. Thank you Mark. Also a friend of mine who's been with us from the beginning, he's not a politician but he might as well be one. He loves us. He loves this party and he loves your state, lives here, Louis DeJoy. One of the most successful people. Thank you, Louis and your wife is… doing a great job Louis. And a very special thanks to my son, Don Junior and Kimberly. Great job. Did Don Junior give a good speech? I heard that. They all said, ""He was on fire."" Well, he's fighting. He loves this country. My son loves this country. My family loves this country, and two people, from your state, that the first lady, before she was first lady, she said, ""You know, there are two people that are unbelievable. You've got to watch them."" I said, ""I'm not interested. I'm too busy."" ""No, no, no. You have to watch them. They're so great, they're so smart. They love the country, they love you."" Diamond and Silk. They are incredible. Incredible people. Thank you very much. Thank you, what a job, and they're doing very well I have to tell you that. Our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100% pro-American. And by the way, so is Doug Collins, and so John Ratcliffe. Thank you fellows. Thank you. Two incredible fighters also. For decades our leaders put global interest and special interest ahead of your interest. You know that better than anybody, and this state knows it better than anybody. They traded away your factories, sold your future, squandered your tax dollars, sacrificed your security, and bogged us down in one foreign debacle after another. But all of that is changed. We're respected again. They're all saying, ""Oh, gee. I hope he doesn't do this or that."" They've taken advantage of us for years, and I have to say sadly, in many cases it's our allies that took the greatest advantage of this country. But now you finally have a president who understands that I'm not supposed to be the president of the world, I'm supposed to be the President of the United States of America. To bring back our jobs for other countries, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We've cut a record number of job killing regulations. No president, no longer how long they serve, has gotten anywhere even close to what we've done with regulations, and that's one of the reasons our economy is so good. And we have tremendous potential upward, and China wants to talk. They want to talk. China's lost three million jobs, thousands of companies are leaving China, the supply chain is crumbling because they can't pay the tariffs, and our country has taken over things that you would've never thought. As an example, hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs, and China is eating the cost, which the fake news doesn't want to tell you. And out of the tens of billions of dollars that we've taken in, because of the fact that our great American patriot farmers have been targeted by China, they've been targeted, because they know the farmer is like Trump. I love the farmers. So they targeted the farmers, and I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, ""Sonny, how much was it, last year and the year before? Tell me."" It was $12 billion and it was $16 billion, and out of the tariffs that we've taken in, we gave to our farmers for distribution, hopefully very good distribution, hopefully very even distribution, we've given them $28 billion so that they're whole. So that they're whole. Nobody would ever do that. Nobody would ever do that, I can tell you that right now, and our farmers know we have to fight. I see it all the time, where some of the networks that are crazy, they have a group of farmers, in some cases they have groups of women, they say, ""What do you think of President Trump?"" ""We like him a lot. We're with him all the way."" And they want to turn off the cameras. They go crazy, but with the farmers you know that. You ever see that? The 10 women. ""What do you think of President Trump?"" ""We love him!"" Boy would I like to put you on television, I'll tell you right now, and they can't turn off those cameras fast enough, but they say to the farmers, ""You voted for President Trump, are you happy?"" And ever one of them said, ""He did things that no ones ever done before."" Who would think of getting 12 billion plus 16 million, $28 billion, because they've been targeted. That's the amount I asked Sonny, I said Sonny, ""What's the amount they've took our of our farmers?"" ""It was 16 billion and the year before 12."" And said Sonny, ""We got to make that up,"" and we made that up. Who would do that? Nobody would do that. First of all, nobody else ever had tens of billions of dollars pouring in from China because it's always been the other way around. China has taken advantage of our country for decades, decades. And I guarantee you one thing, none of these Democrats, whether it's Pocahontas or Sleepy Joe, none of them would be able to do a thing about it, and nobody would ever think of helping the farmers who have been targeted by China. China made $500 billion over the last number of years, on a yearly basis, they steal our intellectual property. So many other things. So now it's just different, and now it's working the other way, and tariffs are a beautiful thing when you know how to use them, they're a beautiful thing. And I want China to do well, and I hope they do well, but they've had now the worst year in 57 years. I wonder why? I wonder why? And hopefully it'll all work out. We'll see. We're going to be talking next week. We're talking now. They're going to be coming to the United States in two or three weeks, and we'll see what happens, but unless we're going to make a good deal or a fair deal for our country, let's face it, we can not go back to a situation. We're giving hundreds of billions of dollars to China becomes standard fare. Not going to happen, we can't do it, and we have many other countries also, but we'll worry about them a little bit later. Plenty of others, they've taken advantage of our country like you wouldn't believe, and I've been saying this for many years. I was saying this when I was a private citizen. They take our jobs, they make our product, they sell the product into our country with no tax, no nothing. So we end up with closed factories, no jobs, no taxes, no nothing, and these other countries gain. As an example, Mexico, I must say they've really helped us at the border. The Democrats will not doing anything about these horrible open loopholes, which would be so good. So we're doing it a different way, and Mexico is now patrolling with 27,000 troops. They've never had two troops steward our border, and you saw the numbers today were down approximately 57%. But our country could fix it so easy if the Democrats would sit with me for 15 minutes, but they don't want to do that because they want to have open borders. They want to have drugs pouring into our country. You have to have a wall and you have to stop it, and when you look at what's happening with human trafficking, and it's mostly women, they traffic in women and they pour through our borders. Well, every inch of wall that we put up is vital and we're putting up miles and miles, and we intend by next year, at the end of the year, to have anywhere between 400 and 500 miles of wall built, and this is serious wall. This is the real deal. Serious wall. And I want to thank our new Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, for the job he's done and he views it really as a national security threat, and you have to. What can be much more threatening that people that want to pour across our borders, and we have the worst walls, we have the weakest walls in the history of any country? You can't do anything to stop them. You have program, catch and release. You catch them and then you have to release them, and they're suppose to come back to court in the next three, four, fix, six years, and nobody shows up, and Democrats don't want to fix it. So we're stopping them, so we don't even have to worry about court. We ended the last administrations cruel war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And for all of these crazy people, but they're not so crazy, they know what they're doing, that talk about Russia, Russia, Russia. Russia's not too happy about that. Their primary source of income is oil and gas, and now we're bigger than Russia, bigger than Saudi Arabia. We're bigger than everybody, and we're doing great. So they're not exactly happy. The Russian Hoax, was a pure hoax, you saw that with Comey the other day. Yet every leading Democrat running for president pledges to ban the energy that drives our economy, and wage an under… If you look at what's going on your way of life is under assault by these people. I mean, I go out and sometimes I'll get these huge audiences, and I wish we could've gotten a large arena than this. We tried. I was even willing to stand out in the rain and get my hair soaking wet, but they said it was a little bit out of your district, and I said, ""I don't know if it looks good being out of your district."" But I was willing to do it, I would've taken it. I would have been very proud to have done it. It would've shown it's my real hair at least. It wouldn't be pretty, but it's my hair. May not be great, but I will say it's better than most of my friends who are the same age. A lot better. A lot! But we had a different location, as you all know, and we said, ""Let's do this one. It's bigger."" And we put screens outside for all of the people. We have screens and loud speakers and everything. It's really amazing what's going on out there, but after years of building up there countries, we are finally building up our country, that's the bottom line. The last administration, with Biden and Obama at the helm, they tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals that ever been negotiated, the Transpacific Partnership. You could've kissed many of your industries goodbye. TPP would've gutted the American auto industry. It would've been even worse than NAFTA, and we know how bad NAFTA was. All you have to do, is even to this day, look around at all those empty plants where people moved down and companies moved down to Mexico. Not under the USMCA. We got to get Nancy Pelosi to put it in for a vote, make it bipartisan. She'll have tremendous Democrat support. The farmers want it, the unions want it, the manufacturers want it, and by the way, 600,000 manufacturing jobs in this country, remember? You would need a magic wand. You can't do that anymore. Well, we did it, but we've got to get USMCA put up for a vote by the Democrats. But in my first week in office I proudly withdrew from that job destroying TPP catastrophe, and we're replacing one of the worst trade deals ever made by any country. You can go back as far as you want, NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. So whatever you do, start talking to your people, we need a vote on the USMCA. That's United States, Mexico, and Canada, and they've already voted. They want it and we want it, and it's great for the farmers. It's great for everybody. We're also aggressively combating a problem that you have in North Carolina, problem that we have in almost all states, the opioid epidemic. Last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in nearly 31 years. At the center of the American drug crisis is the border crisis. Criminal cartel smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across our souther border, including heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl. 100,000 people a year die from what comes across our souther border, and we can get the Democrats to help us in sealing it even tighter. We got to get them. We got to get them. We got to get them. So if you want to stop the drug smugglers, the human traffickers, the viscous MS13 gang members, and by the way thank you to ICE. These people go into those nests, we call them nets. These are vicious, vicious people. We got into the nests with our ICE people, and for them it's another day at the office. There aren't too many people in this room that want to do it for a living. Let me see. That guy would. Maybe him, maybe her, right? Maybe her. But it's a rough job and they get so little praise for the job that they do. So dangerous. These are many killers in those gangs, and we're taking them out of our country by the thousands, MS13. And as you know, Democrats even want to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants. As long as I'm your president I will never, ever let Democrats take away your healthcare, and give it away free to people that have entered our country illegally. We can't do that. It's a tremendous incentive to come in. Democrats also want to bring in unlimited numbers of foreign refugees from overseas, all at the expense of supporting their own communities. Republicans, no matter what you do, where you are, we want people to obey our laws. You want people that are going to help our country. The Democrat party has never been farther outside of the mainstream. Every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid Medicare, force private doctors out of medicine, and lead to the rationing of life saving treatments. And they want to take away your private healthcare, your private insurance. 180 million people will lose with what they want to do. It's a disaster. It's like, did you ever really feel where you don't even have to treat people nicely? You don't have any choice, you have to vote for me. I can leave right now. I can say, ""North Carolina, I've had it with you. I'm leaving right now."" And you know what? You got to go out and vote. What are you going to do? Put one of these crazy people running our country again? But it's never been so far left. I told a story the other day about a business man I saw, one of the biggest in the country. You probably know his name. He's hated me for 20 years, and I've hated him also. Okay? Now they're going to go out tomorrow, ""Breaking news, Donald Trump hates people."" You're sort of right about that. I never liked this guy, and I see him in the White House, and I say, ""What are you doing here?"" And he goes, ""Mr. President."" See now he calls me Mr. President. He used to call me something else. ""Mr. President, I'm fighting for your victory."" I said, ""You got to be kidding."" He goes, ""Honestly, you're doing a great job, but also if this radical left gets in they're going to take away everything, and they're going to destroy our country."" And for the first time I like this guy. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you. Remember President Obama? 28 times, remember 28 times, they counted them and there's much more than that I would imagine, that you can choose your plan, you can choose your doctor. It didn't work out that way, did it? Obamacare, and we're keeping Obamacare alive. We got rid of the individual mandate, the worst part of Obamacare. We're keeping it and running it as well as it can, but the premiums are too high. The deductibles are through the roof. It's ridiculous, and we're coming up with Lindsey Graham and all of the folks, we're coming up with a great healthcare plan that if we take back to the house. That's why Dan and Greg, if we take back the House, if we keep the Senate, and maybe even increase it a little bit, wouldn't be bad, and on the assumption we keep the presidency, you're going to have great healthcare. Thank you. We almost had it. We had a man campaigning for eight years to knock out Obamacare, and when he voted it didn't work out that way, did it? We had it, and we would have had it, but we're going to end up actually with a better plan. Sometimes through adversity things work out better. We're going to end up with a better plan, you watch. We'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions also. Always, yep, my word. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 51 years. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. Ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up to the moment of birth, and if you look at the governor of Virginia, he was even talking about essentially you would say an execution. He was talking after the baby is born, the doctor will talk to the mother and they'll make the decision as to whether or not that baby lives. This is a radical Democrat idea. That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and socialism. They're socialists. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream. Every day they're making good on the motto, ""Promise made, promises kept."" In fact, we are keeping even more promises by far than we made, or than we promised. So many more. So many more. So many more. You know what we did with respect to people that are very sick or terminally ill, right? Right to try it's called. I love that name. Right to try. We have some of the greatest doctors in the world, labs in the world, hospitals in the world, and we have incredible medicine that's prohibited from being used until it gets approval, and sometimes that approval can take many years. And I said, ""Wait a minute, if a person is sick… "" And they've been trying to get this for 45 years. I said, ""If a person is sick, and maybe terminally ill, why aren't we letting them try this new technology?"" And so many things are happening, and we did Right to Try. And it wasn't easy, but I was helped by Lindsey and a lot of great people. A lot of great people. All of them helped. Mark helped so much. All of them help. Rick. We have had a tremendous success. We had so many people wanting to help, but it was complicated believe it not because the country didn't want the liability. I said, ""You know what you do? You draw up an agreement taking away liability."" They said, ""That's a good idea."" The insurance companies and the drug companies were very unsure. This has been going on for many years. I got it done. The results have been unbelievable. Right to Try. Things that we've never even talked about we're getting done. Maybe one of the biggest things is within about a month, we'll have close to 180 federal judges, including the public division judges. Including two great new Supreme Court Justices. Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Justice Brett Cavanaugh, who they put through hell. We passed something that they've wanted to do for half a century. We passed VA Choice. So when your great and honored veterans are waiting in line for three weeks, four weeks, five days, 10 days, two months, they go to a private doctor, we pay for the bill, and they get themselves taken care of, instead of dying, which was happening. And we also passed VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. That means when they treat our veterans, and they wouldn't have done it in primetime I can tell you, but when they treat our sick and trouble veterans badly we can say, ""You're fired. Get the heck out."" It's called VA Accountability. That's another one we've been trying, and in all fairness the unions made it very tough. Civil service made it almost impossible. Everyone said, ""You're never going to get it done."" We got it done. We want to thank the Republican Senate. I want to thank some incredible people in the House of Representatives, and Kevin I want to thank you… … people in the House of Representatives. And Kevin, I want to thank you because that was a great job you did on that one. That was a great job, thank you, Kevin McCarthy. We've received record funding for the US military, 700 billion last year, 716 billion dollars this year, 738 billion dollars … And you know, know I'm a big believer in budgets but we have no choice. We had to rebuild our military with all that's going on today with China, with Russia, with radical Islam, with everything that's happening, we had to do something. And you know, budgets are fine, I love budgets and we will get to that, don't worry about it. But we had to rebuild, our military was totally depleted, it was totally depleted. We have beautiful new F-35's, F-18's, new ships, new missiles, new rockets, we have new everything. I came back with Admiral Brown, the United States Coast Guard and some of the other folks, and they were saying that the new Coast Guard cutters … How good a job has the Coast Guard done during these hurricanes? And I said, ""Admiral, how good are the new Coast Guard cutters?"" He said, ""They're the finest in the world, sir."" And they had old broken equipment that they had to keep going on a shoestring. They have brand new Coast Guard cutters. We had to do it, we had to do it. There's always time for the other but we had to do it. We've rebuilt our military, we've taken care of the great people that work in our military. We gave them a raise, a beautiful raise they were so entitled to. And I also got other NATO members to pay an additional 100 billion dollars over the last year and a half that they weren't paying, they were delinquent. We're supposed to protect them and they don't pay, I say you can't do that. You can't do that, you got to pay, NATO. Now we're finally making immensely wealthy countries pay the cost of their defense, we're negotiating with a lot of them. Think of it, we have these immensely wealthy countries and they're paying for a fraction of our cost to defend them. How did that happen? And do you know what the biggest excuse is when I go to them and I'll say, ""King, you got to pay,"" or, ""Mr. Prime minister, you got to pay,"" or, ""Mr. President, you've got to pay,"" you know? It's costing us billions of dollars to protect these wealthy. You know what their biggest thing is? Because I can't understand how we did this for so many years, decades, decades … ""You have been defending all of …"" I won't mention names because I don't want to embarrass anybody. I don't want to, forget it, some of the wealthiest countries in the world. And when I say, ""King, President, Prime Minister, Queen,"" no matter what I say, you know what they say? ""But nobody's ever asked us to do that before,"" that's the only excuse. Because I say to them, ""Why would we do this? Why are we defending you? You're immensely wealthy, you compete with us on trade."" We have lousy trade deals that we are renegotiating many of them and ultimately all of them. ""Why are we protecting you, Mr. President?"" ""Well, I don't know, I don't know."" But you know what their answer is? ""Because you've always done it."" That's not a great answer. So we're taking in billions and billions but I've got 100 billion dollars and the Secretary General of NATO, Stoltenberg, is my biggest fan. He said, ""Until President Trump, you had to see the data across the spending was going like this."" And ours was going like this, we were defending many countries that treat us very badly on trade and very unfairly. We were defending them and now it's changing, around 100 billion dollars, they're not happy. And then I read where Obama is more popular in Germany than Trump. He's got to be, I'm making people pay their bills, he's got to be. You know, the day that I'm more popular than him, I'm not doing my job. The big story, they like him more in Europe than they like Trump. I think they should. 100 billion dollars more they're paying. To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran Nuclear Deal. We paid them 150 billion dollars for that piece of work. I withdrew it and we put sanctions all over the place and they're a much different country and let's see what happens. But I can tell you they'd like to get back to business because they're not doing very well. When I came into office, Iran was a real terror. 18 sites of confliction, they were behind every one of them in the Middle East. And who knows, could have been elsewhere. And I said we're not going to do it, 150 billion dollars President Obama paid and 1.8 billion in cash. Whoever saw a million dollars piled up as a promotion? In hundred dollar bills, it's a lot. Now take a million dollars and make it 1.8 billion dollars in cash. I'm actually more impressed with that number than 150 billion dollars, you want to know the truth. 1.8 billion dollars in cash and we got taken to the cleaners so I terminated the deal. And I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem which every president said they would do. And I also approved for Israel the Golan Heights and if you really think about it, I said to people, ""What's more important, the Golan Heights or the capital of Jerusalem by moving our embassy there?"" He said, ""Neither, sir. What you've done in Iran is more important than both of them."" I said, ""You know, I guess you're right when you think about it."" So we've done a good job, all of us together, as a movement we've done a great job for Israel. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the people of North Carolina. You must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing thing, you. It's true, it's not about me, it's about you. It's about your family, your future and the fate of your country. That's what we did in 2016, they came from the hills and valleys, they came from the cities, they came from all over the place and people were saying, these fakers back there, they were saying, ""What the hell is happening?"" But I knew it was going to happen because we go out and we see these rallies, the likes of which no one has ever seen before ever, ever, ever in politics, ever in politics. A vote for any Democrat in 2020 and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow in North Carolina is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and a destruction of the American dream. We are entering this campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda and the only positive vision for the people of North Carolina. And I've said it and I say it loudly and proudly, I don't believe there's been any president or any administration that has done more in 2.5 years then we have as a group in America. When you add it all up, nobody's done what we have. Our first task is a giant victory. Tomorrow, right here in the great state of North Carolina with your support, tomorrow we take the first steps to firing Speaker Pelosi and winning back the House in 2020. We need everybody to get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote for Dan Bishop and get out and vote for Greg Murphy, you got to get out tomorrow and vote. Together we will lift millions more from our horrible, horrible situations that have developed over the years. Look at what's happening to Democrat-run cities, every single one of them. We are going to lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. With your help, we will elect for Republicans to Congress to create a safe, modern, fair and lawful system of immigration. We will enact great deals that result in more products probably stamped with the four beautiful words made in the USA, made in the USA. You want made in America, I don't care, what do you like better? Made in america or made in the USA? Go ahead. Wait, ready? You want made in America then made in the USA. What do you like better, made in America, made in the USA? Okay, I think we know that answer. So in 2016 we had in my opinion the greatest phrase in the history of politics, make America great again. Now we are within moments hopefully of having, despite what you heard a few weeks ago, where we were heading. And they're going, ""Please, please let there be a recession, please."" They're willing to give up their results because they think it will help them win the election. They're not going to win the election. Don't forget, we are doing this and still fighting the unfairness of China and other countries on trade. What happens when that gets fixed and other things get fixed? We're setting new records and we're fighting trade deals and we're fighting military deals that are unfair to our country. Think what happens when it all gets fixed, We have ourselves a country that's going to be so strong. But we had a phrase, make what? Make America great again, the best. I think it was maybe the greatest, 2016, but we've done a lot and now they're very close to setting a new … I think it's the 118th time that we will have set a new record with the stock market, right? Many, many times, many, many times. I can't be certain that many but it's a lot, okay? I always have to preface it because there'll be headlines, Trump didn't tell the truth. So I've always got to be extremely cautious. We had the greatest phrase of all time and even the fake news media would agree, make America great again, MAGA country, make America great again. Now we still have a year and a half, little bit less, can you believe it? Can you believe it? I stood in the White House with the first lady that first night and I said, ""Wow, look at this. That's the bedroom of Abraham Lincoln,"" you have to see this. It's so perfectly done, it's so the way it was. We announced it in front of the press and in 2026. And I said, ""Well, wait a minute, under the normal rules I will be out in 2024 so we may have to go for an extra term."" Oh, they're going crazy. Tomorrow, you will see headlines, Trump wants an extra term, I told you, I told you. He wants an extra term, ladies and gentlemen. We told you, we told you he's a dictator, we told you. No, no, I'm only kidding, I'm only kidding. But we actually have the World Cup, it's the biggest sporting event in the world and we got it. And that's where we're working it also with Mexico and Canada to give them some of the games. We've got a great relationship with the World Cup, it's a big deal. Bob Kraft helped me with the New England Patriots people. Tom Brady had a pretty good game the other night, right? They have a good a coach, whether you like it or not, and I know you, North Carolina. But how good a coach, in all fairness here, is Coach Belichick? How good is he? I know you want to be cool but he's pretty good. We have to appreciate genius, we all like genius. But we are going to achieve new breakthroughs in science, medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending within 10 years the AIDS epidemic in America. That's shocking to hear that but we can do it, we're going to do it, definitely. Incredible, the strides that we have made. We will defeat the Democrats to drive up the cost of houses, cars, healthcare and education by liberating Americans from their analysts' push for a job killing, soul crushing Washington regulations. As an example, we're trying to get the car companies, going to give them a little bit of extra energy and they will be able to build a car that consumers can buy which will be better than the car they make today. And you'll save 3,500 dollars, think of that. It will be safer, it will be better, you can save 3,500 dollars, it will be less costly. And we're going to try to get that done. And then they were forcing you to buy light bulbs that cost a fortune, so I signed something a couple days ago that gives you the right to continue to use the incandescent light bulbs, I don't know about you, much less expensive lights that are beaming down over us. But you know, somebody told me that as you know, they're much more expensive bulbs than for what you save. But they said that if the bulb break, it's considered almost like the waste site. It's very big, the bulbs, the new bulbs, they're very dangerous with all of the gases. And I said, ""What's the point?"" Well, then he said, ""Well, I'm saying if we continue that production, they can buy whatever they want to buy but it can really save a tremendous amount of money and even have a light that's better."" And there is a big danger, in fact they have labels, don't break this bulb. What do you do, you're going to throw it away? I promise I won't break it, all the new ones. So you can hopefully buy the new ones but you can buy the old ones too and you can save a lot of money and you could even look better. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America, we'll be one united nation. We'll support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement, thank you, law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way like you. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust, it'll stay there. We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two world wars wars, defeated fascism and communism, put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world. We are great Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to you. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and I'd like to fight a little less with these people but they just don't stop. They just keep coming at you in waves. They are unfortunately not the best people. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, we're going to keep on winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, we may have right now the greatest economy in the history of our nation. And ladies and gentlemen of North Carolina, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again, we will. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you."
Trump,"We brought you a lot of car plants, Michigan. We brought you a lot of car plants. You know that, right? Long time, it's been a long time since you had all these plants being built, but we brought you a lot over the last three and a half years, and we're going to bring you a lot more. That's happening. Hello, Michigan and I'm thrilled to be in Freeland with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. Fifty-four days from now, we're going to win Michigan, and we're going to win four more years in the White House. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring Michigan's jobs, outsourcing- We shouldn't be smiling about it, but we've changed it around. Outsourcing Michigan's factories, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars and surrendering our children's future to China and other far away lands. Biden supported every disastrous globalist sellout for over a half a century, including NAFTA, China, and DPP. You know that. Joe Biden surrendered your jobs to China and now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob and you're seeing that every night. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchist, arsonist and flag burners win. But I wouldn't worry about it because he's not winning. I don't think he's winning. This is not the crowd of a person who comes in second place. You do know that. The same thing happened four years ago. It was election eve but by the time I got here, it was late. Some of you are in that audience at one o'clock in the morning now election day. We had 32,000 people show up and the reason I went is that I heard that crooked Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama were traveling to Michigan because they heard they had problems. They were supposed to win Michigan, but they did such a lousy job that they had to come and get some votes. They came and I heard about it. They said, ""Sir, could you do it?"" I hopped in the plane. We landed at 12 o'clock in the evening. I started speaking at one o'clock in the morning now election day. 32,000 people. She had 500 people. I said, ""Why are we going to lose Michigan?"" And we didn't. And we didn't. First time in a long time, but now we're up in the polls. We just saw polls. We're up in Michigan. I don't know if that's good or bad. I don't know. I don't know if that's good or bad because in all those polls where we were down last time, we won. So maybe we're better off being down a little bit. Hello, John James. I see you handsome guy. John James, get out and vote for John. I'm going to introduce you in a second John James. What a job you've done. I have to tell you, he took, I saw this group of people that were running, all nice people, three very rich people and one guy that was John James and I saw them all. Right? I saw them all and I said, ""Wait."" With the wonderful invention of TiVo, one of the greats, you can play it back. I said, ""Who was that?"" He said, ""I don't know, sir."" I said, ""Play it back."" I said, ""That man is going to be a star."" It was John James. That was in the Republican primary. After learning about him with his incredible career and helicopter, and he's a great, and actually a great flyer I heard the other day, a great one, a really good one as opposed to those that aren't so good, but his incredible background and education at West Point and all of the things he did. I said, ""This guy"" and I endorsed him and he went like a rocket ship. Frankly, if he had a little more support, he would have won the last time. This time, I hear you're even, and maybe even ahead, and we're going to win with John James. He's a great guy, but I'm going to introduce him in a second. I'm running for reelection to keep jobs in Michigan. We have got a lot of … Last year before the China plague came in, we have the China plague. Thank you China very much. Should have never let that happen. They should have never, ever let it happen. They stopped it from going into China, but they didn't stop it from coming out here and coming into the US, in Europe and the rest of the world, 188 countries. But it is what it is and we're not happy about it and we're going to remember it. We're going to remember it, but we had in Michigan and in the country, the greatest economy in the history of the world, there has never been an economy. Now, we're building it again and it's being built fast. By the way, it's turning out to be John, a super V. No more V. Now it's starting out to be a super V, but to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, because if we win, America wins and that's what it's about. If we win, America wins. Not only does Joe Biden want to eliminate your jobs, he wants to eliminate your borders. He's promised to flood your state with refugees. You know that as well as I do. You see it all the time. From terrorist hotspots around the world, including Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, Biden's pledged to have a 700% increase. He made this deal with crazy Bernie, a 700% increase in the flow of refugees. So, he wants to lift it up by 700%. This is in their manifesto. He's also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans, overwhelming your state with poorly vetted migrants from jihadist regions. Making matters worse, he would open the flood gates in the middle of a pandemic. By the way, the wall, it's over 311 miles long right now doing very well. Doing very well. Make the mic louder, the mic louder. Biden is waging war against the American middle class. I think most of you are not middle class. You're upper class. You're the elite. You know the way they talk about the elite, the elite, they're really elite. I see them. They're not elite. You're the elite. The elite has decided. Boy, have we hurt the elite, haven't we now? You're the super elite. The left wants to get rid of me so they can come after you. It's very simple. Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, blocked the entry of foreign terrorist, fixed our disastrous trade deals and we have fixed our trade deals good. They are good. In fact, Biden was interviewed today on … There they are. CNN. No, he was just interviewed today. He was interviewed by Jake Tapper who I find to be a nice guy. I don't think he likes me too much, but that's okay. He was interviewed on CNN and they said, ""Which is better, NAFTA or the USMCA?"" He said, ""No, no, the USMCA."" Tapper goes, ""What?"" Couldn't believe it. He said USMCA. He made a mistake. From his perspective, he made a mistake because he doesn't know what's going on. Even though he's right, he doesn't know. There were a little surprised to hear that. They gave him a few chances. Let's ask that question again, but we brought back our manufacturing jobs. We rebuilt the awesome power of the US military. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. Now, we are doing it again bigger and better than ever before. Before the end of the year, we will have a safe and effective vaccine and we will defeat the China virus. I have a feeling … By the way, I think the vaccine is going to come very soon, going to come very soon. With it or without it, we're rounding the turn. You see what's happening. You see the numbers are plunging. You see how good we're doing relative to other countries and other parts of the world, but the fake news doesn't like saying that. They don't like telling you that. Next year, unless you have somebody that's going to quadruple your taxes, raise your taxes, raise up all of those regulations that we cut, next year will be one of the greatest years of the history of our country. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, and two agendas for the future. There's never been a vision like this. You have sleepy Joe and you have Trump. Sleepy Joe, he's a beauty. He's a beauty. He's a beauty. I watched the Democrat debates, right? I watched them up there and he was so bad. I said, ""There's no way he makes it."" It's sad, isn't it? The first lady actually came in and one time she watched it and she goes, and she's a nice person. She meant this really, me, I view it differently. But she looked at, she watched the debate and she watched Joe and she said, ""Darling, it's so sad."" This was early on. This is the guy I'm running against. It's so sad. Darling, it's so sad. But we got them. Joe Biden has put forward the most extreme platform and it's not him. He doesn't know what platform. He doesn't. It's your radical left people. It's AOC plus three. It's all these people. Bernie. It's Bernie. It's Kamala, the most liberal person in the US Senate. I tell it all the time. She started off her poll numbers at 15, 14, 12, 12. Then she went back up to 12 and a half. Then there was a big plunge right down to the bottom and then she dropped out. She dropped out, but there's never been anything like this. No major party has ever had a candidate that's so extreme in his views. Again, he took the manifesto drawn up by Bernie and the super lips and that's what he's going by, including a massive increase in your taxes and a total assault on your second amendment. On November 3rd, Michigan, you better vote for me. I got you so many damn car plants. I'll tell you what, I'll be so angry at you. I got you a lot of plants. Is that right? I mean, have you seen how we're doing here? All the plants that have been built, are being built and what about the plants that are being expanded? They don't want to give you credit for that. They just expanded. I went to Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I say, ""Prime Minister, you have to start doing something."" He's a great guy. He'll be retiring soon. He's a great guy, the prime minister of Japan, Abe. I say, ""Shinzō, Shinzō, you have to do me a favor. You've got to send car plants over here. You're sending all those cars. We stupidly don't. Now they've been building it for a number of years, but you hadn't had a plan built in like 42 years. They were the old plants. And it's been amazing what's happened in Michigan. But honestly, it's been amazing what's happened in Ohio and North Carolina and South Carolina and Florida and New Hampshire and so many other places. Our country is doing great. We had to take a pause to get rid of the China virus, and we got rid … We're coming around. We're coming around that turn. I'm telling you, you watch, next year, better than last year. It's going to be better than last year. Michigan will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, or whether we'll allow Sleepy Joe to impose $4 trillion in tax hikes, ban American energy, confiscate your guns, shut down the economy, and tell your governor to open up your state. It's all Democrat governors. And I think they do it for political reasons because there'll be less activity. You'd be doing even better if you had a governor that knew what the hell she was doing. You got to open it up the state. And also, you have to have a governor because right now Michigan's lagging. Great football, great coach, great team. We want a governor, John James, that's going to let Michigan play Big Ten football this year. You've been seeing a lot of the other schools want to open Big Ten at my suggestion. How about Sleepy Joe? He said, ""Donald Trump is against football."" No, no, no. I'm the one that says open it up, let's play football. These people practice disinformation like nobody has ever practiced it. They're liars. I'll tell you, they lie. But we have a good chance. You have a very good commissioner, and the commissioner is working hard, and hopefully, very soon they'll say you're going to play football. And I hope they're not leaving Michigan out because it's never the same if they do. But you have Maryland, where they have a problem in terms of playing. And the governors have a lot of power over that. They have a lot of power, a lot of say. So let's play Big Ten football, right? They want to shut down auto production, delay the vaccine. They want to destroy your suburbs. Look at what I've done for your suburbs. You know what I've done. You know what I've done. Does anybody want to have somebody from Antifa as a member and as a resident of your suburb? I don't think so too much. Say, ""Darling, who moved in next door?"" ""Oh, it's a resident of Antifa."" ""No, thank you. Let's get out of here. Let's get the hell out of here, darling. Let's leave our suburbs. I wish Trump were president. He wouldn't have allowed that to happen."" And that's exactly right, I won't allow it to happen. The suburbs are the American dream, and I will tell you, I have protected your suburbs. I got rid of a regulation that played with your zoning and played with other things, where they force projects into the suburbs of our great country. And I got rid of it. They said, ""Sir, we can amend it and make it less crazy."" I said, ""No, I don't want to amend it. I don't want to do that. I want to get rid of it."" ""Well, sir, why don't we just do a simple amendment? It would be"" … I said, ""I want to get rid of it. End it."" And we ended it. We ended it. I think the people living in the suburbs … which I know very well. I watched Westchester in New York where they were doing things that should never have been done, and it's not going to happen to our suburbs. They want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in our schools. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. For the last four years, they've tried everything to stop us, and they are only getting more desperate by the day. Can you imagine if on September 3rd, they say, ""Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has been declared the winner. Donald Trump has been declared"" … At first, they'll go crazy. And then they'll say, ""Okay, it's time now to be reasonable."" They will have had it. They will have had it. We were coming together as a nation. Very interesting. Before the plague came in from China, we will coming together. It was success. Somebody said, ""What's going to bring you together?"" And it was. We were coming together. I was starting to get calls from Democrats that … Frankly, we didn't speak much. And I was starting to get calls, and then all of a sudden we saw the plague pour in, and we saw what was happening, and it really stopped things. But success was getting very, very close to bringing us all together. And then we had to say, ""Let's take a time out. We got to fix this mess."" And we did, and now we're coming back strong, but success brings us together, and it was happening, and then we got that terrible situation happened, and we'll never forget it. Biden and his party tried to lock law-abiding Americans into their homes while they encourage rioters and vandals rampaging through, in all cases, Democrat-run cities. Republican-run cities are doing very well. I hope you know that. And I hope you know, like in Minneapolis, we were asked to come in, we went in, we took care of that problem in about, what, 30 minutes? Unfortunately, they let almost two weeks go by. And if you look at what we just did in Wisconsin, which was so amazing, three days, and we went in. And by the way, the US Marshals went in to get the killer, and that was the end of that. They got the killer, they got the killer. You know what I'm talking about. And we were going to go into Seattle. The next day, we're all set, all lined up, looking forward to it. We just said, ""We're doing it."" I mean, they actually took over a part of the city, and the mayor said, ""This is going to be a summer of love,"" right? Where do these people come from? But we were all set to go in there, heard we were going in, we informed them we're going in, and they sent their police to do it, and we never even had to go in. But we can solve those problems in a matter of literally minutes. Thank you. Don't say that, I'll start to cry, and that wouldn't be good for my image. You don't want to see me cry. I'll start to cry. One of the fake news broadcasters, because this happened the other day, we had a tremendous crowd like this. I mean, we had a tremendous crowd in North Carolina. They started chanting, ""We love you. We love you. We love you."" And it's incredible, they said with all the years that they've been covering presidential elections, they've never heard that chant that, ""We love you."" No, it's very nice. No, they've never heard it. True. Now they'll say, ""He misrepresented. 18 years ago, there was a rally held by somebody, and we heard the words from two people that, ‘We love you, sir.'"" Now this is what we're dealing with. And by the way, I look out, there's a lot of people that … Look at this. There's people back there that can't even get in. Thank you, Michigan. Thank you. It's really nice to be with you. As president, I will always support the heroes of law enforcement. I was very honored to receive the endorsement of the Police Officers Association of Michigan. Where are they? Where are they? They're here someplace. Where are they? Thank you, fellows. That's really nice. I'll tell you. That's an honor. I have to be honest. I got it from Florida, Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, South … But Michigan is Michigan. Thank you. I don't think there's any law enforcement officer that is against us. What is our poll number? 99. I know they had 365,000 at one group, and they got a unanimous vote. I said, ""That's pretty good"". How can you go the other way? You people are fantastic, and we love you. Thank you. That's great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Biden says he wants to protect Black lives, but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of young African American citizens. Thousands. The murder rate in Democrat-run cities like Chicago, Baltimore, New York, so many others is higher than in Afghanistan, yet Biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide. You will have crime like you've never seen before. You'll have crime like you've never seen. Last week, Joe Biden proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal Portland district attorney, who has a policy of releasing rioters, criminals, and violent extremists without charge. Biden's plan … And every time I say Biden's plan, it's not his plan, it's the people that tell them what they're going to do, so please understand. I just don't want to say that every time I mention his name. So it should say, ""The people that control Biden's plan"" is to appease domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them, to lock them up. If Joe Biden is elected, far left lunatics won't just be running failed Democrat city, they'll be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Supreme Court, and we can't let that happen. No city, town, or suburb will be safe. On November 3rd, your vote will save America. Remember, it's the most important election we've ever had. I'm joined tonight by some great warriors that have really helped me a lot in Washington with the fake impeachment, the impeachment hoax, the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. Somebody said Russia's coming up again. Adam Schiff said, ""We'd like to find out about"" … I said, ""What about China? What about other countries?"" It's always Russia. Russia, Russia. They're at it again. I want to just thank these guys because these were real warriors for all of us. They love your state, and they love our country. Congressman Jack Bergman. Great job, Jack. John Moolenaar. Thank you, John. Great. Great going, John. He's a tough cookie. And Tim Walberg. Tim, thank you. Great job. What great people. And I talked about him a little while before, I could talk about him all night. He's a star. He's going to be a future star. We have a very much different party than we had four years ago. We're now the party of the workers. We're the party of a lot of different things now, but we weren't really considered the party of the workers. Certainly not anymore. Remember this, we're the party of Abraham Lincoln. A lot of people forget that. Honestly. Remember when they used to say, ""he doesn't act presidential""? And I used to say, ""It's so easy to be presidential."" I'd only have about 10 or 15 people here. You'd be bored. But remember I used to do that? But I'd always say, ""I can be more presidential than any president in our history, except for the possibility of Abraham Lincoln when he wears his hat."" Tough to beat. That's tough to beat, John James. But seriously, if you want to be well-represented … Your current Senator, I don't even know this guy. I don't even know this guy. Nobody does. They don't know who he is. They don't even know. He comes into the office, I say, ""Who is that guy?"" I know every Senator. Democrat, Republican. I don't know this guy. I know your other Senator. I can tell by her hair. She's got interesting hair. But that was John's first crack. He learned a lot. And frankly, and I mean this, if he had more support from the Republican Party, he would've won that race. He would've. But this guy Peters, right? Peters. I say, ""Who's Peters?"" Nobody knows him. He doesn't do anything. I mean, look, we're going to end this, but I have to tell you, John James can be so great. He loves our country. He's been educated at the highest level. He was always the top at everything he's ever done. And this is what he has. And I'll be honest with you, John. I think I can tell this story. John and I were thinking about John. I was thinking about John more than myself because I know talent. And I said, ""John, you can run for a certain House seat, right? And you're guaranteed to win. You can run for another House seat. It'll be a tough race, but you're going to win. Or you can have a tough race against somebody that nobody ever heard of. It's like a habit that they press that particular trigger, but that's a tough race. So you can be an absolute Congressman, or you can take a shot at this one."" He said, ""Sir, I can do more in the Senate than I can do in the House."" And that was his decision. Right? Took a lot of guts. So John, I'm with you. You have my total and complete endorsement. You have everything I can do. Everything I can do, we will do for you. And I really believe you're going to make it. You're running against somebody that is just ridiculous, folks. It's ridiculous. Don't do it. Also with us are some other great candidates and people that are going to do a tremendous job, helping our Congressman. Paul Junge. Where's Paul Junge? Paul, thank you. Good luck. I heard you're doing well, Paul. Paul Junge. Lisa McClain. Lisa? Great job. It's going well. And Eric Essahki. Thank you, Eric. Good luck. Good luck. We're going to be out here helping you, too. We're going to be out here. I hope John doesn't even need help, but we're going to help John, too. We're going to help all of you. All right? We're going to be doing it. Thank you. Also with you is RNC Chairwoman. She was the head of the whole state, and she kept calling me back, back. ""Sir, one more speech, you're going to win Michigan."" Hadn't been won in decades. ""One more speech, sir, you're going to win Michigan."" I said, ""All right. Ron, I'm coming in one more time, but that's it."" I said, ""That woman is the most aggressive person I've ever met."" She said, ""I'm telling you, sir, one more speech."" I said, ""All right, I'll do it one more time, but that's it."" About a day after I got back, I said, ""I just got back from Michigan. It was wonderful."" I get a call from Ronna McDaniel, and she goes, ""Sir, could you come in tomorrow for another speech?"" Well, whatever happens, she is the one that got me here at midnight on … She is. So when it came time to picking the head of the RNC, as president, you have a couple of things to say about it, right? I said, ""Who's that woman that kept getting me back to Michigan? Boy oh boy, she'll be great."" Ronna McDaniel. And somebody's doing a fantastic job and tells us we're really pretty far ahead. Maybe way ahead. They had a poll. I think it was a Gallup poll. They said 62% of the people are lying about their poll. Now, they're only lying having to do with my … And I don't know if I'm supposed to be insulted by that or not, but we'll take it. But we could have a very big win. And look, no president has done for Michigan what President Trump has done for Michigan. And you're going to remember that. And I'm going to remember Michigan. Michigan GOP Chair Laura Cox. Great. Thank you. Great job. Great job. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks, Laura. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. 47 years of bad votes. After the last administration nearly killed the US auto industry, I saved the US auto industry. Joe Biden supported the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for American auto jobs. I withdrew from the TPP my first week in office. That was so easy. That was so easy. You wouldn't have been making cars. You would've been buying cars from foreign lands. We have enough of that. Biden supported the horrendous South Korea deal that would've wiped out US production of the pickup truck, which is the most … The pickup truck is the most profitable thing the auto industry makes. You know why? We have something called the Chicken Tax. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? The Chicken Tax. It's a tariff of 25%, and it keeps other countries out of here, and it expired, and South Korea didn't want to do it, but they did it. We got it right back, and we put it on for a long time, and now you're making … But remember this, go check it out. The Chicken Tax. I'll tell you why someday at another meeting why they call it that. Maybe you don't want to know about it. But we're keeping those small trucks, and we're keeping our whole industry good. And we're expanding our autos now, our cars, and we're doing a great job of it, and I want to thank everybody. Doing a great job. And by the way, many other things in Michigan. Biden supported the outrageous fuel economy standards that have hammered the auto industry, and I reversed that rule. I actually reversed it, and it helped millions of families be able to afford a car. The United States lost 500 auto and auto parts factories under the Obama-Biden disaster. Before the virus, my administration added over 200 new auto and auto parts plants. How about 200? I didn't know that. 200. 200. I thought it was a little less than that. Wait, I want to see that again. 200. It's … … than that. Wait, I want to see that again, 200. It says 200. Do you believable it? That's a lot. You know, I have a choice between teleprompter and freelance. I hate to say, the freelance is always a hell of a lot better, but … If you remember, and you remember well, I actually got elected because of freelance. We didn't have teleprompters. There were no teleprompters. But think of that, 200, we're talking about 200 plants. I thought it was a much lower number. I thought you should put me in an office based on a much lower number. At 200, you have no choice. Yesterday, Biden was in Michigan. He said, ""I better get out of the basement."" This guy is starting to do very well lying about his lifetime of cold hearted globalist betrayals. Biden championed NAFTA, perhaps the worst trade deal in the history of our country. He continued to embrace and promote NAFTA for decades. I told you, he just said it was not as good as the deal I made. I can't believe, oh they're giving him hell tonight. They're giving him hell. What did you say that for? Boy oh boy. Yeah, hiding. ‘Joe Hiden.' Look, this doesn't sound nice. I'll say it, and they'll criticize for it, you watch. But I have the distinct pleasure of running against the worst presidential candidate in the history of presidential politics. I really believe that. I do. Can you imagine if I lost to him? I'd have to say I lost to the worst candidate ever put up. Don't do that to me, Michigan. Don't do that. Biden supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, which, by the way, was a disaster. China was flatlining for years and years and decades and it got into this World Trade Organization with all sorts of advantages. Just a terrible, terrible situation took place. That's when China became a big, powerful economic power. But, if you look at the numbers just before the plague, now, the numbers are different, we were going up, up, up, we were beating them like a drum. They weren't even close. We were gaining, gaining, gaining. We were number one by far. You know, for years I've heard that in 2019, China was going to surpass us. Well, in 2019, we gained a lot on them. We were doing great. We were doing great and we'll be doing even better next year, you watch. Yesterday it was revealed that a fund partly owned by Joe Biden's son, where's Hunter? See his first name, I now name … His first name is where. Where's Hunter? He must be a brilliant guy because with no experience he's taken more money from more countries. He had no job and then he became rich. But where's Hunter who facilitated the sale of a Michigan automotive company to a leading Chinese military defense contractor? Does anyone know that China's military got yet another piece of American manufacturing, Mike and the Biden family made a lot of money on it. It was a lot of money. What about Ukraine? He got $183,000 a month, $3 million upfront and he had no experience with energy, working for an energy company, by the way. What's your experience, Hunter? What's your experience with energy? ""I don't have any."" ""Okay. We'll pay you 183,000 a month and I will give you an upfront payment, Hunter, of $3 million. Will that be satisfactory?"" He goes, ""Yes. I'll take it."" Would anybody here not take that deal? Anybody? Please raise your head. This is one guy, right, you must be a pretty rich guy. If Biden's elected, China will own America. Washington vultures like Biden and others ripped apart entire towns all across your state. Michigan lost half of all manufacturing jobs after the trade deals that Biden supported. By the way, I don't know if anybody … But does anybody remember like 12 years ago? Long before I thought about running for president, when I enjoyed my life, I had the greatest life. ""Where would we like to go? Let's go to Monte-Carlo this weekend. Let's go."" No, I had a great life, but I was honored. I was doing very well. I was honored in Michigan. Does anybody know that? I was given man of the year award by somebody? I came in and I spent like 45 minutes talking about how you've been ripped off, how all your auto companies are leaving and going to Mexico and, by the way, to Canada too. But how they're all leaving and going to Mexico and Canada. I spent the whole time talking about it. At the end I felt embarrassed, I said, ""I hope I haven't insulted the state too much, but why do you let this happen?"" I stopped it. I stopped. It won't be happening. It won't be happening. It's not going to happen anymore. Biden took a sledgehammer to your state earlier this year, I kept my promise to Michigan workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare that everybody said was impossible to end, and when we signed that brand new US- Mexico-Canada agreement into law. The USMCA includes powerful wage protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan. Now they have a tremendous disincentive to leave Michigan, fire all of our workers, go to Mexico or Canada, make the car or the product, send it in here without tariffs. We end up with closed factories, no job and no taxes. That's not happening anymore. That's not happening anymore. But do you remember how bad it was just before I took office? It was like an avalanche of companies leaving our country. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of Michigan jobs. Biden has vowed to remove these tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging. Just so you know, China's paying us tens of billions of dollars a month. Before me, China never paid anything. They didn't pay us 25 cents. You know what I did with some of that money? I gave it to our farmers. I don't know if we have a lot, do we have farmers here? We have farmers. Raise your hands farmers. That's not bad No, I gave $28 billion to our farmers because they were targeted by China. They were targeted. They said, ""You know …"" and that's what they did in the past to other presidents. They said, ""If you do this, we're going to stop doing business with your farmers and you're not going to be able to get any votes and you're going to lose the Midwest and all of that."" I said, ""You know what? I do, whatever you want."" Then I went to Sonny Perdue, Secretary Of Agriculture, a great guy, I said, Sonny, ""How much are they being targeted for?"" ""Sir, $12 billion the first year, two years, three years ago, and then 16 billion, a total of 28 billion."" I said, ""That's okay. We're putting tariffs on everything they send into our country, 25%."" Was going to raise it to 50%. Also, 10% at 12%, all different tariffs. We took in billions and billions, and I said, ""You know what we're going to do? We're going to take, of that, the 12 and the 16, $28 billion and we're going to give it to our farmers who were targeted,"" and our farmers are doing great. That's what we did. Do you think Joe Biden would do that? He wouldn't have a clue. Hillary wouldn't have had a clue. Crazy Bernie wouldn't have, nobody would add a clue on that one. By the way, we had tens of billions of dollars left over. You know what I did with that? We gave it to the US Treasury, right smack into the heart of the US Treasury. And we're still getting those big tariffs. Even though we made a trade deal with China. I said, ""No, you got to leave the tariffs on."" A lot of people didn't know it. Schumer went, ""Well, I don't like to do …"" First of all, he didn't like tariffs, and then all of a sudden he loves it. But when I made the deal with China, I left the tariffs on 25% and some different amounts. When I left tariffs largely on and nobody could believe it. I said to Schumer, ""What do you think of the deal?"" ""I don't like it because you got rid of the tariffs."" I said, ""No, we left the tariffs on."" This is what it is. No matter how you do it, no matter how good the deal, they'll say, ""It's no good,"" because they don't love the country. They don't love the country. Remember that. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. That's a nice plane. Somebody said to me, ""Your plane's just as nice as that."" I said, ""No, it's not. That's Air Force One. That's the nicest."" Always, that's the nicest. I also authorize millions of dollars to save Michigan Soo Locks, and forget all the problems they had. For years and years, they fought over the money to do it. We got $300 million to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and we have done a job on the Soo Locks. They were rotting you. Weren't going to have anything come through the Soo Locks. It's all done. That deal is all done. It's all done. Right? Thank you. Thank you. Where are my guys there? Good job. Right. Even though you're law enforcement, that's a good job, right? Two months ago, I also issued a major disaster declaration in response to the catastrophic flooding caused by the failure of the Edenville dam. Where are the people from Edenville? Yeah, good. No, that was a terrible thing and they're working very hard right now. We're providing more than $43 million in federal funds to help homeowners, businesses and communities in central Michigan to recover from that catastrophe. Thank you. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history. We've ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported over 20,000 vicious gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens. As I said, we've already built over 310 miles of border wall. It's all going to be finished very quickly. We're averaging about 10 new, brand new, beautiful miles every single week. It'll be finished very short. We've invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. All made in the USA, by the way. All made in the USA. You know, with the fake news today, I said, ""And we have systems and missiles and rockets and military and tech. We have systems that you've never even seen before. President Xi has nothing like it. Putin has nothing like it. Nobody has anything like what we have."" They said, ""Is he giving away military information?"" No, I'm saying, ""We have the greatest weapons in the world."" That's what I'm saying. They said, ""He may be giving away classified information."" You don't have to worry about it. These people are sick. Never speak well about our technology because you're giving away classified information. Now, I just want to let people know, we have the greatest systems, the greatest equipment and the greatest people anywhere in the world. There's nobody like the US military. We have the most powerful military in the world. When I took it over, it was depleted. It was in trouble and was exhausted from these ridiculous, endless wars that lasts 19 and 20 years, and you know, those soldiers are starting to come home very big. You know that right?. We passed the MISSION Act, we call it VA Choice and VA Accountability. We hold people accountable if they don't treat our vets good, you're fired. Get out. You're fine. We did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. That's true. We did more. That sort of has a nice ring to it. Right? Think of it. We did more and it's true. Just take a look, Space Force, by itself, that would be a major achievement, and with us, we did so many things, so many things. But we did more in 47 months than he did in 47 years. It's true. It's true. A lot of what I did is destroy some of the horrible things that they did, including regulations all over the place. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We paid $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash. We ought to speak to law enforcement about that. How do we send 1.8 billion in cash? In cash? You guys ought to take a look at that please. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Every president said they were going to do that and none of them did it, for decades and decades, they all said. I tell this story, it was a hard thing to get done. It was easy to talk about in the campaign, ""We're going to open up the embassy in Jerusalem. We're going to make it. It becomes automatically the capital of Israel."" Everybody said it for very, very many decades, for decades, many presidents. But I realize now why it was an effort because as soon as I got in, I was lobbied by everybody, ""Please don't do it. Don't do it. Don't make the capital of Israel Jerusalem. Don't move your embassy."" So went on and on. Then I said, ""Let's do it anyway."" It's true. And the word got out. The word got out that I was going to do it, and I was called by every king and every queen and every prime minister and every … Everybody was calling me, ""Please sir, don't do it. Please."" So I did what we sometimes will do in business, I told them … When a king calls, when somebody calls, an Emir, when somebody calls, tell them, ""I'll call them back in a few days. I'm sorry, sir. He won't be able to speak right now, he'll call you back on Wednesday. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it."" On Tuesday, I announced that I'm doing it. Then I got on the phone with 18 different companies. I go, ""Hey, how you doing? You called, I'm just returning your call."" ""Oh, it's too late, sir. We called about Israel. It's too late."" I said, ""Gee, I'm sorry. I wish you got to me a little bit sooner."" I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades. And by the way, on Wednesday, I believe of next week, Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and as you know, the country, a very powerful, very respected country with a great leader, the UAE, is coming to the White House and we're going to sign an agreement that hasn't been signed in many decades. It's peace and its recognition of Israel and all of the things, nobody thought it could be done. It's an amazing thing. I don't say this out of ego, but I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Now, I have to tell you, that's sort of a big thing and the networks and most of the news didn't cover it. Could you imagine? When Obama came to office, they said, ""We're going to give him the Nobel Peace Prize."" He actually said, ""What did I do? I didn't do anything."" He didn't do anything for eight years, frankly. But he said, ""What did I do?"" They gave it to them in a matter of weeks, right? Weeks. With us, we've done so much. We have done so much on so many different fronts. Remember North Korea? Remember? They were going to be at war with North Korea. Where's the war? Where's the war? Where's the war? And we have a good relationship with Kim Jong-un. Who knows what happens? All I know is, we're not in war and that's okay. They said, ""But he gave away so much."" I said, ""I gave away nothing."" ""No, he gave away so much."" When I said, ""What did they give away?"" You know what they said? ""Uh, we don't know."" I said, ""Here's what I gave away, I gave away nothing."" They said, ""Oh, but you agreed to meet."" Oh, I see. I agreed to meet. So now they're saying, ""I agreed to meet, it was such a big deal."" Instead of being in a war, I think agreeing to meet is okay, right? And we did. He's a different kind of a guy and he's a smart guy, a very smart guy. We get along. Getting along with foreign powers is not a bad thing. We're trying to teach that to the media and these idiots that ran our government for so many years. These fools. These fools. You know, you got nuclear weapons, you got big armies, big navies, ""He gets along with Putin. That's a terrible thing."" No, it's a good thing. If I get along, that's good. He likes me. I like him. Not so bad. ""He gets along with Kim Jong-un."" … Not so bad. He gets along with Kim Jong-Un. That's a terrible thing. No, it's a good thing. I'm trying to convince him. It's okay. It's okay not to go to war. It's really okay. He gets along with President Xi, he gets along with Prime Minister Abe. He gets along with a lot of people, and it's okay. That's a good thing. It's really hard. These stupid people that have been running this operation for 30, 40 years, and they come out against me, and all they did was stick us in these endless wars. We're fighting for sand and blood. Sand and blood. Syria, what do you get out of it? You get sand, you get blood, you get injuries, you get death. These people don't know what the hell they're doing and it's one of the reasons I got elected, I can tell you that. We don't like his foreign policy. And this is said by one of the guy's that got us into the war in Iraq, got us into the Middle East. So, it's … We're doing a great job. We're doing a great job for you. We're doing a great job for Michigan. Just to finish in the Middle East, we killed the founder and leader of Isis, Al-Baghdadi. And by the way, we're pulling back and we're doing everything so beautifully. If we do get into war, we win the war. We don't fight for nothing. We fought for nothing. We don't ever want to have war but if there is a war, nobody's going to even come close to being able to beat us. And we won't be depleted from fighting in all these ridiculous locations all over the globe. You people know that a lot better than the idiots in Washington that has represented us for 35 years. We took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops, Qasem Soleimani is dead. We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home, and they're coming home very rapidly. You see that. Sleepy Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War. He supported the Defense Sequester that gutted our military, destroyed our military, set us back so many years. I got rid of it immediately. He opposed the mission to take out Osama Bin Laden. He was against it. Everything he did, he was wrong on as said by Gates, you know? Secretary of Defense, Secretary of everything. He was sort of like … He had more jobs than any human being I've ever seen. But he said, ""Everything, everything that Biden was for was wrong."" He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of Isis. He was unable to do anything with Isis. as he came to the White House two weeks ago. And we cheered as we looked at all of the success that we've had but he really oversaw the rise of China as a positive development. Remember, he said, ""No, it's a positive development for America and for the world."" He's been in Washington for 47 years now. He's all of a sudden going to change? He's going to change? He's not going to change. Don't forget, he was in Washington in his primetime, which was never considered great, and now it's no longer primetime. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died from the China plague. Biden was willing to sacrifice American lives on the altar of open borders. And now Joe Biden is once again hurting innocent people with his dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, putting millions of lives around the world at risk. And the only reason he's doing that is he knows we're right next to having a vaccine. So, he wants to belittle the vaccine because he doesn't want us to get credit plant, who converted their factory to produce tens of thousands of ventilators, after we invoked the Defense Production Act, and they've done a fantastic job. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator any time in our whole country. They needed a ventilator, we had nothing. We were left, bare cupboards. I always say the cupboards were bare. We're delivering lifesaving therapies, and have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates anywhere of any country in the world. Europe's excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the rate in the United States. You don't hear that from the fake news. Hey, America will prevail over the China virus, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" That's it. We're doing very well. As the British government advised the British people in the face of World War II, ""Keep calm and carry on."" That's what I did. This whack job that wrote the book, he said, ""Well, Trump knew a little bit."" They wanted me to come out and scream, ""People are dying, we're dying."" No, no, we did it just the right way. We have to be calm. We don't want to be crazed lunatics. We have to lead. When Hitler was bombing, I don't know if you know this, when Hitler was bombing London, Churchill, great leader, would oftentimes go to a roof in London and speak, and he always spoke with calmness. He said, ""We have to show calmness."" No, we did it the right way and we've done a job like nobody. All of those great generals, all of those great admirals, our great vice president, Mike Pence, they did a fantastic job. Our doctors, and they don't get any credit because they want to discredit us as much as possible because they want it to carry over to November 3rd, but we've done a fantastic job. I think we've probably done the best job of any country, certainly of any major country anywhere in the world on the pandemic. Through our historic relief programs, we've saved more than 1.6 million Michigan jobs, and over 128,000 Michigan businesses. Michigan has already gained and regained more than half of the jobs that it lost, and if your state was ever allowed to safely reopen by your governor who doesn't have a clue. She's like Joe. You would have regained far more than that. Open up your state, Madam Governor, open up your state. Let's go. Just like crazy Nancy Pelosi, your governor is a liberal hypocrite who lives by a different set of rules. Her husband was caught trying to put his boat in the water on Memorial Day weekend while she was ordering the people of Michigan to stay in their homes, and forcing businesses into bankruptcy left and right. The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy this great opportunity that we're having right now. He would impose job destroying regulations that would demolish the auto industry. You know, on regulations, it took, in many cases, 18, 19, 20 years to get a roadway or a highway approved. We have it down now to two years. We're trying to get it down to one year, and it may get disapproved for environmental or safety reasons, but we're going to know about it very fast. No more 20 year approvals or disapprovals. He wants to force you to provide free government healthcare to illegal aliens. He will destroy your social security. He will destroy your protections for pre-existing conditions, and we will save social security. Remember they said last time? ""Oh, Trump is going to destroy social security."" Well, it's now four years, we haven't touched it. We've protected it, and that's going to remain that way. Biden opposes school choice and has stated that if he's elected, charter schools, so important, are gone. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans, instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we have been through, we are changing Washington. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in Michigan. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity, and that's already happening. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities, and we will ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. And you're lucky I'm here because you're Second Amendment would be gone if I wasn't. And they didn't touch it. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep out people, keep them out of these horrible, horrible situations where they hurt our country, they hurt the people of our country, and we're also going to be staying out of the endless ridiculous foreign wars in countries that you've never even heard of. We will build the most powerful missile and cyber defense. We've already got it, pretty much. And we will maintain peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require the biggest thing that nobody even knows about and it's all signed and it goes into effect on January 1st. You better make sure I win. Can you imagine? This is going to be the biggest thing and nobody understands what it is. You'll figure it out. Price transparency. Did they fight me on that one. January 1st. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs at a level like you've never seen before. I've already signed it. Favored Nations. The drug companies are not happy, I will tell you. Just, all you have to do is take a look at all the ads they're running against me. Favored Nations, where we pay whatever the lowest is in the world, we pay that number. We will protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect our patients. We will always our people. We will your pre-existing conditions, as I said. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will restore patriotic education, you know what I mean by that, and we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust. And I don't know if you saw it, but during the Democrat National Convention and Caucus, they took twice, I thought I was sort of, maybe they made a mistake, you saw that, they took the word God out of the Pledge of Allegiance twice. And then they said, ""Oh, well maybe it was a mistake."" It wasn't a mistake. That's where they're coming from. Don't be foolish. That's where they're coming from and there's nothing that Sleepy Joe Biden can do about it. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for Michigan. So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and your coworkers, and get out and vote. So important. From Grand Rapids to Saginaw, from Kalamazoo to Mackinac, and from Flint to right here in Freeland, we stand on the shoulders of generations of Michigan patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line. It's the place where General Motors, Chrysler and Kellogg revolutionized entire industries. Michigan, well, you know this one, right? Michigan gave us Motown, right? That's right. That's right, Motown. We love Motown. Michigan gave us Motown, gave us Motown, gave us the Mustang and the unrivaled might of the American Midwest. This is the state where tough, strong and determined workers made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together, we will be taking back our country, we'll be taking it back from people that don't love our country and that take back is almost complete. We have to win on November 3rd. We're returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, we are going to keep on winning. Vote for John James. John James. We need John James. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God, and together, with the incredible people of Michigan, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Michigan. We love you, Michigan. Thank you. Thank you."
Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to Greenville, North Carolina, I want to thank you. And to, Mike Pence, you've done a great job. Great Vice President. Thank you Mike. And we have all night, we're going to have a lot of fun tonight, and I have nothing to do, nothing, nothing. We have nothing to do but make our country great again, and that's happening fast. It's wonderful to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of hardworking North Carolina patriots, and thank you for your support. Thank you for that very big victory we had three years ago. Time is flying. You getting ready? Let's do it again. Right? Let's do it again. I just heard that the United States House of Representative, has overwhelmingly voted to kill the most ridiculous project I've ever been involved in, the resolution. How stupid is that? Own impeachment. I want to thank those Democrats because many of them voted for us. The vote was a totally lopsided 332 to 95 to 1. 332 to 95, think of it, we have the strongest economy in history, the lowest unemployment numbers ever, we've rebuilt the most powerful military, it was totally depleted when I took office, and now it's rebuilt. We passed the largest tax cuts and regulation cuts of any president or any administration in history. We took care of our great vets, including veterans choice, and veterans accountability. And they want to try and impeach, it's a disgrace. It's a disgrace. So now we have that behind us, and I have to say this, and I'll say it just once, what happened to me with this witch hunt should never be allowed to happen to another president of the United States. Never, ever again. I want to thank Republican leadership for what they've done for all of us, by stopping that hoax, the Russian hoax I call it, because America is winning again. America's respected again, and, because we are finally putting America first. Our economic policy can be summed up in three very beautiful and simple words, jobs, jobs, jobs. We've created 6 million new jobs since election day. If I would have said that, nobody would have believed it. If I would've said that, the fake news would have said he's exaggerating. And I wouldn't have said it because I wasn't even sure we could do it. Think of it, 6 million jobs since election day, think of it. And by the way, North Carolina has had its best economic year in the history of your state. Our country has added more than 180,000 people to the workforce, and think of that through what we've done on a federal basis. You picked up over 180,000 jobs, North Carolina. Think of that, and you have your lowest unemployment rate. You have a lot of good things, but let's not talk too much about North Carolina. Let's win this election nationwide. You remember North Carolina, that was going to be the Clinton firewall. She spent a fortune here, and I kept coming in and coming out. They call it, earned media. I earned it. I kept coming in and coming out, and every time I left they said, ""I don't think we'll lose in North Carolina."" You know what? I was right. We won it. We won it easily. We won it easily. So I just want to thank everybody. Seriously. This is a big… that was a big deal. November 8th, that was a big deal. Donald Trump has won the great state of North Carolina. A big deal. That was when you started to see the folks at a certain other convention, beautiful looking place. One of the most beautiful venues I've ever seen, but I don't want any part of it. It was unlucky. I don't want any part, but that's when you saw the people say, what the hell is going on? What? What's happening? And then it was state after state, it was Florida, it was South Carolina, we love South Carolina. Right? Unbelievable. It was Pennsylvania. Remember they wouldn't announce the numbers in Pennsylvania, so there was 1% of the vote remaining. If I lost every one of those votes, we still win by a lot, and they wouldn't announce it. They wouldn't announce it. And then we won the great state of Wisconsin. First time in many, many decades, that a Republican won. And then we had a surprise, but not a surprise to us, because we're bringing back the auto industry. We brought so much back to the great state of Michigan. That was a shocker, remember that? Do you remember a certain hand on that beautiful board and they said, ""You know this sport is getting awfully red."" That's Republican. ""There's a lot of red up there."" We had a lot of… That was one hell of a night, wasn't it though? One hell of a night. I think it was maybe, you know there are those that say, one of the most extraordinary and exciting evenings in the history of television and the history of anything. And you know, you can go, all over the world in some cases, it was morning. You go to Asia, you go to Europe, you go all over. It was just record setting and here's the point, we have to do it again. We have to do it again. And the reason we have to not only to do new things, which we will, and you know statutorily and we had all sorts of artificial witch hunts over our head. Can you imagine if we didn't have to go through that hoax? I don't know that we would've done any better to be honest with you. I think we've done more in two and a half years than any president ever< first two and a half years. But could you imagine what it could have been if we didn't have the witch hunt? You said it. He said it. I won't say it because it's a Harrell, it's a terrible word. So I will not say that this guy said, if we didn't have the bullshit, that's all. No, no. Could you imagine if we didn't have the time wasted the time and everything. Can you imagine? And you know a friend of mine said maybe you wouldn't have done as well. Is that possible? That can happen. Maybe we would have had too much time on our hands. Who knows? But I can say, nobody in their first two and a half years has done anywhere close to what we not being what we, not me, what we've all done. It's true. The unemployment rate among African Americans is the lowest in the history of our country. Unemployment among Hispanic Americans, where we're doing really well, you know why? Because they want a strong border. They want it because they understand the border better than anybody. They want that strong border. They want that wall that's being built right now. They want that wall, and they really do. They understand the border better than anybody, and they don't want criminals coming in. They don't want crime coming, they don't want to lose their jobs. They like the fact that their salaries are going up, their wages are going up, they understand it better. So Hispanic American, the best unemployment numbers in our history, Asian Americans, the best unemployment numbers in our history. And likewise women, 74 years. So I'm sorry women, I let you down. It's not in our history, but we're going to be there very soon. We're going to be there very soon. Women are doing incredibly and women… the men are going to get angry. Sorry men. Whoa, look at all those signs. Women for Trump. Wow, thank you. That's a lot of signs. You remember last election, Donald Trump will never ever get the women. Then we got this tremendous number of women. We got this tremendous number of women, and during the election night, they say, ""What's going on?"" you know it's called suppression polls. Suppression. Polls are just as fake as the news itself, but women filled 60%, and I'm sorry to tell you this, men, they're going to sue me for discrimination now. Women fill 60% of all of the new jobs created last year. Women took 60%, what's wrong with you, men? What's wrong with you? But the radical Democrats are trying to destroy all of our country's tremendous achievement, and our country's tremendous success. Unprecedented. We've had unprecedented success. Leaders come in from other countries, prime ministers, presidents, kings, queens, dictators. Sometimes, I hate to say it, dictators, and they all start off by saying, ""Mr. President, I'd like to congratulate you on the incredible economy that you've created. The greatest anywhere in the world by far."" And sadly, China who I have a very good relationship with President Xi, I really like him. But China has had… yesterday it was announced, the worst year in 27 years. We've had the best, and if our opponent ever got into office, instead of being up, 62% instead of those 401ks of yours being up 60, 70, 80, 90%, crash, big crash. You would have had a crash, the likes of which we have never seen before, if they got in office. Because we freed up our country, we freed up our economy especially with regulation cuts, but also with those big beautiful tax cuts. We freed it up. The leading voices of the Democrat Party are left wing extremists, who reject everything our nation stands for. But again, I have to tell you, this vote was so big. I have to thank many of the Democrats. I mean, that was amazing. No, no, I really do. I respect it. I really do. That was a slaughter, but many of those people that voted for us this afternoon in somewhat of a sneak attack, a real sneak attack, many of those people that voted for us were Democrats, and I want to thank them, because they did the right thing for our country. Republicans know that America is the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of our world. But these left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force of evil. The way they speak, so badly of our country. They want to demolish our constitution, weaken our military, eliminate the values that built this magnificent country. You have to look at some of their recent comments which are never talked about. When you see the four Congress women. Oh, isn't that lovely? I'll give you just a couple, I've had pages and pages, but we don't want to bore you. We don't want to go too long. But we have to give a couple, because that's the great thing about live television. They can't cut it. Representative Ilhan Omar, of a really great state, I almost won the first time in decades and decades, Minnesota. Greg Stanton. By the way, I keep hearing how much enthusiasm is in the radical left. I don't think they have enthusiasm. They're just fighting with each other. We have all of the enthusiasm. He goes home now to mommy, and he gets reprimanded, and that's the end. Sorry mommy. Sorry mom. Didn't mean to embarrass your mom. But it's true, we have the enthusiasm folks. Look at this. Look at this. And by the way, thousands and thousands of people outside and people that couldn't get in, thousand. We've got all the enthusiasm. They're fighting each other. They've gone so far left, nobody wants to even think about it. So representative Omar, blames the United States, for the terrorist attacks on our country, saying that terrorism is a reaction to our involvement in other people's affairs. She smeared US Service members involved in Black Hawk Down. In other words, she slandered the brave Americans who were trying to keep peace in Somalia. Omar minimized the September 11th attacks on our homeland, saying some people did something. I don't think so. Some people did something. Yeah, some people did something. All right. She pleaded for compassion for Isis recruits attempting to join the terrorist organization. She was looking for compassion. Omar laughed that Americans speak of Al-Qaeda in a menacing tone and remark that, you don't say America with this intensity. You say, Al-Qaeda makes you proud. Al-Qaeda makes you proud. You don't speak that way about America. And at a press conference just this week when asked whether she supported Al-Qaeda, that's our enemy. That's our enemy. They are a very serious problem that we take care of, but they always seem to come along somewhere. She refused to answer. She didn't want to give an answer to that question. Omar blamed the United States for the crisis in Venezuela. I mean think of that one, and she looks down with contempt on the hardworking American, saying that ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country. And obviously and importantly, Omar has a history of launching vicious antisemitic screens. When she talked about the evil Israel, and it's all about the benjamins. Not a good thing to say. So that's Omar. That's Omar. And by the way, many other things, all you have to do is press the right button on your beautiful screen, and you'll see thing after… You didn't hear this over the last two days or did you hear anybody talk about this? Her colleague Representative Rashida Tlaib, agreed with Omar's characterization of 9/11 and said that members of Congress who support Israel forgot, what country they represent. And Tlaib also used the F word to describe the presidency and your president. That's not nice, even for me. She was describing the President of the United States and the presidency with the big fat vicious, the way she said it, vicious F-word. That's not somebody that loves our country. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Check out her scores by the way, with her green new deal, the green new deal. Where did that come from? She's conducted outrageous attacks against men and women of law enforcement, she compared American border agents managing a humanitarian crisis, that I always said was a humanitarian crisis, and they said it was manufactured. They don't say it was manufactured, and we're stopping it and I want to thank Mexico. They've got 21,000 soldiers now stopping people from coming into our country. But Cortez, somebody said that's not her name it's… They said that's not her name, sir. I said, ""No, no, I don't have time to go with three different names."" We'll call her Cortez. Too much time. Takes too much time. So Cortez also, she said essentially Nazis are running concentration camps, and when Mike Pence went down just a few days ago with members of Congress and the media, and you looked at those so-called horrible concentration camps, they said, ""Wow, these places a clean. Wow. They have air conditioning, they have water."" And you know, to be honest, it's not like they came and we want to take care of people. We got to straighten out our immigration laws. You know, in a very short period of time, if the Democrats would give us a few votes, we could solve the immigration problem and it would be so great. It would be so great. But these kids and these people come from rough places. And I'll tell you what, some of them said, ""We've never lived like this before."" They have water, they have air conditioning, they have things that they've never seen. And we listen to her talking about drinking water from toilets, which was a lie, which was a lie. Cortez said that illegal immigrants are more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be, can you believe that? That's what she say. She described contemporary America, that's you, that's me, that's all of us, as garbage, garbage, a garbage. Remember deplorables, right? That sounds worse. I think that's worse, but we'll save it for whoever's going to be the nominee, and right now, sleepy Joe's not looking too good, Pocahontas. Pocahontas is gaining a little bit, because we probably use the Pocahontas a little bit too early, but that's okay. We'll bring it out of retirement very soon. They have a new one who knocked the hell out of Biden during the debate? He said, ""I wasn't prepared for that question."" That's not a good answer. Can you imagine? And according to the polls, I won every single debate Republican and against Hillary. Can you imagine? Those are the polls. They won't admit that. Many, many polls. But can you imagine if I said, ""Uh-oh, I'm sorry I wasn't prepared for that question."" I'm gone. That's the end of Trump. He's not prepared. He's not mentally prepared, that's his problem. But everybody that knows him knows that. But no Harris hit him with the pretty easy question on busing. What I would say that's pretty easy, and he choked. He choked. And then he said, ""Ah, yeah, I'm sorry I ran out of time. I ran out of time"" He ran out of time. And then you have a young guy, Buttigieg, Buttigieg. They're saying how to say his name, Buut-ih-jij. He's a beauty. He runs a failed city. His city is doing so badly. Mike Pence was the governor of that state. I said, ""How was he as the mayor?"" Mike is one of the nicest human beings you'll ever meet. And Mike said, he never did a good job, I'm so shocked to see him running. Okay. And then he goes back home, and African Americans literally were so angry at him for the lousy job and he's supposed to be like a hot young star, if that's a hot young star, I guess I just don't no star anymore. That is not as star. That's not a star. Buut-ih-jij, you say, Buut, and then add ih-jij, Buttigieg. I don't see him dealing with President Xi of China. I don't see him meeting successfully with Kim Jong-un. I don't see him dealing, and nobody has been tougher with Russia than Donald Trump. I don't know see him dealing with Vladimir Putin. And we have good relationships with them and many others, except now we're no longer the suckers. Like with NATO, we protect Europe. We spent hundreds of billions of dollars and they're not paying their fair share. So last year I went and said, ""Folks, sorry, you got to pay your fair share."" 16 years was going like this? The contribution, and now it's like a rocket ship, $100 billion. I said to him, great people, 28 nations, including the US, I said to him, ""Listen, we're taking care of you. You screw us on trade, and you don't pay your military bills. This is not a good deal for the United States."" So we're taking care of trade. We want to do it nice and slow and easy. You know, we got a world balance, but European Union is terrible to us on trade, terrible. Frankly, they're as tough or tougher than China, just smaller in numbers. That's the only difference. With China, 507 billion dollars, a you look over the years, for many, many years, they've been taken. And guys like Biden say, ""Uh-oh, We'd them them."" And he was there eight years, ""We'd stop that."" No, Trump is stopping it. Trump is stopping it. Representative Ayanna Pressle. Is she related in any way to Elvis? I don't know. Who knows? You never know. She thinks that people with the same skin color, all need to think the same or military. You know they're attacking a single man standing there with a camera, who never got hit and never hit back before in his life that. They're very brave. They always show up with a mask and they're covered. Because then they go home to mom and dad. They don't want mom and dad to know where they were. But they always attract people that really can't defend themselves very well. Right? They're attacking this group. They're not attack North Carolina. That's for sure. So these Congresswomen, their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left, but that's so, they are very evil. They're hitting people over the head with sticks, and I mean sticks. I mean bats even, they're whacking people with bats. They're very brave. They always show up with a mask and they're covered, because then they go home to mom and dad. They don't want mom and dad to know where they were. But they always attract people that really can't defend themselves very well. Right? They're attacking this group. They're not attack North Carolina. That's for sure. So these Congresswomen, their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant hard left, but that's okay, because we're going to win this election like nobody's ever seen before. And tonight I have a suggestion for the hate filled extremists, who are constantly trying to tear our country down. They never have anything good to say. That's why I say, ""Hey, if they don't like it, let them leave. Let them leave. Let them leave. Let them leave."" They're always telling us how to run it, how to do this, how to the… you know what? if they don't love it, tell them to leave it. I don't know. And I'll watch, I'll go back to the, ""Oh sir, that was so controversial, sir."" No, I'm just saying it's their choice. They can come back when they want, but you know, they don't love our country, I think in some cases they hate our country. And it's so angry, even yesterday they went on the stage. I said, ""Let me watch this."" And the anger, they were trying to be nice, but it's hard. It's hard for them to do that. That choice for every American has never been more clear. That's true. The Democrat agenda is anti worker, anti jobs, anti citizen anti-family and anti common sense. With the exception of all of those Democrats that voted for us today, we'll give them up, okay? They're fine, they're fine. They are fine and you'll lose to them, it's different. It's okay. It's called normal political back and forth. But I want to tell you something, the Democrats are being violent, so vicious, moving so far left, it's out of control. It's out of control. The Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100% pro-American. So we're thrilled tonight to be joined by several North Carolina Republican leaders. Really great people. They've been so helpful to me and they're doing an incredible job. Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest, Lieutenant Governor. North Carolina, Treasurer Dale Folwell. Greenville Mayor, PJ Connelly, I hear he does a good job, PJ. And North Carolina GOP Chair, Michael Whatley incredible NCAA wrestling champion, great guy. He wanted to stay back. I said, ""You sure you don't want to come?"" ""I do want to come, but I really want you to win today, if you don't mind."" I said, ""Okay, you better stay back. If I see you here I'm going to be very angry."" And they did their job, didn't they? This man is from the great state of Ohio, Congressman Jim Jordan. We're going to do this quickly, but it's just important that you get out and vote, they're two great people. I want to introduce the next member of Congress from North Carolina's third congressional district, just won a great race, Dr. Greg Murphy. Greg is a winner. So you know Greg would be great on jobs, all the things you want, tough on crime, strong on borders, pushing the wall, he'll be pushing it like nobody. We're building the wall but we're pushing it. It's like pulling teeth. We've got six lawsuits on the wall, we've won two of them, we're going to win others. But you think it's easy, don't you folks, you think this is easy? But we're building a lot of wall and we hope if we can win that final one, it's so important it's going before the Supreme Court, we'll have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. So go out, get Greg elected. Great victory, by the way, that was a great primary and a great victory. That same day there's another crucial election in North Carolina's 9th… Right, you know what we're talking about? 9th, I know it's not here, but it's very close, right? 9th Congressional district. The Democrat in the race is an ultra liberal named Dan McCready, he wants to take away your guns, he wants to raise you taxes, he doesn't care about borders, he likes open borders. And he really admires socialism, I don't think that works too well in North Carolina. Doesn't work too well in our country. We're joined tonight by the Republican candidate who is really a special man, a great man, he's going to be a great, great Congressman, Dan Bishop. Dan? Thank you, Dan. Thank you Dan. And he will indeed defend your values, your family, and he will always defend our second amendment unlike the opponents. They're really into destroying our second amendment. Who've been violently operating for more than 10 years, we got them all, we think they are no good. With conducting brutal, medieval style killings, you know what medieval style is? Okay. Little pieces, little pieces, little pieces, medieval style, including the dismemberment of their victims, and they enjoyed every minute of it. These are sick people. When I call them animals, Nancy Pelosi said, ""How dare he used that name? These are human beings."" I don't think they're human beings. Most of those indicted were in our country illegally, 19 to be exact, 19 of 22. Think of that, they want to protect… These are savage beasts, these are savage killers, and they should've been brought out a long time ago by the Obama administration. We're bringing MS-13 out by the thousands, getting them the hell out of our county. And when you read about deportation and Sunday, we've got a lot of people on Sunday, but we have a lot of people… and we're always shooting for the bad ones first. Which makes sense, right, but when you hear about that, we always want to get… And by the way, do you know how dangerous it is for these ICE agents, these ICE and border patrol? But ICE, they go into a nest, they call it a nest, a nest of these killers. They're tough, they're smart, and you know what, they're great patriots, they love our country. The danger that they have is incredible. And I just want to salute… and I have to tell you, I want to salute ICE and border patrol, and I want to support and salute law enforcement in the United States. These are great people. These are great people and they don't get the credit that they deserve, but you know what? I tell them all the time, you have no idea how much the American people, the American public, you have no idea how much they love you and respect you, law enforcement. In the recent democratic debate, every single candidate, everyone, Biden was a little bit slower with the hand, it didn't work so well. They raised their hand in favor of giving free government healthcare. They raised their hand in giving a lot of other things that I don't think you're going to be happy with, illegal aliens will be very nicely covered. How about California, they just approved a $100 million? They just approved $100 million to take care of the needs of illegal immigrants, and then you look on the sidewalks of Los Angeles, the sidewalks of San Francisco, Nancy Pelosi's district, nobody's ever seen anything like it in the history of our country what's happening there. So if you don't want Democrats to raid your healthcare, to steal away your money, to bankrupt your country, then you have a choice, you must vote Republican. All American citizens, including millions and millions of legal immigrants who work hard to come into our country, who study, who wait on line sometimes for 10 years, and who respect our laws and follow the rules, they deserve a government that is loyal to them. They work hard. You can't say you love our country if you want to destroy it through open borders, open borders are a disaster. Human trafficking, the first time I heard as a politician, human trafficking, nobody talks about it, it sounded almost like an ancient crime, many, many years ago, hundreds of years, thousands of years ago, human trafficking, it's the worst now throughout the world because of the Internet, it's the worst it's ever been. And the worst treated of all, children, but it's women, women, the Democrats want to do nothing about it. Human trafficking is worse than it ever has been in the history of the world, not just… This is not a United States problem, this is all over the world. Human trafficking, it's a terrible, terrible thing and we got to solve it. Most of it comes through, in this country, our southern border where we don't have the wall. They're not going through our points, they're not going through areas where we have security, where we have guards, where we have gates, where we have all sorts of equipment, no, they ride through the desert and they make a left where you don't have the wall. It's so simple, everybody knows it. The Democrats all know it because five years ago before I was here, they all wanted it. Now they don't want it, you know why they don't want it? For political reasons, and you know what, it's going to cost them a lot of points in the election, I think probably cost them the election itself. Just lastly, Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities which release violent criminal aliens onto our streets. Where we just picked up these 22 thugs, these 22 monsters, we just picked him up in, where, Los Angeles. Sanctuary city, wonderful sanctuary city. Thom Tillis senator recently introduced a bill to give American victims the right to pursue sanctuary cities and hold them accountable for the thousands of lives they have shattered, they've shattered these lives. Thank you very much Thom. Every nation has the right to establish and enforce immigration rules in it's national interest, it's very simple, isn't it? It's common sense, it's so simple and the voters understand that. We expect that those who seek to join our society will obey our laws, revere our constitution, cherish our history, support themselves financially, and embrace our American values and love our American flag. We believe in an immigration system based on merit, merit, where they come in. We have so many companies coming in, automobile companies, companies of all types, and we need workers. We actually need workers. We have the lowest unemployment rate that we've had in 51 years, soon it'll be the lowest ever. We need workers, but they have to come in where they can help our country. They have to come in based on merit, and we're putting in bills and let's see what happens. Otherwise, we'll just wait til we win back the house, win the Senate, win the Presidency, and we'll vote. Democrats have never been farther outside of the mainstream. They're going crazy folks, they're going crazy. More than 130 Democrats in Congress have signed up for Bernie Sanders total government takeover of healthcare, isn't that nice? This is one of the great… It won't happen, he knows that. The guy never passed the bill, he did nothing. He's actually not even a Democrat, isn't he an independent? I don't know, he's running but… He missed his time. Hey Bernie, let me save you a lot of time and effort, Bernie, you missed your time. It got taken from you four years ago, Bernie. Not doing too well. He's not doing too well, but that's okay. I got to hand it to him he's up there ranting and raving and going like a lunatic. I said to our first lady the other day, I was watching Bernie and he's screaming, his hair's all crazy, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that, no more college loans, no more cost for anything. Nothing, you're not going to pay for anything. He's desperate now, he's desperate. You don't have to pay for anything. I joke, I said, ""And everybody will get a free Rolls-Royce, every family gets a free Rolls-Royce, every family. And the media said, ""Donald Trump is exaggerating. He knows that they're not getting a Rolls-Royce."" I'm sorry, don't put it. Don't put that I said Free Rolls Royce. But Bernie's desperate now, I watch him up there it's a sad situation. But I think they're all sad when you get right down to it. For instance, we're in this incredible state North Carolina, that you have your best economy that you've ever had. Forget the country for a second, you have the best economy you've ever had, you have your best unemployment numbers, you had the most people working than at any time in the history of your state, you have your best black unemployment numbers, best Hispanic unemployment numbers, best women unemployment numbers, best Asian unemployment numbers. Whoever the opponent is, what are they going to do is just say, ""North Carolina, I'm going to do a great job. You have the best numbers in the history of our country in your state, so I don't know, and we won by a lot. And we won by a lot I was telling Mike, I was telling my son Eric Trump and Lara's here, y the way, who was born in North Carolina. They do a good job. Lara, do you love this state? And her brother's here, I have to tell you, he went to this college. And Brad Parscale is here, the worlds tallest campaign manager in the history of the world. He's the tallest in the history, but most importantly, he's the best. The worlds tallest manager but he's the best manager. Thank you, Brad. Great job. And he just told me our poll numbers are through the roof, he just told me that so I'll take that. We are a year and a half away, but we're doing well, you see it. You'd know, you'd be the first to know. Number one, you wouldn't be here, you wouldn't be here. We haven't had an empty seat in any event, I don't believe, that we've ever been to, I don't think we've ever had… we always have people, we haven't had an empty seat. You look anywhere, North Carolina, Ohio, no matter where we go we pack it and we have thousands and thousands of people, we put screens outside. I know tonight's not so good, we got a hundred degrees out, but you still have thousands of people out there. We could have sold this arena out, you know that. We could have sold this arena out tonight 10 times, can you believe that? 10 times. I think that's like a poll, that's like a poll because when Biden goes out I see Sleepy Joe and he says, ""They had 115 people show up, 115 people. That's our first row."" The democratic record on healthcare is one of deception and destruction, the last administration said a lie. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, 28 times, a total lie. My administration is defending your sacred right to choose the doctor and the plan that you want, and we are offering plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare, and a lot of people are starting to figure that out. Better healthcare. And we'll also always protect… You have to remember this, you ready, because they give us a bum rap. Patients with preexisting conditions are protected by Republicans much more so than protected by Democrats who will never be able to pull it off. Preexisting conditions, and you know, the job we've done on healthcare, it's not talked about, but we're also doing something. It's been phenomenal, we have 180 million people right now really happy on private plans, and you know what, they're going to be taken away. Under the Democrats plan all of those people that are thrilled where they went out and negotiated cross state lines, all of the things they did, they went out, negotiated great private plans, it's all going to be taken away from you under this plan. Now, I only hope they don't change because we're talking too soon, we got a year and a half left. It's like when I called Pocahontas, Pocahontas, I should've waited six months because she then went out and got that test. 1024th, and I've always said I have more Indian blood in me than she has in her, and I have none. I have none, but it's more than she has, 1024. I brought it up too soon so I don't talk about it anymore, but if she should be the candidate, which I tend to doubt, but if she should be we'll bring it up again and I think it will be very successful. 1024, how about this, I was driving her crazy, so she went out and hired a guy to check the blood. I'm sure he had a lot of fun doing that. He checked her blood and found out that many, many, many, many, many, many years ago, there could have been somebody and he could have been Indian. And then the Indians got together and they said, ""We don't want her."" We want Trump, we want Trump, they want Trump. We've taken historic action to fight the opioid epidemic, what a problem, and just today it was just announced before I came in, that drug overdose deaths… we're working so hard on this, including our vice president, including our first lady, including everybody in the Trump administration, it's dropped for the first time in more than 30 years, it's gone down. First time, it was a big problem. And in North Carolina and we're far from finished, it's a big problem, it declined 8% last year. That's a lot because it was just going up like a rocket. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. Well then you have the gentleman from… our governor from Virginia, so we're talking about late term, he's talking about the baby is born before the mother makes the decision. That's the first I've heard of it, that's the first most of you have heard of it, and then they pass legislation in various states saying that's okay. This is a baby that's born, this isn't late term. This is a baby that's born. Nobody's ever heard anything like that, nobody's ever seen anything like it. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. And that actually, when he had the scandal, that became, can you believe it? The second biggest story. Can you believe that, how important it is and yet that was the second biggest story, and what a shame when that's the second biggest story. What happened to our values? Republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift of God. That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion of babies. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion intolerance and division. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans and American values. We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream. This is the proud banner the Republican Party will carry into the Republican National Convention next summer in the great city of Charlotte, North Carolina. Don't disappoint me, that should be good for at least 10 points, right? These are some of the greatest ladies, I see them in Ohio, and Florida. We love you too, thank you, really. How many have you been to, just out of curiosity? What's the number? All but two, I've done hundreds of them. And then they say women don't like Trump, I think they do. Now I see them, they're great. Great ladies, you're great. It's interesting with women, so women want to have a strong military protection, they want to have strong borders, they want to have strong law enforcement, they want to have great education, they want to have low taxes for their family, not high taxes. They want to have all the things that we talk about, why wouldn't they want Trump more than anybody else? The other side is going to go the opposite. And they did in the last election, and we're doing a lot better. The difference is, the last election I was a successful businessman running for president, I said I was going to do things. And by the way, really successful. I'm going to show you something someday soon, I'm going to show you something. They say he was really successful, he wasn't successful, he's really smart, or he's really stupid but he's trying to take over the world. They have so many messages, he's really stupid, then next week, Donald Trump has a sinister plot to take over the world, he can't be too stupid, because they actually think it's working. I saw one of these so-called comedians the other day and he's a pretty respected comedian, he said, he's not leaving. I'm telling you, he's not leaving, he'll never live. He'll win this election and in 24′, I'm telling you, he's not leaving. He's going to stay. So we did through our friend Dan Scavino, we did a Time Magazine cover. I was on so many times, I don't even read this thing, and it says, Trump, 2014, 2018. But it says 20 here's where we go, we start at 16, we go to 20, we go to 24, did you see it? Then it says 28, 32, 36, 40, 42. No, we don't need any more time. We don't need any more time, we need one more. A senator came to my office, sir, I'm six foot seven, I'm great. I'm six foot seven so I can give you great advice. I said, ""Senator, I'm one for one but it happened to be the president."" And now I want to be two for two, two for two. Two for two, so we have 16, we have 20, we have 24, and you know what's very interesting though? They were really people out there think I'm not leaving, can you believe it? Hey, maybe that is a good idea, let's think about it. Watch, you want to drive them crazy, they're going to go crazy. All I have to do is say, ""Let's think about it. They're going to go crazy. No, I promise 2024, I leave. By that time, just so you know, by that time our country will be so well seated, it will be so strong like never, ever, in our history. But everything that we built, low taxes, strong military, taking care of our vets, all of the things we've done can be decimated very quickly if the wrong person gets in especially now. I've always said 2016 was the most important election maybe in the history of our country, a lot of people felt that. So I don't know, I can't say this is more important, what we did was a miracle. Not to us it wasn't, but a lot of people said it was the greatest election we've ever had. There's never been anything like it, never been such excitement. Never been such excitement. But you know what, if we don't win in 2020 everything that we've done, seriously though, everything that we've done, your 401's are going to crash, the whole thing, it's going to come down like a stack of cards. So, in a certain way, let's say this is of equal importance, by that time we'll have values instilled, we'll have free enterprise instilled, people are working now. We have the lowest food stamps that we've had in many years, lowest food stamps because people are working. So I really think it's at least equal, it's equal, maybe it's a little less, who the hell knows? I just know this, it can disappear very, very quickly. We have to get out, we have to vote. That's why I'm starting early, can you believe it? We have less… I see all these clowns on television I say I guess we have to counteract them a little bit, but this is not what you want running, none of them, this is not what you want running this incredible country of ours. Every day we make good on the motto, promises made, promises kept. I've had people back there that don't like me and somebody said, very nicely, that he's actually made certain promises and he's actually kept more promises than he's made. It's true. I've done things that I never… I never said we were going to get, as an example with our vets, that we going to get, Joyce, that we were going to have the ability to fire people that don't treat our vets properly. We can fire them now. They've been trying to get that for 44 years, Joyce had been trying to get practically from the beginning, Joyce's so simple and yet they never got it, nobody got it through. We're good at getting things through. We've done more than we said we would. A man I know, who I don't like, a businessman, very, very, very successful, one of the most successful but I don't like him, never liked him. He never liked me, by the way. In fact, I would go a step further, he cannot stand me. And I saw him about two months ago and he came up to me, I said, ""How are you doing?"" Very warm, hey, how you doing? Let's get out of here. And he said, ""I'm doing good, you're doing good?"" I said, ""Yeah."" I said, ""You don't like me, and I don't like you. I never have liked you, and you never have liked me, but you're going to support me because you're a rich guy. And if you don't support me you're going to be so goddamn poor you're not going to believe it."" And he said to me, ""Mr. President."" He calls me Mr. President, everybody calls me Mr. President, it's true, it's a funny thing. He said, ""Mr. President, you're right, I'm supporting you, I think you're doing a great job. And maybe we didn't get along."" But it's not like he has a choice, he has no choice. And on top of that, it's a good choice because we've done the right thing. And it is funny with the name Mr. President, I have friends, really good friends, and they've always called me Don, Donald, D, they call me anything, and you lose all your friends when you're president because they're all afraid to talk to you, does that make sense? No, it's true. Except for these six, seven, ladies up here, they always talk. They're not intimidated. No, it's true, I have guys, I have wonderful friends, New York developers, tough guys, smart guys, they're rich, they're this, that. I have middle of the road, I have poor, I have everybody. I have poor guys, middle of the road, and rich guys, doesn't matter. Rich guys call up, ""Mr. President, how are you sir? It's Richard."" Oh, good, Rich, hey Richard, loosen up. This is a guy who used to, ""Hey Don, how you doing? Let's go to dinner."" Now you're, ""Sir, is everything… you're doing good, sir."" I said, ""Richard, call me Donald like you always did, call me Donald. Always call me Donald."" Okay, thank you Donald, thank you very much. And then two minutes later, Mr President, it's been so great to… I lost all my friends. They've tightened up, they've choked. You know what that is, they choked. They can't breathe because people have such respect for the office of the presidency, they have respect for the office of the president. They have respect for our country again, our country is respected again. We've confirmed more than 125 federal judges to apply the law as written, including two supreme court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs, and last year, I'm so proud of this because we have no help from the Democrats. Last year, for the first time in over 50 years, drug prices went down. And that was for a reason. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed groundbreaking, criminal justice reform. It's a big thing, prisoners they've gotten out of jail and they never had an economy like this. We did a lot of things, because they get out jail they don't have a chance. They always go back, most of the time. Now they're coming out and we have programs, but most of all we have this great economy where people are hiring prisoners, and you have to see the reviews they're getting, they getting phenomenal reviews. It's a beautiful thing, it's a beautiful thing what's happening with prisoners, they get out and they can actually get a job and that's what's happening and we're very proud of them. We're expanding opportunities zone so that no American is left behind, it's one of the great successes the opportunity zones. Nobody talks about it, it's one of the great successes. And thanks to our pledge to America's workers, private sector partners will provide apprenticeships and job training to 9 million Americans, isn't that nice? Whenever I hear that word apprentice, I say I love that word, that was a good show. They figured, you know what we'll do, we'll get Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place, that didn't work out too well. That didn't work out too well, we had 14 seasons, think of that, The Apprentice. I've proudly signed for bi-partisan human trafficking laws securing $400 million dollars to support victims of human trafficking. And we have secured, soon to be three years, record funding for our military. We want to cut budgets, but this is beyond budget. I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided, disgusting Iran nuclear deal, and Iran is a different country today than it was. My administration proudly recognized the true capitol of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. That was some day, they all said, ""Many, many presidents have said, ""We're going to do it."" Then they never did."" I know why, because the pressure on them was enormous not to do it. And then on top of it, a couple of months ago, I just approved the Golan Heights for Israel. The Golan Heights, another thing. 52 years they tried to do that, they didn't get it done, so we're doing good. We also recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and we condemn those that want to stop freedom in that country and other countries. Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country, will never, ever, be a socialist country, it just won't happen. A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream. Frankly, the destruction of our country, that's what's going to happen. Take a look around, their party is afflicted with an ideological sickness that protects foreign borders, but refuses to protect our own borders. Think of it, they fight all over though a lot of those people are coming back home folks, they're coming back home a lot. We defeated ISIS, the Caliphate in Syria, we're bringing our soldiers back home. ISIS does not like me too much, but I came here and it was a mess. It was a mess. I met with generals, general believe it or not, one general, his name is Raisin. I said, ""What's your name?"" Sir. This guy's like out of a movie. Watch, he's going to be famous after this but who cares? What's your name? And he goes, ""Sir, my name is Raisin."" I said, ""Raisin, like you mean a little raisin?"". Yes sir, it's my name, that's what they call me. What's your last name? Kane. I said, ""You mean your name is Raisin Kane?"" I said, Raisin Kane, you're my kind of general. Let me talk to you Raisin Kane, get over here."" And my previous general said, ""It's going to be a long time before we take out the caliphate."" I said, did Raisin Kane and a couple of other generals that were there, these guys are central casting like from a movie, except better. They're stronger, bigger, tougher, meaner, and actually better looking in a certain way. But they're like from a movie, there is nobody in Hollywood plays a role like this. I said, ""Generals, I've been told it's going take a year, two years, to get a 100%."" Remember I want to pull them out, we're down to 1%, and everyone went crazy, explain that one. But they said it was going to take a long time. I said to Raisin Kane and the other generals, ""General, how long can it take? They said, ""Sir, one month."" I said, ""What?"" We're going to hit them from the front, we're going to hit them from the back, we're going to hit them from the, sir, we're going to hit them like they never got hit before, we were never allowed to do this. And we're not just going to hit them from our temporary base in Syria, sir, we're going to hit him from Iraq, we're going to hit them from places that they never knew existed, sir. They'll be hit so Goddamn hard sir, they will be… Thank you very much. Very shortly, very, very shortly, it was over, we had a 100% of the Caliphate, and these people we're screwing around for years. Obama, President Obama. My generals did a great job, I flew there, I flew to Iraq, remember? I'm an Air Force One and they notified me, ""Sir, we're 45 minutes out, sir. We have to close all windows, we have to turn off all lights in the plane, sir. All windows, all lights have to be off, sir. We're turning off the lights outside and the runway light, sir. They going to be in a very dim""… Frankly, if you're not at 30-year old pilot you can't see them, because I went there, I said, ""I don't see any light pilot."" As we're landing, I said, ""I don't see."" And then I thought to myself, think of it, we've spent almost $8 trillion in the Middle East and we got to turn off the lights of an airplane to land, how bad is that? They didn't do their job. We did our job, and the military did their job. But we fight to short of just keep going, we don't fight to win, I fight to win. I fight to win. So we land in this big, beautiful Air Force One and I'm saying, ""Major, I don't see a runway."" Yes sir, it's right up ahead, the guy's 30 years old or something. They'll get me that, they'll say majors aren't 30, maybe he's 35 whatever he is. They're saying, ""Yes sir, it's right there."" I don't see it major, how about lifting up, let's go around. That's the last thing we want to do in that part of the world. He said, ""Sir, it's right there, sir."" And we're landing and I still haven't seen a light. But these guys, we have the greatest pilots in the world, we have the greatest military in the world, we have the greatest equipment in the world. So you must never forget the 2020 election is all about one thing, you. It's about you. It's about your family, it's about your future, and the fate of your beautiful, loving, country, and that's what it is. We begin our North Carolina campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nation's future. We love our nation, our nation is great today. It's going to be much greater, every year it's getting better, and better. We have turned this big, beautiful, mighty ship, we have turned it around, it's getting better, better, better. Together we will continue on unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can know the dignity of work and the pride of a paycheck positive vision for our nation's future. We love our nation, our nation is great today. It's going to be much greater, every year it's getting better, and better. We have turned this big, beautiful, mighty ship, we have turned it around. It's getting better, better, better. Together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can know the dignity of work and the pride of a paycheck. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress, those great gentlemen that just left the stage. To create a safe, modern, fair and lawful system of immigration, we will enact trade deals and they are going like you won't even believe. That doesn't mean the other countries are thrilled with me, there was a recent poll, Germany likes Obama better than Trump. A lot better. I said, ""Of course, because I'm making them pay their bills."" I'm saying you got to pay. I say, ""Anguilla, Anguilla, you got to pay, Anguilla."" Obama would go in, make a speech, leave. I go in and make a speech, I say, Let me speak to Anguilla. Anguilla you got to pay your bills, you're way behind."" So I would think that they should, they should all like… When you hear they like me better, I'm not doing my job. It's true, I'm not doing my job. They did a poll on one of these networks, and they would say, ""Donald Trump is not liked in Europe nearly as much as President Obama."" I said, ""Or President Bush, or anybody."" In fact I'm disliked, but actually they respect us, that's more important. Look at that beautiful baby, look at that beautiful baby. Wow, what a baby? What a baby? That is a beautiful baby. That's like from an advertisement, perfect. Look how happy that baby is, so beautiful. Thank you darling, that's really nice. It's a great thing, is that your husband? That's a great thing, thank you. Congratulations husband. What a picture? But we're going to have the country all set for your child, okay? Awesome, because that's what it's about. Now the media will say that's a prop, they say no baby is so beautiful. That had to be a set up. I never saw that guy in my life, which is true. Thank you. Good luck. Thank you very much. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those four beautiful words, made in America, made in the USA, either one is okay with me. Keep America great, that's right. We will give school choice to millions of underserved children who are trapped in failing government schools. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. They're going to take your guns away. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one great nation, as one America. It's one America. We believe in the American constitution and we believe in the rule of law, we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children, like your child, should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, ""In God we trust."" We are fighting for every American mom and dad who wants to protect this land of liberty for their precious children. We have been blessed with the greatest republic on the face of the earth, but it was going in the wrong direction, and now we are turning it around, it is going better than ever before and we going to keep it that way. We're going to keep it that way. With your help, with your devotion, with your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning. We are one movement, one movement, think of that, we are one big beautiful movement. There has never been a movement like this, you don't hear it that often. They know it but you don't hear… In the history of our country, there has never been a movement like this, and this movement is stronger now than it was three years ago. This is the strongest movement in the history of our country. But we are, we're one movement, we're one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. We're doing things that nobody thought was possible, no other nation thought it was possible what we're doing. We are so respected, you have no idea how our nation has gone so far up in the eyes and the minds of the rest of the world. So respected. Because together, we will make America wealthy again, of course, we did just hit the highest price in the history of the market. So pretty soon, and I hate to say, I don't want to ruin the rhetorical skill, but that is sort of like getting a little obsolete, we will make our nation wealthy again. The fact is we have the strongest stock market in our history, so I think I'll have to change it. You've all heard it many times, right, we will make America wealthy again, we're going to have to say, ""We have made America wealthy again."" So here's one, we will make America strong again. No, no, we're going to have to change this, we have made America strong again. And just so you know, we have made America great again. Give up MAGA. How do you give up MAGA? Make America great again, but we've done that. Can you imagine if keep America great didn't work? I had the greatest phrase probably in the history of politics in this country. Look at her beautiful hat, it looks very good on you. But look at this, look at those beautiful hats. Make America great again, but we've done that. Our new phrase for the 2020 campaign is, ""Keep America Great."" Thank you."
Trump,"Thank you, thank you. Wow. Wow, and I'm thrilled to be here with you in Henderson. Thousands of loyal, hard-working, great American patriots. And 51 days from now, we're going to win Nevada, and we're going to win four more years in the White House. And after we win four more years, we'll ask for maybe another four or so. Well, thank you very much. Whenever I say that … Look at all that news back there, look at all that fake news. When I say that, their heads explode. Our movement is pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-police, and 100% pro-American. As we begin tonight, our thoughts are with the two sheriff's deputies in Los Angeles who were fighting for their lives when a vicious criminal walked up to their vehicle and shot them at point blank range. Tonight, we send our love and our support to their families, and we pray to God for their recovery. The radical left in America is waging open war on law enforcement. Hundreds of officers nationwide have been injured in left-wing riots and mobs. You see it, you see it all the time. Please, sit down. Please, let's have a little fun. We got plenty of time. I mean, here it is. I mean, what do we have? Football is boring as hell. It's just not the same. Right? I don't know. Used to be people would say, ""Hey, could you keep it away from a football game?"" Now they're saying, ""Could you possibly do it during the football game?"" We have some free time. But during violent demonstrations in Las Vegas, a 29-year-old police officer, you know this very well, was deliberately shot in the head, leaving the young, brave officer paralyzed, yet, Sleepy Joe Biden and his supporters continue their dangerous war on the police. They're putting the lives of our brave officers directly in harm's way. At his convention, he never even mentioned the words, ""law and order"", never mentioned them once. Now, he's all of a sudden, his polls are dropping like a rock, and he's starting to say, ""But we need law and order."" And then he goes back into the basement for four days. What happens to this guy? I know what happens to him. He's shot. That's what happened to him. Every once in a while, the great Dana White … Does anybody know Dana White? He's got some champions with him tonight. He's here. I got to introduce him. But every once in a while, I'll ask him, ""What happened to that guy?"" He said, ""Sir, he's been shot for the last … long time."" Should have left a long time ago. That's Joe Biden. Joe Biden, he's shot, and everybody knows it. And you know what? They ought to be ashamed, because they do interviews with him, they give him the questions, and they let him read the answer from a teleprompter, and that's the fake news. It is. How about the other day? Could you move that a little bit closer. See these things? Move it a little bit. I must tell you at great peril, I used them seldom, but those are the times we have the best fun too, I will say. And that's actually when we learn the most. For the entire summer, Biden was silent as left-wing mobs assaulted police officers. When Biden's far-left supporters set fire to police cars and precinct stations, court houses, Joe Biden called them peaceful protestors. Right? They call them peaceful protestors. And when we go to these radical-left place that are having problems, because everyone … look at the top-10. You go back … go top-20, top-30. Take a look. Democrat-run, radical left-wing, Democrat, usually run. Not Republican-run, Democrat-run. And we go back, and we take a look. We want to give them help. They don't want help. But when they do ask for help, and when they do, we go in. Like Minneapolis, the National Guard went in, took 35 minutes to quell a situation that went on for two weeks. They knew we were going in to Seattle. We told them, ""We're going in tomorrow morning."" And so, they sent them in. They didn't want that to happen, and we let the protestors know, or whatever you call them. They're really anarchists, they're not protestors. So we let the anarchists know that we were going in with approximately 10,000 very tough people, and they immediately raised their hands, and the Seattle police, who by the way, could do a great job if they were let to do their job, but they're not, they're not. And as you know, in Portland, the other day, we had to send in the US Marshalls. A man, who's a bad guy, bad guy, shot somebody right in the middle of the street, who they say was a very fine young man. Shot him, killed him. Just shot him like … It was on television. Two-and-a-half days, nothing happened. I said, ""What's going on?"" We sent in the US Marshalls. It was taken care of in 15 minutes. Okay? 15 minutes. When asked if he would cut police funding, Sleepy Joe said, ""Absolutely, yes, I would."" Now he's trying to change his mind. You ever see a guy … He changed his mind on fracking. Okay? ""There will be no fracking."" You know that? He went all throughout the debates. He doesn't even know what fracking is, I guarantee you. He was told to say that by Bernie and the radical left and his vice president. By the way, how bad is she? She is the worst. We're going to have a woman president some day. Not going to be her, not going to be her. And that's no way to attain the office. We got in there because Sleepy Joe couldn't handle it anymore. Joe is bad primetime. See, the reason I can talk so badly about him, because he did an ad, where he had me standing over the grave and the graves of our fallen heroes from many years ago, and they said … And nobody loves the military more. Look what I've done for them, $2.5 trillion. And in the ad, they have me saying horrible things in front of other people. Nobody would have put up with that. It's called disinformation. They make up a total lie, they put it out, then they do ads. So once he did that, I said, ""Now, really, look, it's okay. It's okay, because now the gloves are off."" I can say that this man is totally unfit to be president. Up here, he's totally unfit. He can't be your president. I've gotten to know President Xi of China. I've gotten to know President Putin of Russia. And by the way, getting along with them is good. Although China, I must tell you, got a real problem with China. What they did with us, we can never forget that. We made a great trade deal. The ink wasn't dry when the plague came in from China. They stopped it from going into China, but they didn't stop it from going into our country, Europe and the rest of the world. Okay? They could have done that. But you see, I deal with all of these people, and they don't have the kind of mental problem that Sleepy Joe has. They're very sharp. Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un doesn't know about the problems that Joe has. We need very sharp people. I'm sorry. Joe is not qualified for this position. Joe calls for abolishing cash bail and closing your prisons. He wants to close prisons, and he even called law enforcement the enemy recently. You saw that? The enemy, until his polls started dropping. Then all of a sudden, he said, ""No, we love law enforcement."" I think I've gotten every major law enforcement group in the country, right? You saw recently, I got New York's finest. And they are New York's finest, but they're not allowed to do their job. They're not allowed. We have a radical left mayor who has no clue. He has no clue what's happening to that poor city. I love that city. What's happening to that city. 300% up. Look, 300% in certain very bad crimes, New York. There's no reason for this, and we have the greatest police. They're great. New York's finest, they endorsed me. Chicago, Fraternal Order of Police. Chicago endorsed me, Oklahoma endorsed me, Texas endorsed me, Florida endorsed me. Every place endorsed me. And if you think it's easy for New York and Chicago and these different places … Ohio endorsed me. If you think it's easy for these guys. They never endorse. New York, they said they cannot remember ever having endorsed a presidential candidate. They endorsed me, and they're against their radical left culture that's destroying the city. So I was very honored. But how about Chicago? Do you think it's easy for these great police in Chicago to endorse me? It's not easy, but they felt that they had an obligation to do it. So it just happened. I'm just very honored by it. And Biden's anti-police crusade must stop. It's got to stop, it's got to stop now. Furthermore, the corporations, these poor, stupid people that run the … They got paid a lot of money. They're weak, ineffective people, let's face it. They're funding anti-police organizations and other organizations that are … It's so embarrassing. And I don't mean for a little. They gave $100 million and 250 … You're talking about serious money. You're talking about serious money, and that money is not used for good reasons. And these stupid corporations … and they'll be the first to go if the radical left ever took … They'd throw those guys out like they were nothing. If they were lucky, they'd just be thrown out. It would probably be a lot rougher than that. These people don't know what they're getting into. But instead of giving money, they should give money to the families of the crime victims and the fallen officers. That's what they should do. So in the Republican Party, we know that police officers are not villains, but the heroes who risk their lives to keep us safe. And they guard … The thing that's incredible … I know so many police, they're so good, one bad apple, and they're on for months. One bad apple, they go on for months. The thousands and tens of thousands of good things, nobody talks about it. These are great people that have done a great job, and we have to support our law enforcement. So Biden wants to appease the domestic terrorists, and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists. Okay? And we also believe that if you murder a police officer, you should receive the death penalty, and that's something that's very important fine people. I mean, they're in very grave condition, as you know. Fine people. He's an animal, and I called him an animal, and I was criticized by people, calling him an animal. They said he's a human being. He's not a human being. He's an animal. He's not a human being. Joe Biden opposes the death penalty even for cops who … I mean, look, you have to see, even for these cop killers who go around, the predators, they murder children. People like the Boston bomber. He opposes the death penalty for the Boston bomber. He wants to give prisoners a vote. He wants to have the Boston bomber be able to vote. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. You know who's thought of that? Bernie Sanders, Crazy Bernie. He wants to have … Crazy Bernie, he says, ""No, no, they have to vote."" So they asked him, ""Well, does that mean every … "" That means everybody that's in prisons should be entitled to a vote, right? So they actually said, ""Well, what about the Boston bomber? Should he entitled?"" And Bernie goes, ""Yeah, he should be entitled."" Bernie is crazy. But the fact is, that we got a lot of Bernie votes four years ago, because Bernie's right about one thing, trade. Because all of these countries, friend and foe, they ripoff the United States. We have made so many great trade deals, and you see it, USMCA. We got rid of NAFTA. So many. But Biden is too weak to be president, and he's not a smart person. And by the way, he wasn't smart 25 years ago. Everybody knew it. Now we don't even have to discuss the matter. But I was going to say, when he put that ad up, we told him to take it down. When he put that ad up, that dishonored our fallen heroes. They are great, great heroes of mine, of yours, of everybody's. I know really bad people. No bad person, the worst person I know, I know some beauties from New York. I know some developers in New York actually. Nobody would say what they said. They made it up. It was a made up statement, and they put it up in the form an ad, from a third-rate magazine, who's best friend is Obama, who, by the way, got caught spying on my campaign. He got caught. We caught him cold. We have him cold. Now let's see what happens. Now the Republicans, it's interesting, we have much better policy, but the Republicans, they don't fight like Colby. You know who Colby is. You're going to say hello to Colby. They don't fight like Colby. They don't fight to win. Better policy, but they don't have that vicious streak. If this were reversed, they would be in jail for two years already, and it would be for a 50-year term for treason. That's what it would be. Okay? But Biden's too scared to stand up to the crazy socialists and never will. He'll never have the strength, and he's going downhill fast. It's going to be very interesting. And I called for a drug test, because you know what? I want a drug test, because we don't want to have a situation like we could have with this guy. I watched him in debates with other 24 lunatics, and he was so bad. No, he was so bad. Maybe he'll win because they don't like me, they don't like my personality. But I hate to say it, I'm what you need. I'm what you need. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. But if Biden ever did win, he would surrender your country to the mob. You know that. And he will have nothing to do with it. It's not him. I mean, he's being … He's going to be pushed around. And she's, by the way, just so you know what you're going to get. She's considered far more liberal than Bernie Sanders. How about that? That's what you're going to have. I don't think your state is into that. Unlike Biden, I'll always stand with the heroes of law enforcement. And I'm deeply honored to have gotten all of those endorsements. That to me is a really big deal. That to me is really a big deal. And I just want to thank all of them, including the National Troopers Association and Coalition just came in. We also received the endorsement, total and complete endorsement from the Public Safety Alliance of Nevada, and the Las Vegas Police Protective Association from Nevada. And I want to thank for that, Steve Grammar, who's with us tonight. Where's Steve? Was Steve here? Steve, thank you. Thank you. That's a big deal. Make sure they get out and vote, Steve, because they're playing around with the ballots. Okay? You know your governor. So we had many sites, by the way, all exterior sites, all outside. Today, you'll hear these phoneys back there. Well, look at that. Now today you're going to hear them. They'll say, ""Oh, it was in …"" Well, the reason it was, we had five sites, all outside sites, like last night. Tremendous room. And a great gentleman who owns this building said, ""You know what? What they're doing is really unfair. You can use my building, Don. I want to thank you, Don."" I want to thank you. This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, two agendas for the future. Joe Biden has spent the last 47 years selling out America. Look at what he's done. Everything he's done was wrong. He always voted the wrong way. Even his secretary of defense, his secretary of state, they said he always voted the wrong way. He was off shoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, depleting our military, and sacrificing your children's future to China and other faraway lands. I've spent the last four … He says … Only in Nevada can you have … I would never say it. What did you say? Okay. This way I can't get in trouble. I've spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to America, securing our borders, rebuilding our military, and standing up to China like no other president has ever done. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins the rioters and anarchists, and … Look, you see what's going on. The arsonists and flag burners. How about the flag burning? I would love- I would love to have a law … This is so sad what's going on. When I see the American flag burn, I get so angry. I get so angry. I would love to have a law. It has to go through a big process. You burn the flag, you go to jail for one year. I would love to see it. I would love to see it. I would love to see it. I would love to see it. If I were a Congressman or Senator, I'd be in there with that one. You know, they'll say, ""Oh, freedom of speech."" That's not freedom of speech. You burn the flag, you should go to jail for one year. I really mean that. They'll say, ""Oh, it's horrible. He's against free speech."" No, no, we're not. We're not against free speech. But I'm running for reelection to bring back the tremendous prosperity that we enjoyed before the plague came in, and it's happening very fast. And I'm running for your state. I love this state. You know, I put a lot of money in this state and it's been a great investment. And we want to keep this state strong. Not for that reason, by the way, for other reasons, because this is a great place. You have a governor right now who's a political hack. We want to put violent criminals behind bars. And tell you governor to open up your state, by the way. Open up your state. You know, just so you know, these shutdowns, we did the right thing. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. They came in, they … We were all seeing what was happening. We closed up. I mean, you know, you're presiding over the greatest economy in history and a group of very smart people walk in and say, ""Sir, we have to close it."" And we did the right thing. We closed it. Well, actually he didn't think we should close it yet. But later on, he said, ""We did the right thing."" We closed it. We closed it. We saved millions of lives. If we wouldn't have closed it, we would've been talking two and a half or three million. We're at 180. It's far too much. But we would have been talking about … It would've been unacceptable, unsustainable. It would've been so bad. Think of it. We're at 180,000. Other countries are doing terribly. Did you see the statistics of us compared to other countries? Us compared to Europe? We have done an incredible job. We get absolutely no credit for the job we've done. And I don't want it myself, but I want it for the admirals and the generals and Mike Pence. And Joe Biden was against it. Remember? He was totally against closing. He said, ""Oh, he's xenophobic."" I'm xenophobic? I wanted it closed and nobody else did. At that time, nobody else did. I was way early. You know, they say, ""He didn't act fast."" I was months early. Nancy Pelosi was a month and a half later saying, ""Come to Chinatown. Let's come to Chinatown."" And Sleepy Joe was totally … He thought what I was doing was terrible. Then all of a sudden, now I see him saying, ""He should have closed it earlier."" This guy … You know, the great thing about the age in which we live? It's all down in tape. It's all down. I got a reel on him. We call it Biden's Best. You got to hear this. But we want to ensure the future of America, not the future of China and other countries, because if we win, America wins, and it's all about America first. You've had presidents, they never put America first. They didn't put America first. They didn't take care of our country, but we're taking care of our country. Now, Joe Biden cannot lead our country because he really doesn't believe, truly, in our country. But I think that's a very strong statement. I don't think he has a clue. I'll be honest. The people that push him around don't believe in our country, because he agreed to a manifesto with crazy Bernie, right? It's called the manifesto. You know why it's called the manifesto? Because this is beyond socialism. This is a word that starts with a C, not and S. That's where they're coming from. That's where they're coming from. At Biden's convention they decried America wicked. And they were saying it's wicked sinful. It's destined for a fate of doom and despair. That was, by the way, that was the most depressing convention. We had a great convention. We had a great convention. They actually said that America wasn't great. They actually said that America was never great. You know who said that? Cuomo, the governor of New York, said America wasn't great. I don't know if he's going to get away with that one. That's going to haunt him. That's going to haunt him. America wasn't great. Him and his brother, Fredo. You ever watch Fredo? His ratings aren't very good, so you probably don't. But we know the truth. America's the most exceptional nation on Earth. And our destiny is blessed by God. We love this nation with all of our heart and soul, and we will always take care of our nation. You know, we have a little expression, ""Make America Great Again."" That's what's happened. And you know, we had it done. Now I say, ""Make America Great Again, Again."" Comma. I go comma again. And that's what we're doing at a record clip. They've never had a clip like this with the jobs and everything else. You see the numbers. On November 3rd, Nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, and we're doing it. We're going to have a tremendous year next year. Or whether we'll allow Joe Biden and the group of handlers to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, ban American energy, destroy our suburbs, demolish our second amendment, and indoctrinate your children with a poisonous anti-American lie. Yeah. Get him out of here, would you please? Under my leadership we built the greatest economy in the world. He's going home to mom. And now we're doing it again. We're developing a vaccine in record time. The other administration would have been years, and we're almost there. It's going to be announced very soon. We'll be ready before the end of the year. And we will very easily defeat the China virus. That's what's happening. And we're already making that turn. We're making that round beautiful last turn, but it should have never happened. China should have never let that happen. They should have stopped it in China. Under my administration, before the virus, we quickly achieved the lowest unemployment rate in Nevada's history. And we'll soon be there again. You see what's happening. A guy like Biden would totally eradicate Nevada's economy. He would make it impossible for you to compete. And he's already said if the doctor suggested, he would shut down the country again. We're not shutting down our country. A shutdown we'll destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of American. Look the Americans, you know, on the other side if you look at these shutdowns, and you're living through it right now. You know, there aren't many states that are shut down. They're all Democrats. North Carolina, your state. But North Carolina, we're not … You take a look at North Carolina. Pennsylvania shut down. Every one of them that are shut down are doing not well. They're not doing well. And they all have Democrat governors. And you know, when you look at the suicide rates, when you look at all of the suicide, all of the domestic violence, the drugs, all of the problems, we can't have it. We can't have it. Open up your state. You got to open up your state. It's all political. It's all political. It's all political. On November 4th, they'll announce, ""We're going to open up the states."" They're only doing it to affect your November 3rd great election. Most important election. Biden will always do whatever the radical left demands. And if elected, his radical supporters won't just be causing mayhem on the streets. They'll be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security. And by the way, the United States Supreme Court. And we will have a very different country. You know, the next president probably will have anywhere one, two, three, or four Supreme Court justices. If you want your second amendment, if you want life, if you want so many other things, even having to do with your military, even having to do with your vets, if you want things, if you want, you've got to have the court. Because they'll last for 25, 30, 40 years. They're put on as young people and they stay a long time. Our country will never be the same. We'll never be able to recover from it. So you got to get out on November 3rd or early voting. You got to get out and vote. And you could send your ballot, and then you have to check that your ballot's counted because they might not count your ballot in this state. They may not count your ballot. But we're looking to save and we're going to save America. We're not going to let that happen. So we're joined tonight by two terrific congressional candidates that have been just incredible in the job they've done. You see it. I mean, you've seen it all the way. The job they've done in their campaign. They beat people that were very good, very talented, great politicians, and they won. Dan, where is he? Dan Rodimer. Dan Rodimer. Dan Rodimer. And we're with you all the way, Dan. And Jim Marchant. Jim, thank you very much. Thank you, Jim. So we're backing you all the way. You got to get them in. We will take back the House. You know why? Because people cannot stand Nancy Pelosi. They don't like Nancy Pelosi. Even the woman that owns the beauty parlor turned her in. Can you believe that? Nancy Pelosi's a customer. She turned her in. She thought it was disgraceful, but that's what we're dealing with, a bunch of phonies. But you guys, we have your back 100%. Michael, you'll make sure, all right? I also want to introduce and thank … He's done a fantastic job. Nevada Republican Party Chairman, Michael McDonald. And a friend of mine, and thank you, Michael. Your former Attorney General Adam Laxalt. And a person with tremendous spirit and personality to put it mildly. She's tough, but she's very kind. She's a great person, Kimberly Guilfoyle. Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you. Thank you, Kimberly. The owner of the Chicago Cubs and he's in first place, so he's very happy, the RNC Finance Chairman, Todd Ricketts. Where is Todd? Todd, thank you. Great. Go win that pennant Todd. Win the pennant. One of the best people ever to work for me … One of the best people ever to work for me in government. He's tough, he's smart, he can be vicious, but he's just fair more than anything else. But he is a talented guy with tremendous energy and tremendous brain power, Rick Grenell. Thank you, Rick. Thank you Don. Thank you Don. Also, a Las Vegas legend, Rick Harrison. Rick, thank you Rick. You are a legend, aren't you, huh? Great job you've done. Great job you've done. A friend of mine for a long time. Years ago, he was looking for a place. Can I tell this story just quickly, do you mind? He was looking for a place and they said, ""Well, that sport's never going to make it. It's too violent."" They just don't know how violent the American people are, do they? They never quite figured that out. ""No."" They said, ""No, it'll never make it."" There's nobody like this guy, I'm telling you. I always say it's a great sport. Without him, I don't know what they'd do. I don't know if anything would make it… He could do anything. He is so smart, so tough, so cunning. He's been a friend of mine for a long time, I've been a friend of his, but I gave him a place a long time ago. And all I know is, just like we have outside, we had lines. I said, ""What the hell is going on here, Dana? This place is packed. We were packed. We had thousands of people that couldn't get in, and I was so nice. I said, ""Let's do it again, Dana, please."" And we did it again and again and again, and it became the UFC and he sold it and has a big chunk of it, but he got $4 billion when he sold it. $4 billion. That's not too bad. That's not too bad, Dana. But he really is, he's an incredible guy. And he also loves his fighters. He wants to take care of his fighters and he brought some of them along, the best. But I want to introduce Dana White. Dana, please stand up. And Dana brought along a few of his friends and these are not people you want to pick a fight with. Because under those beautiful suits, there are a lot of muscles, a lot of power, a lot of genius for fighting and for other things, but a lot of genius under those suits. A few members of the UFC community. Here's a man, he used to walk into that ring and he still does, and he's as good as there is in the world. Number one in the world. You don't want to pick a fight with him at a bar. Let's say you'd had a fight and you happen to meet Colby Covington. You say, ""What's your name?"" And he said, ""My name's Colby Covington."" And the first time I saw Colby Covington, he walks into the ring. Now he wasn't fighting, but he walked in with that same hat that you're wearing. It said, ""Keep America great."" It says, Make…"" He doesn't care. As long as it has Trump on in someplace, he doesn't care. He doesn't discriminate. But this was the same day that we had our conservative reporter beat to hell by that wise guy, who's now in big trouble for doing what he did. And then he walks in wearing the hat, ""Keep America great."" And he wears the hat and he's going like this because this was a big story. You remember what they did to that guy? Conservative reporter, not a fighter. He wasn't a fighter. And it was 10 people against one. Now, if we had 10 people against that one, those 10 people would be in serious trouble. They said, ""What the hell?"" But I'd like to introduce Colby Covington. Great fighter. Great, great fighter. Incredible. He is a great fighter. Three months ago, I saw him fight a guy. He looked like it would be impossible to beat. I never saw muscles. He had muscles on muscles on muscles. And Colby is a very fit guy and fantastic. But he didn't look quite the same. It wasn't even a contest. It went a few rounds. I couldn't believe what you did. He took him apart so easily. It was like an easy day at the office. So you have to explain that to me someday, Colby, but we love you, man. You're with us and where we are with you. Another great, great champion. Another great champion, Henry Cejudo, one of the best in the world. And Henry, please stand, please. Now, you won the championship twice, right Henry? Twice. He won it twice. Don't mess with him. Don't mess with him. And his brother, Alonzo, is here. Alonzo Cruz. Thank you very much, Alonzo. Thank you. Thank you. And Alonzo doesn't mess with Henry, he learned that a long time ago. So one of the best fighters in the world, and he's got a tremendous fight coming up against, I guess the number one rated pound for pound fighter, Justin Gaethje. Please stand up, Justin. Justin Gaethje, thank you. And you feel good about that fight? He said he's going to knock him out. Well, we're going to be watching. It's right before the election, but I think I'm going to be watching, okay? I'll be watching, you better believe it. That's going to be an incredible fight. Good luck. Good luck, Justin. Great fighter. And also Ali Abdelaziz, right? Abdelaziz. Great guy. One of the best. Thank you very much. But these are great people that they have so many people at the UFC and they've been big fans of us. They love our country. They love our country. And we loved them and nobody like our Dana. Thank you Dana, very much. Great honor. Thank you, man. Tonight, we're also praying for everyone throughout the West affected by the devastating wildfires. We want really forest management, we want forest management… My administration is closely coordinating with the state and local leaders, with the governor and we thank the more than 28,000 firefighters and first responders courageously braving the danger and their life, and I'm going there tomorrow. I'll be going to California tomorrow. We have meetings with FEMA and all of the different people. It'll be amazing to see. It's like the biggest we've ever had. It's crazy. It's crazy what's going on. Thousands and thousands and thousands of acres. It's crazy. So we're going to be there tomorrow. We'll be with the governor. We're also going to various other places. Washington also is in big trouble and Oregon. I spoke with the governor of Oregon and they've never had anything like it. And of course they also have a place called Portland and we will put that fire out. Just tell us to put it out, governor. That fire we'll put out. That's a much easier fire to put out. It would take us less than a half an hour. We've spent the last four years reversing the damage done by Joe Biden and all of the damage that him and his thought process has inflicted over a 47-year period. We passed record-setting tax cuts and record-setting regulation cuts. We achieved American energy independence. Nobody thought it was possible. When Biden pledged to abolish the production of American oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas, which is very clean, and he wanted to ban fracking, we said, ""No, we're not doing that. For 47 years, Biden crushed the dreams of American workers to enrich foreign countries. That's what happened. Look, he says he's going to change. He's been there for 47 years and you know that he's been there until three and a half years ago. So it's not like, ""Gee, he hasn't done it for 20."" He was there recently. They didn't do it. And you don't change. And you always go back to the first statement. His first statement was anti- religion. His first statement was anti-fracking, anti-energy. His first statement was anti all of the things, but it was really anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment. He even put this whack job, he even put Beto O'Rourke, Beto. Great deal for us. That's a great deal. By the way, our stock market is setting records, I hate to say, in the middle a pandemic. But hopefully, as we round that final turn on the pandemic, we're setting records with the stock market. Your 401k's are doing very well. Your stocks are doing very well. And you know what? If something would happen where he'd get in, and there's a headwind, believe it or not, that stock market would be much higher, but there's a headwind on the possibility, okay? Everything is a possibility. There's a headwind. But I'll tell you what, if he ever got in, you would have a market crash the likes of which this country has never seen before. Just remember it, just to remember it, because what they want to do is crazy, the Green New Deal, $100 trillion, the Green New Deal. That's more money than we could make in a thousand years, a hundred trillion dollars. ""We don't like that building. The windows are too big."" What do you do? ""Rip it down and build a new one."" ""All good. That sounds good."" I saved the U.S. auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And we're building many auto plants, you know that, some here, but we're building many auto plants in Michigan, many auto plants in Michigan. If we don't win Michigan after all those auto plants, and I don't know, but it's been tough but we won it last time. And we're showing a poll that just came out that we're two points up in Michigan. That's very good, that's very good. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rapid theft of American jobs. Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. That's what it is. For the last four years, I've been delivering for our incredible Hispanic community, I'm fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods, low taxes, low regulations on all Hispanic-owned small business, and they are great business people. And they understood that. They understood that, they understood it… And by the way, there's nobody that knows our Southern border better than, I call them the Hispanics, I call them the Latino. I said, ""What do you prefer?"" It's very interesting. Some say, ""Call us Latino."" Others say, ""Call us Hispanic."" Others say, ""Call us whatever the hell you want. We love you, we love you."" But our Hispanic population knows our Southern border better than anybody else. And they don't want criminals coming across. They want people to come across, but they want them to come across legally. And we have the strongest Southern border now that we've ever had. The Democrats and Biden would be a disaster for Hispanic Americans. He's pledged to wage attacks on Catholic organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor. They're fighting him. He supports taxpayer-funded extreme late-term abortion. Extreme late-term. He would allow left-wing anarchies to burn down your businesses. He would hand over your jobs to China, and your country to the socialists and beyond the socialists. The Democrat Party also continues to attack our incredible border agents, more than half of whom happen to be Hispanic Americans. And they're great. And I want to thank not only law enforcement, but a big part of law enforcement, the Border Patrol and the ICE agents, they're incredible. The ICE agents, Dana could sign some of them up, the ICE agents, they go into like a pack. They go at a pack. They go into a pack of MS-13 fighters. These are criminals and they do it like it's routine. You don't want that job. I don't see any of the people, male or female sitting in this audience, that wants that job, ICE. They take out thousands and thousands of MS-13 killers a year and bring them the hell back out of our country. All around our country, our communities are protected by Hispanic American heroes in law enforcement, and they deserve unwavering gratitude. I want to just thank you all, I want to thank you all. With us tonight are members of the National Border Patrol Council and they are great friends of us. I want to just thank them. The official union of our nation's incredible border patrol agents. And you know what? They're not supposed to do it, but they did it anyway, they endorsed me. I want to thank Brandon Judd, who's here, and Art Del Cueto. Art. Where's Brandon, where is my Brandon? Where is Brandon? Look at these guys. Look, they're ready. They're ready to fight. Hey Brandon, Art, pick out your toughest guy, I want to see whether or not he can take Colby in a fight. Don't do it. Thank you very much. Thanks fellas. We appreciate it very much. Thanks. Great job too. Great job. My administration has achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended catch and release. We stopped asylum fraud. We've deported 20,000 gang members and over half a million criminal aliens. We built over 320 miles, as of today, border wall and we're adding 10 new miles every single week. We're doing about 10 miles a week and we'll be finished with the wall very shortly. And you think, ""That was an easy one."" That was not an easy one. We were fought. Two things, and I say it, two things that never get old. Remember the Democrats are saying, ""A wall won't work."" ""Really? Tell me about it."" Wall works. That's one of the reasons our numbers are so good, but two things that will never get old- … one of the reasons our numbers are so good, but two things that will never get old, never, you know what they are? A wall and a wheel. A wall and a wheel. It'll never get old. A wall. I see so many things and I see all these businesses, computers, you come up with a new chip, you come up with a new computer, you come up with a new laptop. Three weeks later, you buy it, three weeks later, it's obsolete. But a wall will never be obsolete, and a wheel will never be obsolete. You come back in a thousand years, a wall and a wheel. Thanks to our powerful new security measures, we've doubled the amount of meth seized at the border over the last year, we've doubled. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in 75 years, the Space Force. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. And I've accomplished more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years. That's true. That's true. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. So good for Israel. So good that we did that. They paid $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash. I think Dana White could have made a slightly better deal than that. You know what we got for it? Nothing. We got nothing. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS. al-Baghdadi we eliminated the number one terrorist in the world. And we're talking over a 50 year period. Number one in the world, the mass murder of American troops and many other people throughout the world, Qasem Soleimani is dead. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we've achieved the two historic peace deals in the Middle East in just the last month, two, two. Over 75 years, they did two. We did two in a month. And many other countries are coming in, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have both agreed to normalize relations with Israel. Nobody thought this was possible. In fact, you didn't hear it because they don't report this. They just don't want to report it, but they nominated your President twice last week on two different subjects for a Nobel Prize. But the fake news media didn't cover it, so that's it. Biden got it. Remember… Well, okay. Remember when our great President, right? Barack Hussein Obama, he got it. Right? Like immediately. And they said, ""Why did you get it?"" And he was unable to explain, do you remember? ""Why did you get it?"" Because it was like, he just became President, and they said, ""We're going to nominate Barack Hussein Obama for the Nobel Peace award, right? And what happened? And then Biden said, ""What about me?"" They said, ""Who the hell is he? This guy, what the hell has he done?"" But it's true. Obama got it for no reason whatsoever. Rick, you know that? No reason whatsoever. Joe Biden brought you only endless wars, I'm bringing you peace and I'm bringing our troops back home. They're all coming back. Endless wars. Biden voted for the Iraq war. He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. When I banned China from coming in, highly infected, he said it was hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died just by that one move alone. When the- Thank you. I agree, actually, but I don't think I'm allowed to say it. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II, we're delivering life-saving therapies, we've achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country, anywhere in the world. You don't hear this. Europe's excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the US, and despite their very punitive lockdowns, they're once again, seeing very large spikes in cases, unfortunately. The United States has experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation and the fastest recovery by far. Who's going to do well? And there's a reason for it. Through our historic relief programs, we've saved more than half a million Nevada jobs and over 42,000 Nevada businesses, we've saved 42,000 of your businesses. And he's looking at doing all of this stuff. He will destroy protections for preexisting conditions and decimate your 401s, your retirement system, your stocks, he'll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal illegal aliens. He wants to cut your vet facilities in half, go to socialized healthcare and end 180 million Americans' private healthcare plans, which they love. Biden pledges to oppose school choice, and he stated that if elected, charter schools are gone. And charter schools have been great. In a second term, I'll provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a limitless future for all Americans. It's really a vote for the American dream. That's what it is. It's the American dream versus the American nightmare. Instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we've been through, we are changing Washington. So in concluding, this wonderful afternoon, and again, Don, thank you very much, but in concluding, this wonderful afternoon, and if the governor comes after you, which he shouldn't be doing, I'll be with you all the way. I'll be with you all the way. Don't worry about a thing. Over the next four years, we'll be making America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we'll end our reliance on China once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring economies, and record prosperity. We will expand Opportunity Zones, and we will continue cutting taxes and regulations at a level that nobody has ever seen before. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities. And we'll be watching the ballots very closely also, by the way. And we will ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not in enforcing their own agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of these endless ridiculous foreign wars, all coming back. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength, two and a half trillion dollars, have the strongest military we've ever had, beautiful brand new equipment. When I took it over, it was totally depleted, our military. We have the greatest equipment that any military has ever even conceived of, things that people have no idea what we have, and let's keep it that way. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency already signed, further reduce health insurance premiums, and the cost of prescription drugs will be dropping like a rock very soon. The drug companies do not like me too much. It's a favored nations clause I signed. We will strongly protect Medicare, and your Social Security will be totally secure. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. When I took over, NASA was a shell of itself. It was closed, they had grass growing in the runways, grass growing in the runways. Now it's the number one space center in the world by far. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust, and we're going to keep it that way. For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for your state, Nevada. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and on November 3rd or sooner, get out and vote. From Carson City to Elko, from Las Vegas to Reno, from Minden to right here in Henderson, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our great freedom. Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, innovators and trailblazers who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis and inspired the world with the brilliant lights of the Vegas Strip. Our American ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are going to make it greater than ever before. That's what we're doing. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are, you know the story, going to keep on working, going to keep on fighting, and going to, like these guys, keep on winning, winning, winning. You hear that, Colby? You hear that, Justin? Okay? He's fighting a tough customer, but I don't know. I think maybe, I'm in Vegas, I'll have to place… Is the President allowed to place a bet? I don't know. They'll say, ""The President of the United States just placed two bets, Justin and Colby."" I don't know. I don't know, but they are great. That'd be easy money. Well, maybe not that easy. I don't know if it's that easy. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Nevada, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you."
Trump," Well, thank you to Vice President Pence. Thank you, Mike. And hello Pennsylvania. Hello. It's great to be back in this state that gave us the Liberty Bell, Pennsylvania Steel, Hershey chocolate. I like Hershey chocolate. The Nittany Lions. The Nittany Lions, they're doing pretty well too and the incredible American Patriots just like you, you are Patriots. Thank you very much. Thank you. Under Republican leadership, America is stronger than ever before and we are respected again. Last month you saw it, we smashed expectations with another 266,000 jobs and unemployment is now more than a 50-year low. We have never seen what's going on with different groups. Unemployment is at a position we've never had anything like this. You are so lucky I became your president. I'm only kidding. I have to say I'm kidding because the fake news back there will take that. They'll take that statement and they'll blow it up and they'll say, ""He said they were lucky to have him as president. What a horrible thing to say."" Because they're fake. Anyway, here in Pennsylvania you had the single best year that you've ever had in the history of our country, not bad. The Pennsylvania unemployment rate has reached an all time record low. And I hate to tell you this, when I was campaigning three and a half years ago, I'd come here, you weren't doing so well, folks. You weren't doing so well. Wages were way down, unemployment was way up. It wasn't a pretty picture. Just a few months ago, I visited the new Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County at $6 billion with a B, $6 billion. It is the largest investment in Pennsylvania history. We're ending decades of failed trade policies that devastated communities all across the state. For generations, American manufacturing was the bedrock of your economy, the bedrock. Remember the last administration, "" You need a magic wand. It'll never come back."" We found the magic wand, didn't we? Then came NAFTA, the NAFTA disaster, I call it, one of the worst trade deals in the history of any country and the loss of one in three Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs. Your politicians always pledged to fix it. They'd talk about it for years and years and decades, but they never were able to do it. They came and they went to Washington and they did nothing. But unlike those politicians, I keep my promises. And I love Pennsylvania. I went to school in Pennsylvania, you know that right? I know it well. And I'm thrilled to report that we are on the verge of ending the NAFTA catastrophe once and for all. Congress will soon vote on my new trade deal, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement or USMCA. After years of waiting, many, many years, many, many decades, they've been looking for this, and then we got it done and we've been waiting for a long time for Nancy Pelosi to announce USMCA and she did it on the same day that they announced that they are going to impeach the 45th president of the United States and your favorite president, I think. And the reason they announced it on the same day, one hour later, they announce impeachment, a few guys standing behind her. They announced the impeachment, and then an hour later, she announced that she's going to USMCA. You know why? It's a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they are embarrassed by the impeachment, and our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment. And think of it this way also, the silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt, that's the reason they approved USMCA. So that's okay with me, because they approved it and they're very happy to have it. But honestly, it's an incredible deal for our country. Took too long, it waited in Congress for too long a time. Incredible deal, and replacing the worst, NAFTA. We've also just reached a deal with Congress to invest a record $738 billion more into our great military. When I took over, I will tell you, I became president… Think of it, almost three years ago. By the way, was that the most exciting night ever? I'm just watching these people, that was one of the greatest evenings in the history of television from a rating standpoint, from an excitement standpoint, what the hell would they do without me and you? They'd be gone. About a month before I ran, I picked up a New York Times, it was like a leaflet that you had out at a grocery store and now it's thick. They've got all their reporters covering Trump, Trump, Trump. I can't imagine they won't endorse because without me winning, you know what happens? They all go down the tombs they got, all of them, Washington Post, New York Times, those very dishonest networks. They are very dishonest, very, very dishones. No, they're very dishonest people. And I have to say this, look, and I always have to say this, you have some really great journalists and you have some honest publications, but not too many of them, I have to be honest with you. Well, you know that. Does anybody think the media is honest? Does anybody think they're totally corrupted and dishonest? All right. The legislation will also officially establish something that's so important to me because it's where it's at. And a lot of people used to smile and now outside of the wall, which we're building… The wall is going on. It gets one of the biggest applause of anything, it's the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force. We're opening up the Space Force because you know what, that's where it's at. And everything's built right here in the United States. That's simple. And by the way, we build the greatest weapons, the greatest planes, the greatest ships, we build it in the United States, there's nobody that comes close. We have the greatest military equipment anywhere in the world, rockets and missiles, no place builds it like us. We have the best in the world and we sell it to allies and they all want to buy from the United States. We've never had a thing like this. We are so hot. We are so hot. And just a few weeks ago, the United States Special Forces brought the world's number one terrorist to justice. Thanks to the strength and courage of our warriors, and they're great warriors, the bloodthirsty savage known as Al Baghdadi is now dead. And he was quickly replaced by his second-in-command and his second-in-command is now dead. And we've got our eye on and our sights on third also, we know exactly where and when, but it's becoming a very unpopular job, not a lot of takers and that's what we want. Go back to living a good normal life because America is winning again. America is winning again like never before. And as I always say, and I've already said it twice tonight, this country is so respected and we were not respected four years ago, we were laughed at. But while we're delivering historic victories for the American people, the radical left Democrats and the failed Washington establishment are trying to erase your votes, nullify the election and overthrow our democracy. Not going to happen, don't worry about it. I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it. And I have to say this about the Republicans, the Republicans… And you have a lot of great ones here tonight, your Congressman. You have a lot of great ones, these congressmen are great. The Republicans have never been so United as they are right now, ever. The House, the Senate, we've never been this United because it's all a hoax and they understand it. They also understand poll numbers, but I'm sure that had nothing to do with it. But the impeachment hoax is about overturning your great 2016 vote, or in the alternative, trying to win the 2020 election. That's not going to happen. Yesterday, the Justice Department's Inspector General released a report detailing the outrageous, scandalous and unprecedented abuses of power. Get them out. Get her out. Get her out. Get her out. See, these guys want to be so politically correct, you get her out. You see that? I'll tell you, law enforcement is so great. That particular guy wanted to be so politically correct. We don't want to be politically correct. I don't know who he was, he didn't do the greatest job, so they tried to frame innocent people in the ludicrous… It all started with the Russia witch hunt. Then the inspector general shocking report proved that the Obama FBI obtained secret warrants to spy on my campaign based on a phony foreign dossier of debunk smears, paid for by crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. The FBI failed to disclose the nature of the political hit job to the Pfizer court. They hid it, they deceived it, and they lied. The dossier was written by a discredited foreign agent who quote, ""Desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being the United States president."" What's this? Folks, they spied on our campaign, they spied. Never happened before in the history of our country and we're really wise to it. We're wise to it. The inspector general found that the FBI spying application contained 17 errors and omissions, commonly known as lies and deceit. When the FBI… And you have great people in the FBI, but not in leadership. You have not good people in leadership, you haven't had. When the FBI uncovered evidence showing that we did absolutely nothing wrong, which was right at the beginning, they hid that exonerating, you know that? They hid it. They hid it so nobody could see it, so they could keep this hoax going on for two years. They knew right at the beginning that it was all a frame up, a set up, but they hid it so that nobody could see it, so they could keep it going on, thinking they were going to hurt us politically. But now we're stronger politically than we were ever before. And the FBI also sent multiple undercover human spies to surveil and record people associated with our campaign. Look how they've hurt people. They've destroyed the lives of people that were great people, that are still great people. Their lives have been destroyed by scum, by scum. An FBI lawyer forged, took an email… forged, forged an email used as evidence, an act which is now the subject of a criminal referral. What they did is so unbelievable. Oh, I look forward… I don't know. I don't know, keep away. I look forward to Bull Durham's report, that's the one I look forward to. And this report was great by the IG, especially since he was appointed by President Barack Hussein Obama. Considering that fact, it was great because we learned a lot of things that nobody would have found out variously, although I suspect we would have. We also know from a previous inspector general investigation that many of these same high ranking officials were consumed with anti- Trump and anti-Trump people hatred and bias, texting about an insurance policy, let's have an insurance… remember? Remember? Peter Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page. Remember? ""Lisa, I love you so much. Lisa, please, Lisa please. Lisa, I've never loved anyone like you. We won't allow this to happen to our country. Lisa, please tell me you love me. Lisa, I love you."" ""Peter, I love you. I love you like I've never loved anyone. And if for any reason she loses, even though she's a stone called corrupt person, if for any reason she loses, Peter, we've got to have an insurance policy, we have to do it because we're going to go… "" And that's what's been happening for the last two and a half years. It was their phony insurance policy. So FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, so in love that she didn't know what the hell was happening texted the head of Counter Intelligence, Peter Strzok, likewise so in love he couldn't see straight. This poor guy, did I hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing to keep him away from Lisa? That's what I heard. I don't know if it's true. The fake news will never report it, but it could be true. No, that's what I heard. I don't know. I mean who could believe a thing like that? No, I heard that Peter Strzok needed a restraining order to keep him away from his once lover. Ah, Lisa, I hope you're miss him. Lisa, he'll never be the same. But he said he's not ever going to become president and Strzok look back, ""No, no, he won't. We'll stop it. We'll stop it."" Can you believe we found these texts? This is FBI agents at a high level. ""No, no. We'll stop it."" They're going to stop us from winning an election and then we have to listen, ""There was no bias. Oh, there was no bias."" Think of these people, they write here was no bias. And yet he saying, ""No, no, darling, we'll stop it."" And then they announce there was no bias. Now you know what we're doing, and it's not easy, and somebody said a regular president… I don't want to use the word normal because that's not a nice normal refer… A regular president would have been under a table, thumb in the mouth saying, ""Take me home mommy, this is too tough for me."" It's true. True, they know. And while it was tough on my family, I have to say, very unfair to my family, very tough on my family. I have a great family, tough… For me, it's my life. I do it, I do it. It's one thing, but very tough on a family thing, a thing like this happens, it's a disgrace. But day after day we're exposing something called that filthy, disgusting, horrible swamp and we're cleaning it up. And now after and a half years now that the Russia witch hunt is dead, a big fat disgusting fraud, the Congressional Democrats are pushing the impeachment witch hunt having to do with Ukraine, but that's already failing. You saw their so-called articles of impeachment today, people are saying they're not even a crime. What happened? All of these horrible things, remember? Bribery and this and that. Where are they? They send these two things and not even a crime. This is the lightest, weakest impeachment…. Our country has had actually many impeachments, you recall judges and lots of… many impeachments, but it was on today, everybody said, ""This is impeachment light."" This is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country by far. It's not even like an impeachment. These people are stone cold crooked. When a guy like shifty Schiff, he's a corrupt politician, he made up my statement because… See, I did one thing very good, as soon as I heard about this deal, I released my statement immediately, but he had already made horrible statements. And by the way, the whistleblower, the whistleblower defrauded our country because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue and we broke up the game. Remember the second whistleblower was coming, right? And then the informer, who is the informer? I know who the informer is. So the informer obviously gave him a false information because they wrote in the whistleblower report, they wrote something totally different from what I said, what I said was perfect. But it screwed up the whole works because most guys would never do that. They didn't even know probably that we had it transcribed, professionally transcribed, word for word transcribed, so beautiful. Am I lucky I had it transcribed? Think of that. Think of that. So when I said release it… And I don't like doing that because you're releasing it, it's a conversation with a foreign leader, in this case, a very fine gentlemen, president of Ukraine, the new president of Ukraine. And we call them up and we said, ""Would it be okay?"" Our secretary of state made the call, ""Would it be okay?"" And they didn't know what we were talking about, but they said, ""Yeah, it's okay."" And by the way, he, his foreign minister, everybody did you know they said, ""There was no pressure. He didn't do anything wrong. There was no pressure put on us."" That didn't stop anybody but we released the conversation and that gummed it up. Now, all of a sudden we never heard from the second whistleblower. We never heard about who the informer was. The whistleblower who's going to come out strong, he's disappeared. Where's the whistleblower? He's disappeared. He's gone. Maybe our great Congressman can find him. He's gone. Maybe our great Congressmen can find him. Okay? But the whistleblower is gone. He flew the coop because he reported incorrectly, and the IG, who didn't want to look at the conversation, he was so anxious to turn the whistleblower report over to Congress so that Congress could have fun with it, ought to be ashamed of himself. But today, the House Democrats announced these two flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous articles of impeachment. The House Democrats are walking back from everything they claimed. With today's announcement, they're now admitting there was no collusion, there was no obstruction of justice, and there were no crimes whatsoever. There are no crimes. It says that, there are no crimes. They're impeaching me and there are no crimes. This has to be a first in history. They're impeaching me. You know why? Because they want to win an election. And that's the only way they can do it. So the Democrats have nothing, and they've turned the somber process of impeachment. And it was, you know, to me, impeachment is a very ugly word. It's a word I associate with some very bad times in our country. The good news is we're having the best times in history in our country. Okay? But the word impeachment, to me, is a very, very ugly word. It's a dark, ugly word. But, but I have to tell you, as bad as it is, it meant something. When you had serious high crimes and misdemeanors, when you had serious, go ahead, it's impeachment. That would happen every 50 years, every 40 years, every 100 years. This was a big deal. They're making it so like, ""Let's do it every six months."" They've cheapened a process. They've cheapened a process. These people are so bad, the radical left Democrats, and I actually think that Pelosi, who by the way, by the way, by the way, she has totally lost control. She has totally … It's being run now by this crazy AOC plus three. AOC plus three. Now it's being run by other people. The far left has just grabbed that party. It is so sad to see. And she knew what would happen. I didn't, because I didn't figure the polls would go through the roof. They went out today. In Michigan, in Wisconsin, in a place called Pennsylvania. No, no. The polls are through the roof. They're called swing states, very important states. We won Pennsylvania the last time, and we're going to win it again, but even bigger. Our polls have gone, over the last month, they've gone through the roof. You look at it, take a look at it, it came out today. The FireHouse poll, it's an important poll. It was always good. I never looked at it. Today, I like it a lot. We're up through … nobody can even believe it. So what Pelosi did, and as I said, they do the impeachment, then right away, let's do USMCA, right on top of it. You'd think she'd wait like a day. She wanted to smother the impeachment crap, and that's probably what she did, at least to an extent. But any Democrat that votes for this sham will be voting to sacrifice their house majority, their dignity, and their career. Okay? And some of these partisan lunatics have already said that if they fail this time, think of this. How about Low IQ Maxine Waters? How about Green? How about Green? We've Green. How about Green, where he said, ""We have to impeach him because if we don't impeach him we're not going to win the election."" This is what we're dealing with. You know, we're dealing with some very bad people. We're dealing with people that don't respect you. And by the way, you know they talk about the elite? You're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. You're the elite. You got better education. You got better everything. You're the elite. It always bothers me, they said, ""The elite."" This is the elite. Look at these people. How beautiful. This is the elite. You know who are the elite? You look at those jobs reports. We're the best in history unemployment for African Americans, best in history unemployment Hispanic Americans, best in history unemployment Asian Americans. You're the elite. You're the elite. But they said they'll do it again because this has been a total bust. They'll do it again. And by the way, the Senate's been so professional, so good, so strong, so solid. Just like these gentlemen in the House. So solid. So we have to vote these crazy people the hell out of office. And in 2020 I'm going to work like hell that we take over the House. We have to take over the House. We have to. Right? Got to take over the House, Mike. So here are the facts that Shifty Schiff … Is that guy the worst? He comes up to a microphone, now he comes up to a microphone like two and a half years ago, ""I have absolute proof that the President of the United States conspired with Russia."" Russia? What the hell do I have to do with Russia? By the way, Russia wishes that Hillary Clinton won. They wish. We are now number one in the world in energy. Russia is number three. We're beating out Russia and Saudi Arabia. You'd have windmills all over the place if you had Crooked Hillary. They'd be knocking out those birds left and right. Those windmills. Wah, wah, wah. ""Darling, I want to watch television tonight and there's no damn wind. What do I do? I want to watch the election results. Darling, there's no wind. The damn wind just isn't blowing like it used to because of global warming, I think. I think it's global warming. Global warming. No more wind, no more life. The ocean is going to rise 1/8 of an inch within the next 250 years. We're going to be wiped out!"" Look, I want clean air. I want clean water, crystal clean, I want, and that's what we have at a record level. Our air and our water are cleaner now than it's ever been with all that we're doing, and we haven't closed up all of our industry, and we haven't closed up our businesses and lost all those jobs. And right now, we're by far the largest economy in the world. If you remember, you could look, if you go back five, six, seven years, in 2019 they say China was going to catch us as the world's largest economy. Guess what? They're way behind. They're way behind. Because over the last three years, you see the stock market set 131 records from the day. Think of that. And that means jobs, that means 401ks. I have so many people that come up to me, ""Thank you, sir. My wife is so in love with me because I went up 79% in the 401k. She thinks I'm a genius. She always thought I was a total stiff, a dumb, stupid dope. Now she thinks I'm a financial genius, sir. And all I did was buy some stock. I have stock in a 401k, and you made me into a genius, sir. She loves me so much more than she ever did."" Shows you the power of money, right? Isn't that terrible? But I have so many people, 401ks are through the roof, your jobs are through the roof, we have the lowest unemployment rate. And now, more importantly than anything, wages are up for the first time in many, many years, decades, decades. You remember four years ago I was here, and I told people, I said, ""You know, 20 years ago, people made more money than they made four years ago."" Not now. Not anymore. Because people now can not only make a lot more money, if they don't like their job, they go out and they get a different job, and they get more money, and ultimately they find one that they love. You have so many opportunities right now. Wages are up, jobs are up. And today we set a new record, almost 160 million people are working. We've never come close to that number. That's a hell of a number. But just quickly, here are the facts on Shifty Schiff. Dishonest guy, makes up my statements. He said, ""The President of Ukraine repeatedly declared that there was no pressure,"" but he didn't want to say that. We said, ""Say it. Say it, you crooked bastard, say it. But he doesn't want to say it. We said, ""Sat it!"" I'd like to force him to say it. He'll walk up to the mic, ""Ladies and gentlemen,"" guy's a total corrupt guy. Listen, just to finish off, a man who I really, I don't know him, but I respect him because the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, and he said it so strongly, ""I have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance."" He just said that the Democrats, who are corrupt, refuse to say that, and that's ultimately the only one that matters, the leaders of Ukraine, because they're the ones that know of this pressure, not some crooked ambassador that's a deep stater, or that's a Bushy, or that's a Clintonite, or that's a Barack Obama ambassador. Okay? The ones that matter are the leadership of the country that we're talking about. They refuse to say it because they're dishonest people. There's only one way to stop the rabid partisan Democrats, Pennsylvania voters must show up in 2020 so we can take back the House, hold the Senate, and keep the White House. It's the only way. Only way. Okay, so I'm going to ask these people to come up on this stage because we have warriors with us tonight. We love warriors, like the guys that killed al-Baghdadi. You know how much press I got? I don't care about press. But Conan the dog got more than I did, and that's okay. Conan was almost electrocuted, he deserves it. They gave me about a day, and that's okay, because the people understand, we made a great decision. And remember this, al-Baghdadi was the founder of ISIS, al-Baghdadi was a vicious, ruthless person, al-Baghdadi created a caliphate bigger than the State of Ohio. Think of that, that's a big caliphate. And we now have taken 100% of the caliphate, and we have thousands and thousands of ISIS prisoners. With Obama, you did nothing. You did nothing but get your ass kicked. True. True. All right, we're joined tonight by many of the terrific warriors that have helped me so much in so many ways. They fight for us. They really are incredible. And they come right from the State of Pennsylvania. Hey, do you ever notice where Biden keeps saying he's in the wrong state? Like if he's in Ohio, ""It's great to be an Iowa tonight."" If he's in Pennsylvania, ""It's wonderful to be in the State of Delaware."" What is wrong with this guy? What's wrong with him? There's something wrong. Okay? There's something wrong. No, he keeps … How many times can you do that? So far, it could happen, because you know I was doing six and seven a day that last month, that last beautiful month that I loved, I was doing six. I left these guys alone. I didn't want to do interviews, they were a waste of time. We just did these big beautiful rallies. And you know, if you start getting a little … you know, I went to Michigan, then I went to Wisconsin, then I went … I'm sitting here saying, ""What the hell is going on? These crowds are incredible."" And we had the biggest crowds. By the way, to this day, there has never been, and they'll always correct me, in the history of politics, in the history of our country, there has never been anybody that drew crowds like we draw, and I don't have a guitar. I have no guitar. But this has never happened. I mean if you took Ronald Reagan, and we all like Ronald Reagan, I liked him, I thought he was a great guy, but if he came to Pennsylvania for a rally, if he had 1,000 people in a ballroom or something, you know? I mean we're getting crowds, 25-30,000 people, and then there'll be 20,000 people outside. We set up screens outside, and if anybody would like to stand in the rain watching. And do you people out there, I'm sorry, it's pretty rough. But no, there's never been anything like it. One instruction get me the biggest arena you can get. We don't have empty seats. I mean look at this. How many seats is this? 11,000? How much? 10,500, it's packed. It's beyond that. And don't forget, look at the floor, and then you go out. No, and then you go out and you look outside, and you have thousands and thousands because there's a spirit for what we're doing. We're fixing our country, we're healing our country. We're making America great again. So I want to ask a couple of our great warriors to come forward. Representative Glenn Thompson, come up here, Glenn. Come up here. A man that's been a friend of mine for a long time, Mike Kelly. Don't get in the fight with Mike. Come up, Mike. A wonderful man who represents this area, Scott Perry. Representative Lloyd Smucker. Lloyd. A guy who was always there for us, John Joyce. And two people that you all know very well in this state, they bring home the bacon, Dan Meuser and Fred Keller. Thank you fellas. Thank you. I want to also bring back our Pennsylvania Party Chairman. And I know his grandfather, I shouldn't say that to you. He was a tremendous man, Dan Tabas, but I'm going to introduce somebody that Dan always said had tremendous talent. Little did I know that he'd be working with us, and he's really working well. He's smart, he's tough. Lawrence Tabas. Come on up, Lawrence. Come on up. Also with us tonight, Pennsylvania Trump Victory Chairwoman, Bernie. You know this, right? You know this person. Comfort. Do you know who that is? Do you know who that is? Everybody knows who that is. National Committeeman Bob Asher, RNC Co-chairman Tommy Hicks has been incredible, and my friend David Urban. David. So I just want to thank, this is an amazing group of people, and with their help, and the help of everyone here, we are going to set records like we've never set before. You know, I used to say, and I sort of still have to say, 2016, I don't know if anything like that can ever happen, but I think we're much better. All of the things I said, ""We're going to cut taxes. We're going to cut regulations. We're going to take care of our vets,"" look what we did for our vets, with choice, right? Look what we did. Look what we did. We now have the ability to fire all of the bad people that are in the VA. Right? Fired over 8,000 people that were disrespecting our vets. They wouldn't have done it in primetime, I can tell you that. But what we've done for our vets, what we've done in rebuilding our military, what we've done in so many ways, and we, unlike the Democrats, will protect your Second Amendment. Okay? So we've done a job, and we're proud of it, and we have tremendous people. Let's give them a hand, and thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, folks. Vote for these people. Even if you don't like them, vote for them. Oh, that's a beautiful new hat. Look at the hat that guy's got on. How's that hat working out? Is that good? I love that hat. Look at this guy, that says Keep America Great. Should we do the poll? Should we do a poll? Okay, ready? So we have the greatest phrase in the history of politics, Make America Great Again. Wait. And we have our new phrase, because we've made America great. I've told you, stock market, we've rebuilt our military, we've cut your taxes at a level that nobody could even think possible. Take a look at your median income, take a look at what's happened. The numbers, median household income, take a look at your numbers. With President Bush, it went up $400 in eight years. With President Obama, it went up $975 in eight years. With President Trump, it went up 5,000, but whoa, whoa, whoa, in less than three years. That's a big thing. Wait. And then when you add energy savings, and you add tax savings, you have almost a $10,000 gain in three years. That's a big difference. And that's one of the very big reasons why our, I think that and regulations, but that's one of the very big reasons why our economy is doing so well, because they talk about our consumer is loaded with money. Thank you very much, Mr. President, I appreciate it. But with the help of everyone here, we have now the hottest economy. You know when I meet dictators, and presidents, and kings, and queens, and prime ministers, they all come into that beautiful Oval Office. So beautiful, right? So respected. And the first thing they almost always say, ""Sir, congratulations on your economy. We're trying to do the same thing."" I said, ""You won't be able to do it. You won't."" They won't be able to. Let them give it a shot. But they all say, ""Congratulations on the great job you've done with economy."" But we've all done the great job. Not me. We've all done it. I've been your spokesman, and I've done a good job as spokesman. But they all say that. But we've done a good job in many ways. You know, all of the promises that I made, I'm the only politician in history that I've actually kept more promises than I made. Think of that. In other words, I made here, like a thing like Right to Try, nobody talked about Right to Try. We got Right to Try. That's somebody terminally ill, we have the greatest medicines in the world, the greatest doctors, the greatest labs in the world, nobody close, but it takes years to get it approved. And I got it approved so you can sign a document, get it. If you want to see the lives that we're saving, it's a beautiful thing. A beautiful thing is happening, Right to Try. Right to Try. But we've also created 7 million new jobs since the election. If I would have said that, the fake news would have gone crazy, they would have said that's impossible. These people would have gone crazy. They go crazy anyway, and I don't even say it. And right here in Pennsylvania, we've created 160, 000 brand new beautiful jobs, and you have companies moving in and moving back. And as I said, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment, the lowest ever in the history of our country, the lowest unemployment rates. Wages for low income workers have gone up more than 10%. Nobody thought that was possible. They're one of the biggest, in terms of a group, one of the biggest beneficiaries. This year, 40 million American families will benefit from the Republican Child Tax Credit, each receiving an average of $2,200. We ended the last administration's war on American energy, the United States is now, and I said it, and I'll say it all night long, number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, and there's nobody even close. In the State of Pennsylvania, natural gas production is up 34% since our election, 34. Virtually every leading Democrat has pledged to entirely eliminate American production of oil, clean coal, natural gas. I don't think somebody coming into Pennsylvania, you know those new petrochemical plants, they don't like them at all. Thousands and thousands of jobs. Incredible. Millions of dollars in taxes. How about going to the State of Texas? We had one candidate who turned out not to be too good a candidate, right? Beto, Beto. Remember? So he wanted to get rid of religion, the Bible, he wanted to get rid of guns, and he wanted to get rid of oil. How about going to Texas and say, ""No Bible, no oil,"" think of this one, ""No Bible, no oil, no guns."" I think you could be Abraham Lincoln and not win that particular race. And it wouldn't be much different in the State of Pennsylvania, that I can tell you. But you know, somebody that believes in that is Sleepy Joe Biden. He was caught telling a far left radical activist that he would shut down fossil fuel production in Pennsylvania. You saw that. But the voters of this Commonwealth will never, ever let that happen. Can you imagine a guy coming in, whether it's him or anybody else? They all want to do it. He just raises his hand, he has no clue what he's doing. They raise their hand. Remember he looked? Do you want to give illegal aliens healthcare, even though we're taking it away from our own soldiers that are up … and he looks and they're all raising their hand? Did you see that? Well, he, ""Oh, oh, oh, okay, I'll do it too."" In addition to replacing NAFTA, I've taken the toughest ever action against China's trade abuses. They want to make a deal so badly. And we're doing well with the deal, but they want to make a deal. ""Please make a deal. We don't want to pay tariffs anymore. Please, please."" Thanks to our steel tariffs, steel mills in Pennsylvania are roaring back to life. And U.S. Steel has just announced $1 billion investment in Mon Valley Works in Pittsburgh. You know that, right? $1 billion. They weren't investing, they were divesting. The steel companies, it's an amazing achievement. We tax all of the dumped steel, comes in from China and other places, 25%. … the dump steel comes in from China and other places. 25%. All of it. All of a sudden our steel mills are doing again. We need steel. It's not like you could say, ""Gee, we'll get it from another country."" We need that for defense. We need it for our ships, we need it for our planes. We need it. We can't play games with steel. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. Very importantly, in everything we do, we are putting America first. Sorry. We gave up on the globalist folks. Let's build the world. Let's forget about our country. Let's just rebuild the world. Or no issue have the Democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the American people than on the issue of immigration. Far left politician… I mean, they're fighting me on the wall, you have no idea. But we're building it and it's fine and we have the money coming in from the military. I've got it from here, from there, from there. Believe me, if I weren't a good developer, you could forget about that wall. I've got here, there, there. These people fought me and we've started winning in court. You know what? Speaking of court, we will soon have 182 federal judges, including Court of Appeals. Nobody can believe it. All because Barack Obama gave us 142 empty seats. When you're a president, they always say, ""I disagree. I think the most important thing we can do is defense,"" right? But beyond defense, they always say the most important thing you can do is judges and justices of the Supreme Court. We have two great ones. Great ones. But they always say, ""Judges and Supreme Court justices."" When you leave office, I hope in 5 years, 9 years, 13 years, 17 years, 21 years, 25 years, 29 years. When I leave office… Now I'm only doing that to drive them totally crazy. That drives them crazy. Even joking about it. We have this idiot comedian who stands up, he's talking to a guest, right? He said, ""You know he's going to win, don't you? You know it."" The guy goes, ""No, no. We're going to fight. We're going to fight."" And they will. ""No, no, no. You know he's going to win."" Then he goes, ""You know he's going to win. And you know he's never leaving, don't you? He's never leaving."" At first I thought he was kidding. He's a whack job. He is totally serious. He honestly believes that. I don't know, should we give it a shot? Maybe we'll give it a shot. I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding. Media, I'm only kidding. They won't write that, but that's okay. They won't write the, ""I'm only kidding part."" But far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities demonstrating their sneering contempt, scorned and disdained for everyday Americans. These jurisdictions deliberately release dangerous, violent, criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets, where they are free to offend, where they are free to kill, where they are free to rape, where they are free to beat up people except for ICE because ICE is much tougher than them. They don't beat up ICE. They don't beat up ICE. You're lucky we have ICE. They want to put ICE out of business. That's not happening. ICE is… They're incredible people. They're great patriots and they're tough. Thanks to Democrat immigration policies, innocent Americans in all 50 states are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals. Last summer, at least 19 illegal aliens were charged in connection with grizzly homicides, including hacking victims to death and ripping out, in two cases, their hearts. Weeks ago, two illegal aliens and members of the savage gang, MS-13, who we are removing from our country by the thousands, were charged with relentlessly beating a wonderful, beautiful high school teenager to death with a baseball bat and chopping the body apart with a machete. One of the animals accused was previously released by local authorities in defiance of an ICE demand. ICE warned and said, ""You can't let them go."" They wanted them. They would do anything for them. They wanted them to hand this animal over for deportation back to his country. Get them the hell out of our country, right? Democrats' sanctuary cities also give safe haven to those who commit violent sex crimes. Since Montgomery County, Maryland declared itself a sanctuary jurisdiction in July, we have already identified nine illegal aliens who have been arrested for rape, sexual assault, including a 26-year-old man charged with raping and viciously strangling a young, wonderful woman who was entering her apartment, innocently entering her apartment. She was raped and killed, strangled to death. Sanctuary city. Maryland. But these are only the cases we know about. Sanctuary cities and jails actively conceal illegal alien crime and criminals from federal government. Federal government wants to take them out, or in some cases, if it's real violence, and we don't want to pay for the cost, but we do, put them into very strong jails. The sanctuary city of Philadelphia. The sanctuary city in Philadelphia is one of the very worst sanctuaries anywhere in America. Did you know that? I mean, I know Philadelphia well. Going to school here, we never heard about sanctuary cities, did we? Weeks ago an illegal alien charged with rape, sexual assault of a child, and inflicting serious bodily injury was released by Philadelphia to wander free in your communities. By the way, you may have the worst district attorney or whatever the hell you call it. This guy, I've been hearing about this guy, he lets killers out almost immediately. What the hell? How did you let that happen? Instead of handing them over while still in jail, they defied ICE. They fought with ICE and set him loose upon an unsuspecting family. Thankfully, at great time and effort, our brave ICE officers were eventually able to track him down, arrest him, detain him, and do what has to be done. How do you elect Democrats when they create a sanctuary city of Philadelphia? I don't get it. Four MS-13 gang members were also arrested in Pennsylvania in connection with the brutal and sadistic murders of a 21-year-old and a 15-year-old. As we speak, a criminal illegal alien with three prior deportations is roaming free in Pennsylvania because he was released by the city of Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. You better get yourself a new prosecutor in this place, I want to tell you. That's a horrible thing. No, it's a national story, how he wants everybody to not pay the price. You're talking about not paying the price for rape, for murder, for other horrible crimes. How stupid can you be? The charges against this alien include rape, aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, indecent exposure, and terroristic threats. Other than that, he was a very nice person. Philadelphia has defied ICE and released illegals charged with everything from assault, to kidnapping, to drug crimes, to sex crimes, to homicide murder. Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos. Republicans stand for law and order, and we stand for justice. We stand for justice. We side with law enforcement and with law-abiding Americans, not ruthless gang members and not violent criminals, aliens that come into our country illegally. They take our payments. Payments. Some of these people with these crazy laws that you have. Look at what's going on in California. They do better than our great veterans. They do better than citizens of our country. And they advertise, ""We will take you. We will take care of you. We will pay for it."" And then you wonder why we have so many people trying to come through at the borders. But we do a great job. We're removing these criminal illegal aliens from our country by the thousands. We're sending them home, and we're not letting them come back in. We're being very tough. Mexico is now giving us 27,000 soldiers at our border. And Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, we signed a very important agreement with each. When their people come into our country, they weren't taking them back. Now they take them back and they say, ""Thank you very much."" They weren't taking them back. If we had a murderer from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, we want to bring them back under past administrations. They bring them and they say, ""We don't want them. Don't land. You're playing with us."" They say, ""Thank you very much. We will take them back."" Because we've let them know the price is very bad if they don't do that. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossings are down 75% since May and the wall is going up at a very rapid pace. The radical Democrats have gotten more and more extreme. That's why they did this impeachment hoax, because Nancy Pelosi had absolutely no control. She knew what was going to happen. She knew. The radical left has taken over the Democrat party. Democrats are pushing for a socialist takeover of healthcare that would strip you of the doctor and coverage of your choice. We have 180 million people with private healthcare that love it. They're going to take it away from you. I don't think so. Crazy Elizabeth Warren, or as I affectionately call her, Pocahontas, her ridiculous plan would cost $52 trillion. That's more money than we take in in one year, two years, three years, four years, five years, six years, about seven years. That's for one year. $52 trillion. And you don't have your doctor. I mean, the whole… Well, she's starting to crash again. I thought I knocked her down. I did that heavy, heavy Pocahontas deal. I give her credit. I thought she was left for… I mean, there were just little embers, and then she rose. She rose, then she became strong. But then she opened that fresh mouth of hers and it stopped. It stopped. I don't see her as a threat. I don't think she makes it. I mean, you don't know. Crazy things are happening in the Democrat party. It used to be a sane party. Now it's an insane party. So you don't know. But they're all looking at the same thing. I mean, you have Alfred E. Neuman who's running, who's this guy. This guy Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Can you believe he's doing well? He's like the leading fundraiser. I dream about him. It's true. No, Buttigieg. But I'm not going too far with any of these people because I thought I was way too early with Elizabeth Warren. We destroyed her too fast. So she came back. But she's going back down again. Did anybody see her beer deal where she said, ""Darling."" Did you ever see that deal? Darling. It's about her husband. Darling, it's great to see you. What are you doing here? It's like, ""That's her husband, he's supposed to be living in the house. You're here."" I don't think she's seen him in 10 years. Hey, I have an idea. Can I get a beer? Let's get a beer. She wants to be one of the group. Hey, let's get a beer. Did you ever see such a phony, disgusting deal? Republicans will defend your sacred right to choose the doctor, and you can choose your plan, and you choose the plan that's right for you. We will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions. We will also protect your right to get the physician that you want. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth. This character in Virginia. Did you see the Virginia governor? I mean, he gave a whole expose. The baby is born, and then basically, they start talking to the mother. The baby is born. And there's no other word. If the mother decides no, then they execute the baby. Okay? He's the governor of Virginia and why the Republicans aren't going to win Virginia this next election, 2020. I'll tell you what, we're going to give it a very strong shot. When you have people like that, we're going to give it a very strong shot. But that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion. Because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the party of honest Abe Lincoln. Party of Abe Lincoln. I told you about judges. I'm telling you about so many other things. There's nobody that's ever done what we're doing. You look at school choice for every child in America who needs it, including the 50,000 Pennsylvania students who your Democrat governor has blocked from getting school choice scholarships. No scholarships available. What's that all about? How did that happen? I withdrew from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal, a disaster. I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Pennsylvania. You've never had that better year. Never At stake in our present battle is the survival of the American nation itself. It's the survival. We will destroy our country if these people get in. I say we've done so much in the first three years, will soon be four years. All of a sudden the time will be up. But it's like when you plant a tree, it needs time to grab on. It needs time to let it… It's got to grab. That's what we need. We need time. And we have other things we're going to do that are incredible. We still have tremendous regulation cutting that we can do. We've cut more regulations than any president in the history of our country. We did it in less than two and a half years. Two and a half years. We did it in less than two and a half years. Some had eight years, one had more than eight years. More regulation. And we have regulation, and you need some regulation, but you don't need regulation that doesn't allow you to build a simple road or highway. So what we've done has been incredible. That's one of the reasons our job numbers are so good. If you want your children to inherit the birthright of American Liberty that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020, and we have to get rid of the Democrats in the House of Representatives. They are stone cold crazy. Only this way can we save the America we love and clean up Washington corruption once and for all. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. We have tremendous prosperity going on in our country, and the people in this room are… I mean, you know what's happening. You know what's happening with your families. You know what's happening with your jobs. You've never had a time like this. They always say, ""Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"" I mean, who is better off now? Everybody, I think. Everybody. But together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, ""Made in the USA."" We just finished a deal with South Korea, a great new trade deal. We just finished a $40 billion deal with Japan. We're in the process of getting our deal done. Let's see what happens. They want to make it more than I do with because we're taking in a lot of money. We haven't taken in money from China ever, and it's coming in now by the billions. When they target our farmer, I give our farmers that money that they've been targeted and our farmers are thrilled. We have a lot leftover, but we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We'll have that done within 10 years. It could have started. That could have started earlier than the beginning of our administration. We'll have that done in less than 10 years. Think of that. The AIDS epidemic will have ended in America within less than 10 years. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, one great country. One America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, ""In God we trust."" We stand on the shoulders of generations of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. Pennsylvania's the place where our founding fathers declared American independence, where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, and where General George Washington led his men across the Delaware on Christmas night. They used the password. You know what the password was? Victory or death. Victory or death. How incredible is that? Victory or death. Pennsylvania is the state that gave us self-made titans of American industry, from Andrew Carnegie to Milton Hershey. I love Hershey. I love Hershey. And Henry J. Heinz. Pennsylvania is the place where strong American workers mine the coal, work the railroads, and forge the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world, and we are making it even greater every single day. It's greater than ever before. And proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. They are trying to take your power away. It will never ever happen. With your help, and with your devotion, and your drive we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are going to keep on winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. Ladies and gentlemen of Pennsylvania, the best is yet to come. Because together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you."
Trump,"Well, thank you very much. And hello Las Vegas. Great to be with you. They have a big election tomorrow. We've already won the state. We've already won. I like ours better. We just take it. Just take it. We've won it. I like it that better. You know they say they're going to have a lot of problems tomorrow. I hate to tell you this. I don't know. Have you heard? I hear their computers are all messed up. Just like they were in Iowa. They're not going to be able to count their vote. They're going to tell you about healthcare. They're going to tell you about our military and the jet fighters and the missiles and rockets, but they can't count votes. They just can't count them. They can't count votes, but they're saying they may not be able to do it again. They're still trying to tell us. I called up yesterday, how are they doing in Iowa? Was that two weeks ago? They say we're getting close. They're not getting close, they'll never know. They'll never know, but I hear the same thing could happen tomorrow. I hope it doesn't, actually. I hope it doesn't, but I'm delighted to be back in a state I love. I have a beautiful building right down the road. With the proud, hardworking patriots of Nevada. You're going to say Nevada. You say that wrong, you got problems. You say Nevada, they go, what the hell? Got to be Nevada. With your help this November, we're going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats and we are going to win Nevada in a big beautiful landslide. Now, we have some special people here, you know the special very special people. And we celebrate one of the greatest moments in the history of sports. Some people say it was the single greatest moment in the history of sports. It was called the miracle on ice. Do you remember that? That was when the Russians had a team assembled. That was probably, they say maybe the greatest team ever assembled. They were unbelievable. And our guys played a practice game with them was it a couple of weeks before, and I hate to tell you the score was 10 to 3, and the USA was not on top, and this team was an incredible team and they went in and it was amazing, but tomorrow marks the 40 years since the United States men's hockey team defeated then Soviet Union team in the 1980 Olympics. Incredible. That was incredible. Most of you remember that. I'm looking. We've got a lot of young ones, but we've got a lot of people that remember that. A lot of people. And by the way, we got the Olympics coming back or coming to Los Angeles. Thank you. Thank you President Trump. Thank you President Trump. Thank you very much. Thank you President Trump. Eight years. Eight years, 2028 you know what? Unless I'm still president then, which is a distinct possibility, I won't be here, and you know what they'll do? I'll say, how's the Olympics going? Does anybody have a ticket for the president that got the Olympics to come here? They'll say, I want to thank and they'll thank hundreds of people, but they won't thank you president that I'm the one that pulled it off. But that's okay. 2028 Olympics is coming to Los Angeles. It's going to be great. And we worked with the mayor of Los Angeles. He was great. He called up and we gave him a lot of help. I was president elect then because the president didn't want to get involved. He didn't want to get involved in getting the Olympics, so they called me and I was president elect, hadn't taken office. Then I got involved and I'll tell you, they were happy we got involved. It was great. It's going to be very exciting today. We are thrilled to have with us 14 players of that really incredible gold medal team. Give him a big hand. And they were amazed. They said, boy is a big crowd. I said, it's only because you guys are coming. This day was supposed to be for this evening. And I said, let me get back to Washington, do it early. So we gave you almost no notice. You have thousands of people outside, thousands of people inside. You had to see, we were in Iowa we were in New Hampshire. You saw what happened in Colorado last. That was unbelievable. Every place we go it's the same. It's been incredible. I don't know if you saw the pictures last night of the outside in Colorado. It was incredible. It was. You could have filled that arena up four times and it was a big arena, and it's something. So I hated to do it to you at 12 o'clock but I said, let's go. I want to get back. We got to deal with China. We got to deal with Russia. We got to deal with North Korea, South Korea. We got to deal with the rest of the world. Get my people back. We got to get the hell out of here, right? But we have a lot of time. I'd like now to invite these incredible sport legends to join me on stage. A friend of mine and a very good golfer, by the way, Captain Mike he rode a bike. Mike. Where's Mike? Where is he? Mike. Do you know who he is? He's a fake handicap is what he is. Say something Mike. Just welcome everybody to ironic we happen to be here to celebrate our 40th anniversary, the Vegas Knights flew the whole team out to honor us tonight and for the weekend and we obviously thank the people of Las Vegas for having us here and we're looking forward to celebrating a special time, and it's a great honor for the president to invite us to be part of this event as well. So Vegas, thanks for having us. But just tell them, am I a good athlete and am I a good golfer? Thanks Mike. That was some goaltending right? How many did you rebuff? I mean, but how many did Jim have? Many did. Very few. But a lot of shots, right? He was like a pinata. So Mike, that was great. Goaltender Jim Craig. So Jim rebuffed come here, Jim. Great goaltender, great goaltender. They didn't know what was happening. They kept shooting. He doesn't know how many you rebuffed. How many did you rebuff? 37. So let me ask you, was that as goaltender, because that was incredible. Was that the greatest game you ever played? You've had a lot of great games. But was that the greatest game you've ever played? It was slightly important. 37. 37. Bill Baker. Bill, come up. Bill Baker. Dave Christian, Ken Morrow, Jack O'Callahan, Mike Ramsey. Those legs took a beating. Mark Wells, Neil Brotton, John Harrington, Rob McClanahan, Buzz Schneider, Dave Silk, Phil Verchota, and a great coach and assistant coach at the time, Craig Patrick. They said four more years, 12 more years left for them. Look at that. Look at the press. Hey Mike, look at the fake news back there. It's a lot. I always say that's like the Academy Awards used to be. This year, we had a movie, they said best movie, they announced the movie from South Korea. I said, what's that all about? The movie was made in South Korea. Look, I get along great with South Korea, but you know, I never saw that one before. They used to go best foreign movie, but now we do it that way. I don't get it, but that's what it used to be and this is really an incredible time. I'll tell you what, for our country, that's why I like to see things that we do get honored because nobody is doing what we do. Nobody can do it like us. We're the greatest country in the world again. We have the greatest people. We have the greatest military by far. We've totally rebuilt our military. Jobs are booming, incomes are surging, poverty is plummeting. Factories are returning confidence is soaring, like these guys, the confidence is soaring, but you know, we do have somebody that I'd like to point out because this team is, they had a coach, and that coach was a very inspirational coach, would you say Mike? And I'd like to have maybe one of you come up and just say a few words about Coach Brooks because he was very, very, he was really a big, he was a big heart on this team. Please. Say something. So tell me one thing, one thing. So I see those tears. That means you think, you miss him and you love him. Right? Was he actually a nice guy? Because he looked tough. Mike was just saying he was brutal, but he was a good guy, right? Tough but great. Thank you very much. Thanks Kelly. Thank you all. Greatest sports story could be number one. So a lot of people, a lot of these sports experts, sports writers have voted that as the single greatest sporting event or athletic achievement. I think so, yeah? They put it number one, certainly top five. In the history of our country, we have a lot of things that we've done to break records. We're going to go over them, but we've broken a lot of records now, but I want to thank that great team for being with us. Very inspirational. This is a big day. The anniversary. Thank you fellas. Thank you. In my state of the union address, I proudly declare that we are in the midst of the great American comeback and we're just getting started. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and partisan Democrat crusades. By the way, I think they're starting another one. Did you see that? I see these phoneys. These are the do nothing Democrats. They said today that Putin wants to be sure that Trump gets elected. Here we go again. Here we go again. Did you see it? A story. Aren't people bored? Now, does that include because a couple of weeks ago, crooked Hillary said Chelsea Gabbard, right. Tulsi Gabbard and right? She was a Russian agent. Tulsi and also Stein from Jill Stein. I don't know Jill Stein. I never met the woman. She is a Green Party candidate or was they said she's an agent of Russia. I don't know her and I don't know Tulsi. The only thing I know about both of them is they're not agent. They are not agents of Russia. These people are sick. That's pencil neck, pencil neck again. Little pencil. No, I just see it again. I was told that was happening. I was told a week ago. They said they're trying to start a rumor. It's disinformation. That's the only thing they're good at. They're not good at anything else. They get nothing done. Do nothing Democrats. That Putin wants to make sure get elected. Listen to this. So doesn't he want to see who the Democrat's going to be? Wouldn't you rather have, let's say Bernie? Wouldn't he rather that Bernie who honeymooned in Moscow? Wouldn't that be? These people are crazy. That's all they think about. They don't think about the country. They don't think about jobs. They don't think about lowering your drug costs. Infrastructure. These people are crazy. Trust me, I like what we're doing and I love this country. I love this country. Now, and I campaigned on it, at the same time we want to get along with Russia, we want to get along with China, we want to get along with all these countries. Who the hell needs to have conflict? But these people are sick, they are sick people. The radical left's attempts to poison our democracy and overturn the last election have totally ended in a big fat failure. And by the way, you saw today, single best day I've ever had is the polls and any poll that the fake news gives you, because the real numbers are higher, but any poll they give you as a fake. But Wisconsin, the great state of Wisconsin, I was leading by many, many, many points against every one of these characters. Can you believe it? We got a new one. Mini Mike. How did he do in the debate the other day? Mini Mike. Here's a box Mike. Here Mike. Mini Mike. He was a beauty. What happened huh? He couldn't breathe. What happened? Mike would like to know how about that Pocahontas screaming at him. She forgot. She forgot that she lied about her own heritage. She said she was an Indian because she had high cheekbones. That was the only thing. Remember what I said, I have more Indian blood in me than she has and I have none. Right? I have none. To the best of my knowledge, wouldn't mind having some, but I happen to have none. And she choked and she went out and got a report done. One, 1 thousandth and 24 you know what that means? That means probably I do have more. Now why did he bring that up when she was screaming at him? Why? Because he was gasping for breath. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. She's hitting me too hard. Pocahontas. Well, she won that debate cause Mike could not respond. That's what they all said. They all said that. That's funny. I won, they're all shouting. It's not me that's saying it. Fake news. You fake news people. No, they all said it though. Who won the debate? Trump. You know what? The way I look at it, when fake news CNN oops, there goes the camera off. Red light just went off. See, I can tell every one of them. I know them by heart. I know the operators. I know the camera men. They're okay. They're all on our side by the way. They're screamed at. Get that camera off. I don't want to do that. Get that camera off, or it's going to be you job. All right, I'm sorry. Precedent. But how bout MSDNC? They're worse than CNN. And they're owned by people that really are bad. I think they're very bad for our country. The owners of Comcast, rotten company, bad for our country, very bad. They try, they have all these PR things to try and keep their image nice and clean. What they do on television is so disgusting. I think in the old days you had to have licenses for this stuff, right? They can say whatever they want to say. Let's see what happens over the next period of time. Bunch of dishonest people. Comcast, terrible company. Terrible people running that company. And you know what, I had Celebrity Apprentice, I had the Apprentice on for 14 seasons, 14 seasons, and they used to come to my office and they would kiss my ass. Please sign. Please. Please sign. It's an interesting story. They came and we signed, you know who signed me, Jeff Zucker. It's one of the only things he's done good in broadcasting, but I signed and NBC, as you know, is owned by Comcast, but I signed and they figured the show would be a total failure. So they only signed me for one season. You know I was going to have it. It was go on and then the show goes, started at ten went to eight, went to seven, went to five, went to four, went to two. It went to one. I had the number one show in all of television. Number one. It was a phenomenal and the final episode, remember that? With the, you remember that? Do you remember the final? We had, I don't know, it was one of the biggest shows of the year. It was a tremendous success there. But here I was, I signed with NBC and they didn't even want to waste the ink on an option. Usually they have an option for not, you know, just like they didn't do it. You stupid people. So they paid me very little for the first season I think $25,000 a show, which is considered not good. That's okay. It was fun. I didn't know it was going to be success, you know? Hey, just like this was successful. It's a recent. Because when I left and Arnold Schwarzenegger and I like Arnold said some very nice things, so I'm not, but the show did not exactly succeed when I left, but I had it on and they wanted me to sign for more and I said, no, I'm going to run for president but I'll never forget. I looked at, I didn't know anything about this business and I had an agent, wonderful guy from William Morris, and he said, sir, I don't want you to sign. No business show has ever done well on network television. Well, it's not business, it's entertainment, celebrity. Sir, I don't want you to sign. Sir, don't sign. I said, yeah, okay. But I have a problem. I shook the hand of somebody I have to. And Mark Burnett was great. He was my guy and but we shook hands. So I have to, but I agreed, you know, I didn't know that no business or no business type show had ever succeeded on a network television. So he said, I don't want you to sign sir, break it. I said, I can't break it. Can't break it. Anyway, so the show I said started at ten, went to nine, went to became, it was the number one show all of a sudden, and the agent called me up and he said, sir, I remember it was six in the morning. I was in bed. He said, sir, the show just went to number one. I'd love to see you because I think I'm entitled to more money. I said, you didn't want me to do the show. Well, not really. I mean, I was okay. He said, I'd really like more money. I said, Jim, I like you very much, Jim, you're fired. Get out. Anyway, I had 14 great seasons over about 11 years because it was so successful, they kept… They would have run it. Remember when they did the three hours, the whole night was the Apprentice. I said, wait a minute. Gone With the Wind, to mention the movie a second time, Gone With the Wind is shorter. They had the Apprentice on for three hours. I said even I think it's too long. You can't put it up for three. You got leave a little bit like I want to come back next week. But they had it on for three weeks. We did fantastically with it. Comcast did great. NBC did great. They wanted me to sign for another three years. I said, no, I'm going to for president. And that was actually the time when I knew I was going to run. Because you know how they were paying a lot of money and whether you're rich or not, it's still a lot of money. I don't care how rich you are. It's a lot. Millions and millions of dollars. And I said no, I'm going to run for president. And I did that. But from the day I ran, they went from being, you know one… But from the day I ran, they went from being wonderful, they were nice. They were nice. I guess if I didn't do well with the show they wouldn't have been nice because they weren't nice to other people that failed. People that didn't have good ratings, that business is a very simple business. If you have good ratings, you can treat them like garbage. If you have bad ratings, you can say, ""Sir, I really respect you so much."" Get out of here. Get him out of my yard. They're very ruthless people. But Comcast is a rotten company. They forgot totally. And they are worse than CNN. I will tell you that right now. Comcast is worse than CNN. We should call it Comcast, because that's their beautiful maiden name, Comcast. They're worse than CNN. I'll, tell you something about CNN. Jake Tapper, today he put out… Now I know you don't like him. I know. Who likes him? Who the hell can like him? I think his wife likes him. Actually. I really believe she does. But let me just tell you, he put out a couple of social media posts today, because I never call it tweet, I call it social media because it's much bigger than tweet. What we have, Dan Scavino. The great Dan Scavino. We have won five sites. We're number one on Twitter, we're number one on Facebook, and the whole world. The whole world. So it's powerful. But Jake Tapper put out some things, basically saying, I believe it, that's the way I read it, that the new Russian thing that started yesterday, that Putin wants to be sure that Trump, which give me a break. Give me a break. But Jake Tapper said it ain't so, and if he did say that because they were a little complex, they can turn them around, or when Zucker sees him and said, ""Why did you put that? I want that deleted and I want you to do a different one."" But he did say that. So I respect that because it's another hoax story. But we're standing up for the defense of our constitution, for our freedom, and democracy itself. You know that. I got to get that. Hey, Bobby? Bobby? See that guy? I love that shirt. Bobby, I don't know. He looks like a nice guy. Can you please walk him up, even if you have about five. Come here, come here. Come here. Come here. You got to see this shirt. You got to see this shirt. I love it. I've got to order me one that I can ride around. Come on. Come on up here. He looks safe. He doesn't look like he's going to start a fist fight. He's a good fan, I guess. You got to see this shirt. I love it. Is there any place that's more fun than a Trump rally? Right? How many rallies have you been to? 80? 80? 80. He said 80 rallies. Come up here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Look at these two guys. These guys are serious. These are serious fans, right? Are you with him? Are you with him? Are you with him? You're with him? Come on. Come up here. Man. And look at this guy Come on. Thank you, fellas. Wow. I just said, ""How long have you two been together?"" I figured they'd say, ""We're married."" He met her at the rally in Colorado. Can you believe this? Can you believe it? Man, did he get lucky. They both got lucky, right? They both got lucky. Well, that's cool. No, I just see there's so much stuff out here. It's genius, actually. While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with viral hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. As you heard, we added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. Way above anticipated schedule. And that makes 7 million new jobs since the election. The number was supposed to be under 2 million and we added 7 million. And remember, if I give you wrong numbers, the fake news is going to have headlines. ""Trump gave you wrong…"" I mean, it's very tough. I've got to be very careful. Even if I give you wrong in the wrong way, they'll say it was wrong. I said, ""Yeah, but it was wrong in the low way."" No, that's no good either. Got to be very precise with these characters. The Democrats don't have to be, but we have to be. We've destroyed he ISIS territorial caliphate 100%, we killed the founder and leader of ISIS. Al Baghdadi is dead. Al Baghdadi is dead. 17 years. They looked for him. 17 years. Al-Baghdadi. One of the first things I did when I came in. He's the founder of ISIS and when I came in three years ago, ISIS was all over the place. And I said, ""You got to knock it out."" We knocked it out of Syria, and, Iraq and other places. We really knocked at 100%. Remember I wanted to leave. I said, ""All right."" We were at 96%, then 98, then 99%. I said, ""Let some of these other countries do it."" Wouldn't you say, right? So what happened is I wanted to leave and they said, ""No, no, no, we want 100%."" So we wait and stayed. We got 100%, then we moved them all out of Syria, except we did keep the oil. You noticed that, right? We kept the oil. Sorry. They said, ""He left soldiers in Syria."" Yeah, I did to keep the oil, if you don't mind. Which is what we should have done in Iraq too, by the way. I would have done that. I'm making a lot of money with all that oil. But you remember that whole thing, that whole… I said, ""You got to find Al Baghdadi."" I've been saying that actually for two years. I had a lot of other things to do the first year, like fight off the Democrats. These crazy Democrats with their hoaxes. Think of it. If they use their genius, because they are genius at that stuff, right? They're really good. They can take nothing. They can take a perfect phone call made to the Ukrainian president who said very specifically there was no pressure. He doesn't even know what's going on and they can take this perfect call. Thank goodness I had a transcriber. Do you agree with it? Because the fake whistleblower said that the call was totally different than what the call was. So when I released the call, when I released the transcripts, they died. They said, ""Oh we got a problem."" They never thought I was going to do it, but I had no choice. I had to because I had to show they're liars. But think of it, they can take something like that, a perfect phone call, or they'll take just out of thin air they can make something up. And they ended up today, front page, New York Times. They used to call it the eighth column. That's the big column on the right. I don't know. The papers become so small. I don't know if they have an eighth column anymore. They used to have the eighth column, was a big deal, right? That was the big deal. Today it's too narrow. Think they're probably… After I'm gone, they won't have any columns. That's why eventually they're going to support me. Eventually, the Times and the Washington post, which will be dead as a doornail after I leave, and the CNN, it'll be an obsolete business, the cable business. MSDNC will be out of business. You know, cable was supposed to be obsolete and now they're doing the highest numbers they've ever done. If an airplane goes down with 700 people, they don't cover it. If it's not Trump related, they don't cover it. It's got to be Trump or Trump related. So if a plane goes down and it's total devastation, if the ship goes down, if the Titanic- If the Titanic equivalent went down, they wouldn't cover it unless I was on the sucker. It's true. They wouldn't cover it. The fake news would not cover the equivalent of the Titanic. But you know what they're going to do before the election? They're going to say, ""We want to just say something. We're going to endorse the president."" You know why? Because they'll be out of business. Can you imagine if they had to cover mini Mike? Who I don't think, I think he's gone, but you know what? He'll spend another 500 million. Don't forget I spent 70 and I won, of my money. In other words, they said, and this was in the New York Times, I said the other night in Colorado. I spent 70, mini Mike so far has spent almost $500 million dollars in order to get embarrassed by Pocahontas. Pocahontas. And she's mean, isn't she? Did you see that? Do you see the anger on her face? That nervous energy. She's jumping up and down. She's a mess. But no, no, she's mean. Right? Right? That face is just… ""You want to get him?"" She said, ""I got him. I want to see those agreements."" ""I,"" ""You open up those agreements."" This poor guy probably signed a hundred of them and each one's a disaster. He said, ""I don't want to open those agreements. Nobody told me this was going to happen."" Said, ""Actually, sir."" ""Nobody told me. Get me out of here."" After the debate, he went backstage, fired a lot of people. He said, ""How the hell did you get me into this thing?"" But Pocahontas was really mean, but she's going to be easy. I hope it's her. It's not going to be her. Can't be, I don't think. Alfred E. Neuman, ladies and gentlemen, introducing president Alfred E. Neuman. Nobody knows because you're all too young. Nobody knows who Alfred… it's Mad Magazine. They all said… No. Howdy Doody. See nobody knows who Alfred E. Neuman is. Only the real aficionados. They're the ones and they love it. But that's only 15% of the crowd, right? Am I right? Better than Howdy Doody. Howdy Doody. And that's what happens when you can't get the words out. No it does. That's what happens, right? When you can't get the words out, you get angry. You get angry because you can't get the words. That might happen to me someday. Can you imagine if that happened to me? Man, would I be a bad guy. I'd be the meanest man in history. No, but Biden is very angry. He gets angrier, and angrier, and angrier. He's changed. And then you have the Tom. Yeah. He said Tom Steyer. Tom said, "" Mister impeachment."" How did that work out, Tom? Thank you very much for the great poll numbers between him and nervous dancing. How did that work out? This schmuck spends $250 million dollars, he ends up with one third of a percent in Iowa. But maybe that could be Rick, because they still don't have any idea what he got. Maybe he won Iowa, they took it away from him. No, but he was substantially below it. All I know, it said 1% and an arrow left. So he spends 250 million, Tom Steyer. Never heard of this guy. Who is he? Where did he get his money? Who is he? He was in the coal business, did you know that? This guy, this phony is a big environmentalist. He made his money, a lot of it, in the coal business. Nobody knows that, but he's a fake. Remember when he walked up to Bernie the other day. ""Hi Bernie. Hi."" Oh, and he was having a fight with Pocahontas, right? Is this the greatest? Mark Burnett said, ""This is the greatest reality show in history."" He said, ""You can take The Apprentice, and you can take Survivor, and you can take every other reality show ever made, multiply it times 10,000, and you still don't have what we have. And even the CAS."" He did say this. You got the perfect president. You got the perfect first lady. How about the first lady? You got the perfect kids. The kids, though. Those beautiful kids. My beautiful kids. They had such a great life, before I did this. Sorry, kids. Sorry. My beautiful Ivanka. She had such a great life. She Had a company that was selling shoes and everything you could sell. She'd just put her name on it and she said, ""Daddy, does it matter? I want to come to Washington and help people get jobs."" Right? Ain't that true? And she left the company. And when you leave a company, all of a sudden it doesn't do as well. I wouldn't say that I exactly helped talking about the wall and other things, but she left the company, came to Washington and she said 500,000 jobs. That was her goal. And she did that in the first month. She actually did. She's gotten these great companies like Walmart, and many others, Exxon, she's gotten them to take millions of people. She's now over 15 million jobs where they train people and bring them into the companies. It's incredible. 15 million. And she's smart. She got it figured out, but most people can't, but she does. But all they do is give them heat. They work so hard. And could you imagine you take Biden's son. Can you imagine? But you know what? We don't do any of that stuff. We don't do that stuff. We don't do it. The kid got $3 million dollars, 83,000 a month and he didn't have a job until his father became vice president. And speaking of vice presidents and speaking also of reality television, because it's the greatest show of all time, right? Look at us. Look. We told you, what, last night? Little change here, folks. We're going to move it up from eight o'clock in the evening until 12 o'clock in the afternoon. Little change. Just a minor change. Because I have to get back to Washington to work. I feel guilty. This is too much fun. But speaking to vice presidents and speaking of perfect vice presidents, if you become president, the first thing you have to do is choose a really horrible, horrible vice president. So if the idiots ever want to impeach you, they have to say, I can't impeach him. Look who we have. I have the perfect vice president. I have the greatest in the world. I have the greatest vice president. I don't know. I got the great ones. I said, ""I can't do that."" I picked a great guy. He's done a fantastic job. He's been a great vice president. But it is true. I could have picked, I'll give you names, but don't want to do that because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. But there are plenty of them out there. They're mostly out there and I don't want to do that. But Mike Pence has been great. But tell me, is it perfect casting the whole thing? And this isn't about casting, this is about real life. But when Mark Burnett said to me the other day, he said, ""The greatest reality show of all times, times of million."" That's exactly except for one thing, we work our asses off and we are doing things like nobody has ever done before. Right? Right? So, we took out Al Baghdadi and then we just took out two weeks ago the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani of Iran, ending his evil reign of terror forever. He's the father of the roadside bomb. When you see our beautiful people walking around with no legs, they're walking, and trying to walk so hard, and they're really in rough shape he's the father of the… he loved the roadside bomb. He thought it was a great thing. Where is he now? Soleimani. And I'll tell you what, you know who's happy about it? The people of Iran are happy and even the leaders of Iran, because the leaders of Iran were afraid of him. Okay? And the fact is, America is respected again. We're winning. We're winning all over. We're winning in Washington that Democrats keep losing their minds. That is why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement. Look, we're a unified party. The Republican party has never been unified like it is today. I'll show you. I could say, ""We're going to go over to the Hill. No, we're going to go over to someplace and we're going to do a rally at eight o'clock tonight."" We'd have tens of thousands of people there. There's never been this. Ronald Reagan was great. I thought he was a great guy, great president, didn't like his policy on trade. That's okay. Trade. But if he came to Las Vegas, you know they'd have a ballroom, and they'd have 500, maybe a thousand people. What we're doing… And this isn't even, I must say this, I don't want to tell you this, this is not election season. Because we're nine months away. Election season is when you're two months away. We're not even in election season and we have more enthusiasm now. Believe it or not, then we had even before the election in 2016. It's true. It's too early. It's too early. It's true. We have a great gentleman and a woman with us, a friend of mine, mister and misses Sheldon Adelson, right over here. Great, great person. Two great people. He's got so much money, he doesn't know what the hell to do with it. He owns the Sands Hotel. That's like one of the smaller businesses. Sheldon, that's like your small business, right? He is a great guy. She's an incredible, she's a doctor, and she studies addiction, and drugs, drug addiction, all sorts of addictions. And she knows more about that subject, I think, than anybody, and she works hard and she doesn't need it. He does not need the money that she brings in. Okay? He also happens on the paper. He owns the paper. You own the paper in town, right? They wanted like a couple of hundred million dollars too much. You said, ""Give it to them. It's peanuts. What the hell difference does it make? We want to thank the Adelsons. They've been incredible fans and they love Israel. They love Israel. I just saw him sitting there. I didn't know they were here. I just see him sitting there. He's something. The chairman of the Nevada Republican party, who's really been great. He's been with me for a long time and he's a very committed man. Make America great again. Oh, oh, oh. Let's do a poll quick. Just quick. I'll never get rid of MAGA because I'm superstitious. But we just hit an all time high with the stock market. Our military is rebuilt. You just got the greatest tax cuts in history, the greatest rate, regulation cuts, and all this stuff. So, let me ask you this. So, ""Make America great again,"" it sort of doesn't work quite as well. So now we have keep America great and we have the new hat. It's higher, stiff. It's like a billboard, right? I call it the billboard. It's a billboard. So let's go just that. Because I am very surprised by it. We're going to keep them both, but I just curious if we did go to one, ""Make America great again?"" "" Keep America great?"" I can't. I would have said that's impossible. ""Make America great again,"" is the greatest phrase. A lot of people, again, fake news, I think will agree to it. It's the greatest phrase ever used in politics. It's the greatest phrase. Now, who has the greatest phrase ever used in the history of politics and say, ""Oh, let's go with a new phrase."" Right? But we're going to keep it. So we have to keep MAGA. But now we have CAG, now we have CAG. So we have a both. I just don't have the courage to get rid of the one. It would be too disrespectful. Too disrespectful. But Michael McDonald, I want to thank you and the members of the Nevada Republican central committee. You're all here. They're great people. And the man came here. He loves us. He's been with us. Rick Harrison of the world famous gold and silver pawn shop. Rick Harrison. You better win, Michael. Otherwise, that's the last time I'm introducing you like that. I hear we're up. I hear we're doing nicely. I hear we're doing great. And by the way, the union, I have a lot of respect for that union. Last time, I had a strike in my building during the election. It's the only reason we would have won this state. Brilliantly to save three cents. I could have settled the strike before the election. I wanted to save $2 total. And he wasn't too good. He didn't do too good. But we almost won this state despite… I had a big strike. Had thousands and thousands of union guys. They had it, look, they wanted, wanted to show us. But I think that the unions are really with us and the unions have been with us. They're Teamsters, so many of the unions. Because I'm for the working man and woman, whether you're union or non-union. Some States are all union, some states are no union. But we get them all. And I think we're going to have tremendous success. And a lot of the Democrats are going to ruin the healthcare programs that these unions have. The unions have worked hard on healthcare and they're going to ruin them. They're going to take away… Well, we're going to… you can lose 180 million people off of great private healthcare. So we'll see what happens. But a lot of the Democrats want to do that. They think it's wonderful. But together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society. That's true. Since my election, over 125- That's true. Since my election, over 125,000 new jobs have been created right here in Nevada, including over 40,000 new Nevada manufacturing and construction jobs. A 30% increase. The national unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century, and soon we're going to have that be a historic number like so many of the others. The average unemployment rate for my administration, this is the coolest of them all, is the lowest for any United States president in recorded history. That's pretty good. When I'm in a debate, they're saying, ""we're going to do this."" I say, ""listen, we have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country."" African American unemployment, Hispanic American. Hispanic, we got a lot of Hispanic. I love Hispanic. Who in this audience is Hispanic? Yeah, we're doing great. Well, we should be doing great. You have the lowest unemployment rates ever recorded. Asian Americans, likewise the lowest ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest rate in 71 years. African American youth unemployment has reached an all time historic low. People I love, people I might've helped more than anybody because of choice and accountability. The veteran's unemployment rate drop to the lowest record. Lowest in history. The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all time historic low and you got to remember they're back there checking every word. They're going,"" oh, my god. He's right."" I can't say it because I got all these maniacs back there. They're trying to find… ""He put the comma in the wrong place. He didn't make that word plural, therefore he lied."" Now I've got to be very accurate because all these numbers, they check them out. ""They're in there, checking them out. Check on the African American unemployment, please."" Please tell me it's not historic. These people are among the most dishonest human beings on earth. Not all of them. Workers without a high school diploma. We have millions of people that didn't go through high school. They left. They had problems, good problems, bad problems, families where they don't have the money. They didn't get a high school diploma. They've achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in the history of the United States. Those are important groups of people. Half a million more Hispanic Americans now own a home. Now, Hispanic have done so good. And by the way, you know who understands the border, because we are building that wall like crazy. Remember, they also said, ""if you build the wall you'll lose the Hispanic vote."" I said, ""I got to do what's right. You know who understands the border better than anybody? You know who understands crime at the border better than anybody? The Hispanics understand it and they don't want to be working and have people come and take their job. Have people come in where they can't pay for their house, have people come in who are very bad people."" You have some very bad people. You have murderers and rapists, and we have set all sorts of records at the border, but we're up to 122 miles of wall, and it is true. The people that understand it the best are Hispanic. So, thank you. We got to make our country safe. We've lifted 10 million people off of welfare. Median household income is now the highest ever recorded in our country. Think of that. I say it all the time. President Bush, eight years, $450. President Barack Hussein Obama, eight years, $ 975. President Donald John Trump, three years. It's actually less when they did the numbers. Three years, including the big tax cuts that we got you and the regulation cuts. Three years. So, you had 450, 975, that's eight and eight. Now we're down to three years, a little less, three years, $ 10,000 per family a year. 10,000 a year. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American liberty and ending the tyranny of federal bureaucrats. I deal with them. They're not good. It's called the swamp. We've ended the war on American energy, lowering utility bills, reducing prices at the pump, reducing your prices. Part of that number is all of the money that we save at the pump and on electric. I also recently took action on an issue Nevada has been dealing with for over 30 years. Yucca mountain. You know Yucca mountain? My budget stops funding for the licensing of waste storage at Yucca mountain, so that we can focus on positive solutions and for much better reasons and alternatives. Why should you have nuclear waste in your backyard? I won't say which countries, but you know what other countries do? I will not say which ones. They put it on a ship. They float it out into the middle of the ocean. They find a nice deep spot and they dump it. That's the end of it. But we would never do that for environmental reasons. We are reversing decades so Yucca mountain… You're okay, please. Okay. Just relax. Sheldon, do you have somebody at your newspaper back there who can write. Yucca mountain, please. He'll call up, ""Yucca mountain is okay."" That's the end of that. So Yucca mountain, you're in great shape. Maybe they can finally report it properly, but we're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. For years, Washington politicians took money from lobbyists, global corporations and corrupt special interest to ship our jobs and factories and all of this stuff and all of this wealth. They stole our wealth. They shipped it overseas and to other countries. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO, the world trade organization. Probably an even worse deal for us than NAFTA, if that's possible, but under my administration, the great betrayal of America is over. America is no longer for sale. Last month we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S., Mexico, Canada agreement USMCA. See, we played the song YMCA because that's the only way you'll remember. Just think of the song YMCA. Think of the song and you'll remember that USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Nevada. I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of America jobs. Our strategy worked. Last month, we signed a ground breaking trade agreement. Probably the biggest agreement of any kind ever signed with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property and boost American exports by a lot. China will be buying $250 billion worth of goods from us now and 50 billion from our farmers. My guys wanted 16, I said, ""make it 50."" My guys wanted 16, they got China up to 20. I said, ""Nope. Got to make it 50,"" and then I said to China, ""you got a billion and a half people. What difference does it make?"" They said, ""you're right."" 50 billion, I don't think our farmers can produce that much, but we're going to soon find out. They're going to buy very large tractors. After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. we are finally putting America first. Or no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration. Before I came into office, the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, poisoning our children, including right here in a very big way. The great state of Nevada. Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. You know that, you've been complaining about it for a long time. It's one of the reasons you voted for Trump. They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border and then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, of healthcare, of lots of other things, including education. All paid for by the taxpayers of the United States. Illegal immigration costs Nevada taxpayers, think of it, more than $1.6 billion every year, over $1,500 per household. For the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild every city, all of these distressed areas in the United States, throughout our country. The money spend, it's not even thinkable and don't forget when we say come, like in California the clown, he says, ""come, we'll give you free healthcare."" People that weren't even thinking about coming. That's why we have caravans of people that we're turning back. Mexico's been great. By the way, they gave us 27,000 soldiers on our border. But when a governor, nice guy actually, he's a nice guy. We just got to explain the facts of life. He's a nice guy. Oh doctor, please. Doctor in the house, please. Medical, please. A doctor. Thank you. Take your time. We've got plenty of time. Yeah, take your time please. A lot of these people have been here for three days. It's a lot. Those front row people are tough. Take your time, doc. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, doctor. That's true. They get here so… They stand and sit and sometimes days early. In Colorado, they're there three, four days early. It's tough. And we work it and make sure that you have everything you want. Number one, we cover the facts and number two, we want to have a good time because we have to have a good time. But things like that happen a lot because after two, three days, it's not easy and these are strong people. I'm not going to fight any of them, okay? Now, amazing people. Thank you very much. Under my administration, we're finally taking care of our own citizens first, including millions of illegal immigrants who follow our laws, pay their taxes, lift up our society, and are entitled to a government that protects their families and protects their communities. Every day, Democrats' open border policies are harming and killing innocent people. You know what's happening, you know what's going on. In this region alone last year, ICE officers, and they're patriots. They're strong, tough patriots. If we didn't have them. They remove thousands and thousands of MS13 gang members a year and plenty of others. Who else is going to do it? ICE officers arrested over 5, 000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses, including robbery, rape, and even murder. Many murders. In Western Nevada, an illegal alien was charged with robbing and brutally executing four victims last year. Right here in Las Vegas, three MS13 gang members abducted a man, tied him up with his shoelaces, shot him repeatedly, and hacked him to death with a machete. You know exactly what I'm talking about. It's right here in your place, in Las Vegas, right here. Tied up and hacked him to death. Yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens, even convicted criminals and murderers, and they support deadly sanctuary cities. I say this all the time and I just… How the hell, where are they coming from? I don't get it right. Seriously, I don't get it. Sanctuary cities imperil American lives by releasing dangerous criminal aliens directly into your communities. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote Republican in 2020. And you have some great ones here, Michael. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row. And as the wall gets longer, it gets easier and easier. Remember when the Democrats were saying, ""you don't need a wall."" Two things that never change, right? All these computers, they said, ""use drones."" Oh great, we'll fly over with drones. Watch the people pour in by the thousands. That's great. Use drones. Before I came along, they all wanted a wall. They just didn't know how to build it. They had no clue. They had the money, they actually gave the money back, but they had no clue. But as soon as I came in and I said, ""Wall,"" they went against and I made a terrible mistake. We catch them. You know the story. They come over, could be a killer, murderer, rapist. They come over. We can't do anything. We have to be politically correct. We catch them. We then say, ""what's your address?"" They don't know. They don't even know their country in many cases. Where do you come from? We don't know and they mean it, but some are very serious criminals. So, we catch them, we take whatever they can take, which is nothing, and then we had to release them in our country. We can't bring them back. And then we have a system of judges, thousands of judges all over the place. You got to be like Perry Mason and every illegal that comes in, they have the lawyers. The lawyers meet them, they get paid fees, but we're breaking the system. No more catch and release, you think that was easy? And the big thing is that 30 foot… And this wall is built exactly to the specifications of border patrol. Totally. And border patrol has seized the largest amount, just recently, of deadly narcotics ever recorded. The largest amount. We've deported record numbers of gang members. We've done more to secure the border than any administration in history. We are, as I said, building the wall faster than ever. Faster and bigger than anyone thought possible. They can't believe we're getting it done. We'll have over 500 miles of wall built sometime next year. 500 miles. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now. 132 congressional Democrats have now signed up for Bernie Sanders takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million Americans, many of them in this room, of their private coverage. Remember president Obama? Remember, he said, ""you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan."" 28 times, he lied, so we should impeach him. We're going to impeach him. We'll do a belated impeachment. 28 times, ""you can keep your doctor,"" right? Remember, you could keep your doctor. Unfortunately, when they found out you can't keep your doctor, he said, ""I was just kidding."" Now, we should impeach him. We'll do a belated impeachment. Fake news, you have it. See, you have to be very careful when you say impeachment because you know what they do? They go back and they write. President Trump said that Obama should be impeached, but he's not in office and so therefore they can't impeach. He doesn't know what he's talking about because he's not in office, so therefore they can't. So, you have to be very careful. That's why I use the word belated impeachment. Belated, meaning I'm just kidding, okay? They do it all the time. They had it the other day. I said, ""bring back Gone With The Wind,"" right? I said a little bit up here, but I said the movie the other day in Colorado, I guess. I said, ""Huh, South Korean movie won."" They said, ""ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the Academy Award is …"" A movie made in South Korea, what's this all about? And I deal with them, they like me. We're helping them a lot. They're killing us on trade. They beat us on trade and then they win the Academy Award for a fricking movie. But we redid that trade deal, but the other day they got me on this one too. I said, ""whatever happened to Gone With the Wind, that beautiful movie? Vivian Lee, Clark Gable, right? Whatever happened, bring back Gone With the Wind."" And some of them wrote, ""he doesn't know that that movie was made in 1936."" He says fake news. It is fake news, they're fakers. But now, anybody sitting there reading this saying, ""man, Trump, can't be that smart. He said bring back Gone With the Wind. That's an old movie."" Yeah, it's an old classic. What I say is make great movies, not this computerized garbage. And I was never a fan of Brad Pitt, I will tell you that. No, I thought he was a stiff. He was a stiff, it's like a boring guy. All of a sudden he wins the Academy Award, so fitting. Their ratings aren't so good at the Academy Awards. You know when that stopped? When they started attacking us, their ratings went right down the tubers. I told somebody, the evening newscasts, they're terrible for conservative people and they're crooked, they're absolutely dishonest. I said to one of the big broadcasters, I'm friendly with him. I said, ""if you ever did a conservative newscasts, instead of… you got, ABC is terrible. NBC is just absolutely atrocious."" And they do badly. Not a lot of people are watching. They used to, when we had the late, great Walter Cronkite and these legends, right? But ABC is terrible and NBC is terrible and CBS is terrible. They're all the same. And I said, ""your ratings stink. If you would do a newscast that's conservative, I'd get them a host. I could recommend guys right now, right? I'd get them a host. We'll call up… Don't take Sean Hannity away from us. Don't take our show. That's my problem, I don't want to take away any of our people. You get a Pete Hegseth. You get a Jesse Waters. You get… I could name so many of them, right? And you put them on that broadcast, their ratings would go up five fold but they don't know that. I don't know. They're stupid. Their ratings would go through the roof, but they would rather have a failed broadcast that nobody watches than put on a conservative person and lift the ratings five times. They would rather have a fail… Seven months ago we had a little skit, and they were hoping the market would crash because they would rather lose their money, or big parts of it, and have a really horrible market on the basis that we, not me, we could not be elected on November 3rd. This is how crazy- … on November 3rd. This is how evil, this is how crazy they are. They've gone crazy. I guess you call it Trump derangement syndrome. But if they ever did a conservative broadcast, meaning very fair, very honest When I say that, it's almost like do a fair broadcast. Just a fair broadcast. That thing would be the hottest show. But they don't realize it. And if they do, they probably wouldn't do it anyway because they don't want to go away from what they're doing, which is crazy because it is, they're doing very poorly. While the social and socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare and your Social Security, they're putting it at risk, my administration is protecting your Social Security. Remember they said, four years ago in the debates and you had this crazy woman. I mean, I hate to mention her name. I did it you know, yesterday. I threw all the runs, hates it. She's a zero. It's got zero television personality. Aero AB Stoddard, whoever that is. She said, ""Donald Trump lost all of his debates."" I won every debate and maybe, I don't know maybe one somebody, but I won with tremendous numbers. He says, ""You always won."" I'm not sure. We try, I'll tell you that and we're winning now. But this crazy woman who's got zero going, zero. She said, ""Donald Trump lost his debates that he won."" You know, she was talking about how badly Benny Mike did. So she said, ""Well, Donald Trump."" No, I won every single debate. I won them against crooked Hillary. I won them in the primaries like 15 or 16 debates. And for some reason, you know, sometimes you do say, it's not a big deal. Nobody watches it. Nobody cares. Nobody even knows who she is. I just made her famous, right? She's nothing. She's nothing. She's got no talent, got nothing. She's probably got a little drive. That's how she keeps getting on television. Other people don't have her drive. But you know what? I said, ""That's really unfair."" So I took out the polls, Time magazine, Drudge, good guy, Drudge, Drudge. We took out a lot of different things and we put up the Drudge poll, the Time magazine and many others. And some of them had to be down to like at 91% and they didn't have many people and I can't really show up because many of those people are now great friends of mine. Some of them are great Republican senators. I'm not going to show results, but I'm holding it up just quickly glancing. I call it a glancing blow, but we won the debates and I have this fake news person saying, ""Donald Trump did very poorly in the debates."" I want every debate easily. I never did it before. Remember my first question? I said, ""Rosie O'Donnell."" That was one of my best answers. Rosie O'Donnell who violated the campaign finance laws as badly as anybody I've ever seen and nothing happens to her. Right? And yet ‘jevich violate … He made a little mistake and they want to destroy him. So we pardoned him. We pardoned him. By the way, he made a mistake. Rosie O'Donnell. That was a massive violation of the campaign finance laws but Dinesh, Dinesh, they wanted to put him in jail. I don't know. I think he might've even gone to jail for a period of time for doing something that was really very understandable. Rosie O'Donnell. Five times what she did is incredible. Nothing happens. And then she gets on and says, what a bad guy I am. I'm not a bad guy, but it's really a disgrace. You know, it's a disgrace. I'm glad they didn't do anything with it, frankly because you know what to do for something like that. But you know what? We have two sets of justices in this country. It's no good. It's no good. It's no good. You know the thing we're working on right now? We're trying to get fairness for a certain person who's been treated very unfairly. A man who had a juror, who was a radical anti-Trump person, and she didn't say that when she went up there and she became the foreperson of the jury and she did terrible things and said terrible things. And you know how they caught her. When he was convicted and then a statement was made, she started jumping up and down screaming, "" Yes, yes."" And started telling everybody. They said, ""Wait a minute. Wasn't she just a juror?"" The woman was totally biased. How do you do this? So I fight. Look, I fight. A lot of times it's not worth it, but I got to fight for fairness. I got to fight for fairness. Got to fight for fairness. It's a very unfair system. I guess it's called the swamp. When I said drain the swamp, it was a nice phrase. I never liked the phrase. When I was campaigning, somehow the phrase came up, ""Sir, I think we have a phrase, drain the swamp."" I said, ""I don't like it. That's too hokey."" But one day I was in a big arena, 25,000 people packed before the election and I said, ""And we will drain the swamp."" The place went crazy. I said, ""Wow, you never know. You never know."" Frank Sinatra said his best song. I won't tell you which one because I'll ruin it for you, but his best song is the song that he thought would never make it, the song that he liked the least, but he said that's the one that was the most successful that the people like you never know. So I said, ""Drain the swamp."" And the people went crazy. I said, ""Woah."" I said, ""Let's try that again."" And the next time I did it again and again and again. I only didn't know how disgusting and dirty the swamp is and a lot of the media is a big part of the swamp. So my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. We're defending your right to keep your doctor and your plan. We're defending that right. You're going to have that right back. We're going to cancel that Obamacare if we could win the case and we're going to give you great healthcare and we're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office. We're managing it very well. We got rid of the individual mandate, by far the most unpopular thing where you had to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay for bad healthcare, right? We got rid of it. And it was upheld in the Supreme Court, what we did. Whenever we get sued, everything we do, if we move, if we take 10 steps right or left, we get sued and we're now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive. We're going to make healthcare a big part of this campaign. We're protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will. That's why if we are successful, you don't want the Supreme Court to try and get rid of this, the caucus. It's a caucus known as Obamacare, but we're running it much better than they did. Remember when they had, this was the greatest, the $5 billion website, right? 5 billion. It was supposed to cost 5 million. I have a son at home. He's 13. He's a genius with computers. ""Hi, dad. What's up? Dead dad. Get out of here."" Hey listen. I'm the president of the United States, pal. Don't talk to your dad. ""Dad, Come on dad. Can't you see I'm playing with my computer?"" The guy talks to me and he's working with his computer. These guys are genius. You know, they grow up with like walking, right? But he's looking at me. I could have given him their healthcare site. He would have done it for nothing and it would have been better than what they have. So remember, come on, dad. I'm busy, dad. What do you want? What do you want, dad? Barron, woah. Wow, he's going to like that. He's a good boy. He's a tall boy. I'll tell you that. Just turned 13. He's up there. I'm saying, ""Hi Barron. How are you doing?"" But they're great with the computers. They spent 5 billion. Okay. It was going to cost 50. It was going to cost five. It was going to cost 50. Then it was going to .. What was the final number? Five hundreds. The number that they spent, $5 billion. Right? It still doesn't work. They spent $5 billion. Right? And they spent $500 million on all of the problems it caused and we've really straightened it out, but it's still lousy healthcare, Obamacare. And it's really not Obamacare anymore because when you get rid of the individual mandate, it's no longer Obamacare but we're going to terminate it. We're going to give you your preexisting a hundred per- otherwise I won't do it. We're going to give you brand new preexisting and we're going to have a great healthcare that's much less expensive. And we're fighting to stop surprise medical bill and Barron's is going to be very happy. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast. You know, a man that does this very professionally is great, into the healthcare business and you have to be careful when you say it, but you know it was just a very strong statement. But he said, ""Sir, price transparency in hospitals. Where you can bid it out and you can look at the prices. Right now you can't see. If you go to a hospital, they won't even tell you how much it's going to cost. They operate and then they'll give you a bill and you'll say, ""Oh my god, I had no idea it could be."" They take blood. We have one person, blood $39. Another place, the exact same thing, $2500. Take blood, a blood test. One is $39 one, is $2500. The same test. Maybe the $39 test is better. Who the hell knows? But it's crazy. Price transparency and he looks at me. He goes, and he's a real pro. One of the top in the country. He said, ""Sir,"" and nobody wanted to do it because it's a little bit controversial and a lot of the drug companies don't exactly love it. The hospitals don't love it, but I got to do what's right for you. The people, I don't care, I'm not. I got to do it. But he looked at me. And this is why I did it. It was one phrase. You know, do you ever do where you're not going to do something? And then somebody hits you with a perfect phrase. He said, ""Sir, price transparency is bigger than healthcare."" I said, ""What do you mean by that?"" He said, ""You will see numbers that far outweigh healthcare, hospitals, doctors."" He said, ""You'll be able to price out everything. You'll be able to see costs."" He said, ""Price transparency."" You know, people you've heard about this for 15, 20 years. No president has the guts to do it. Probably means I won't get campaign contributions from certain people, but I'm not going to get them anyway. What the hell difference does that make? I don't want them. I don't want them. I got to do what's right. You know, we're here for a short period of time. Even if it's a long period, it's still a short period and we've got to do so. Price transparency is a big deal. He said it's bigger than healthcare. Think of that. Bigger than healthcare. So let's see what happens. But that'll kick in. Unfortunately, that kicks in after the election because we're going through the final stages. We going through a statutory process, unfortunately. So think of it, we're going to win. But let's say the fake news could give me enough phony stories, enough bad stuff that we don't make it. The new president will get all the credit for price transparency and he won't even know what the hell it is. And I took the heat. Isn't that something? But we're going to win. We got to win for that reason alone. We've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but a fraction of the cost. And that was another one. Tremendous political pressure. Think of it. You own Bayer aspirin. You own all these name name brand drugs that are making so much money. And then the guy comes along said, ""I want to make 20 forms of aspirin."" They're exactly the same. Exactly. But they don't have a big name on it. Exactly as good. I don't say better. I don't say worse. They're exactly the same. You know, people still, they want to go out and buy the name. You know? I do. I do. You know? Because it's just because we're stupid. No, it's true. They're exactly the same. We're approving so many of the generic drugs, a record number. Nobody's ever approved so much. The drug companies hate it. They hate it. Never happened like what we're doing. We also took down the trial periods from 12 years down to five or six years. They'd have a new drug. The thing was obsolete by the time it got approved. We've passed a really spectacular thing that they've been trying to get for 40 some odd years. Right to try. So you don't have to now go if you get, hopefully nobody in this room has those kind of problems. Right to try. And so now you go and you sign a waiver and you get everything. It's great. If you're terminally ill. If you're very, very sick, you're not going to make it. And you know why they didn't do it? They wouldn't approve it because they didn't want to be sued. And they said, ""No, this could be dangerous."" They said, ""The people are terminally ill, they're going to die. Let them use the experimental drugs. Don't wait because they have another four or five years before they can come onto the market."" And it turned out we are having such unbelievable results. And you know what else? Some of those drug companies are now like it. That they fought me like crazy because it's really showing if it works there, it's really showing that it works. It's pretty amazing. Right to try and this is really something, brand new initiatives combating kidney disease and combating Alzheimer's disease. We've made a lot of progress. We've made a lot of progress, Sheldon and we're pursuing new advances in the neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients, our babies, and breaking all records in so doing. All of the radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth. This is why in my state of the union address, did you like it? Good. It's a different kind of address. You know, we can go lots of different ways, right? Presidential, not presidential. I was presidential. Totally. You'd have about three people standing here, but I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your very, very important second amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln, which everybody forgot. Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every single walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. We are wealthy, right? Are we enthusiastic? You know how many of these I've done in the last four days? People say, ""Where the hell do you get your energy?"" I say, ""Well, the truth is I like what I do and if we weren't getting the results, I wouldn't like it."" If we weren't getting the results. If I didn't see the results, I wouldn't like it at all. We're welcoming Americans of all parties and political persuasions to join our incredible movement to make America great again. We're a very big party. We are the party of big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Was never going to happen. We got it done. This could not have been done by anyone but the Republican party and ourselves. You know the Democrats have tried for years. They couldn't get it done. We got it done. To uphold the rule of law. We are confirmed and this is something they say. Most important thing you can do, judges. I say most important thing is defense. Second is judges. A record number of 217 federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written. And we have appointed two great new Supreme court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. We have invested $2.2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, including more than $130 million for Nellis air force base right here. And we just created the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force, 72 years, 72 years. The air force was 72 years ago. We just did a branch. It's a big deal, isn't it? Think of it. A branch, the army, the air force. Think of it. We did a branch. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Nevada. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020 November 3rd. November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that very beautiful phrase, ""Made in the USA."" We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic within nine years in America. And we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant its flag on Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And that is under siege in case you haven't noticed. You know, your second amendment is under siege. Just don't worry. Long as I'm here, they're not touching it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for this. So true. But we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and they are heroes. We love them, of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust. From Carson city to Reno to right here in Las Vegas, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our great, beautiful, lovely freedom, freedom, freedom. Freedom. Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys who tamed the frontier, raised the mighty Hoover dam. That's a beauty. Transformed the barren desert into a shining oasis, lit up the lights of the Las Vegas strip and help to make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Nevada, the best is yet to come together. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, Nevada. Thank you, Las Vegas. We love Las Vegas. Thank you everybody. Thank you."
Trump,"So thank you Pennsylvania, very much. I'm thrilled to be in Latrobe, the home of the late, great, my friend, Arnold Palmer. What a great guy he was. What a great guy. Thank you very much. 61 days from now, we're going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and we are going to win four more years in the White House. Joe Biden wants to surrender your jobs to China. You know that. His son walked out with a lot of money for doing nothing. He wants to surrender your nation to the radical left wing mob. He's trying to change now. We say that's not working because we're going up and he's dropping like a rock in water. And before the China virus, this election was over. Now I had to go back to work and we've done a great job on it. We don't get the credit. We don't get the credit. We made a lot of governors look very good. But I will keep your jobs in America, and I'll bring rioters, looters, violent extremists, anarchists, we will bring them to justice. That's what we're doing right now. We have over 400 right now under arrest. These are bad people. Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, rebuilt the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, secured American energy independence, and built the single greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we're going to do it again. Have to do it again. Have to do it again. Got to do it again. And it's happening. You see what's happening. Job numbers, retail sale numbers, they're all at records. It's happening. It's happening very fast. It's actually happening in a super V, not a V. It's a super V and you'll see that, and big numbers are coming out and have come out, and just watch your set or watch your newspaper. Read your newspaper. You're seeing numbers that, congressmen, we haven't seen those numbers ever before, actually. We've never seen them. And by the way, we have record stock markets. We have record everything. You're going to have an incredible economic year next year. Your stocks are going up. Your 401s are through the roof. I had a little pause today. People wanted to take some profits and probably somebody said something stupid along the way. But the stock market's at record levels. Think of it. In the hopefully rounding the turn on the pandemic, we're rounding that turn, and vaccines are coming along great. The job that they've done, the doctors, everybody else, we're years ahead of schedule. Anybody else's President, you wouldn't be talking about vaccines for two or three years from now. I'll tell you right now. That I can tell you. Biden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family. He is a puppet of the socialists, Marxists, and the cop hating extremists. And they are cop hating. And we love our law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. And by the way, I don't know if you saw this, if there's any way of you seeing it, we have thousands of people behind this hangar, thousands, and we're trying to get them in. And I'd love to get them in. I mean, it's an airport. Let them go to the runways. Okay? Let them in. I mean, literally there, we landed. I actually thought that was the crowd. We're doing the hanger thing now because the arenas can't do it because of the pandemic for a while, a little while. But in certain ways, I like this better. I don't have to travel. I get off the plane. I make a speech. I get the hell out of here. No, these are great. Do you remember the last days before the campaign? I'd do a lot of them a day. Get off that plane. It was a little different plane. It was black and white instead of the blue and white. But we had some time. And that was an important day and that was an important year, 2016. But I will tell you, the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country. And we had a level of enthusiasm, I mean, even look today. With all going on, look at the kind of crowds we have. But we had record enthusiasm in 2016. By the way, was that greatest evening ever? November. And now it's going to be November 3rd, and we'll keep it going and we'll get it all like a tree. You move that tree. It takes a little while to plant, your tax cuts. They're going to raise your taxes. They're going to take away your guns. Really, if you look. And you know, they'll criticize me for saying this, the fake news media, which is back there, with their fake polls. The same as last year. We could just put it all on tape. The fake polls, the fake everything. You know, they're called suppression polls. They're meant to make you depressed. Are you depressed? You don't look depressed. We have the real numbers. We're leading everywhere. We are leading everywhere. I'll tell you. I think we're way ahead of what we were four years ago, and there's far more enthusiasm. Our base is bigger. It's stronger. And we've done the greatest job. Again, if we didn't get hit by the plague from China, between us, I would have canceled, Mr. Congressman, most of the rallies. I wouldn't have needed a rally. That's a little bit unfair, but that's okay. That's what China's done to our nation. They've screwed us for a long time on a lot of different ways. Never has anybody ripped off our nation like China, and I've taken in billions and billions of dollars. We never took in 25 cents from China. And I gave $28 billion, right, $28 billion to the farmers because they were targeted unfairly by China. And our farmers are very unhappy. I don't think we have too many farmers in this wonderful Pennsylvania town. I know we have a lot of boilermakers over there. We got a lot of boilermakers, I'll be talking about them. Look at those guys. Nobody going to mess with them. I'll tell you. We're going to be talking about them in a minute. But for the entire summer, Biden was silent as far left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement in Democrat run cities all, burned down businesses, terrorized civilians, and just recently marched through the streets chanting, ""Death to America."" This is what we have. Death to America. And by the way, we could end it like immediately. You saw what we did in Wisconsin. It ended. It took a while for the governor. You know, they have to ask us in. It's like, otherwise we have to do something much bigger and it's totally unnecessary. The National Guard is fantastic. I went to see them two days ago. Biden went there today. There was nobody there. There was nobody there. He was a little late. I was going to say, ""Hey, listen, we ended that problem."" But we could end it in Portland. Wise guys in Portland. Anarchists. They're agitators. They're looters. I'll tell you we could end it in Portland in a half an hour. We did it in Seattle. We told them we're coming in. You either end it or were coming in. Congressman, we were going in the next day. We were all set. I was actually disappointed, to be honest. They ended it in Seattle. They took over 20% of the city. Do you believe this? And the mayor said, ""No, it's going to be a summer of love."" These people are crazy. So we end them very quickly. We end them very quickly. And now what we're doing is we're holding back funds for cities that don't know what they're doing, where they allow crime to run rampant. And we put a 10 year prison sentence at anybody that knocks down a statue. I took out an old ordinance, a very old one, because today in Congress, you don't get things like that today. They think that you should just have no cash bail. They do the no cash bail. You kill somebody. There's no bail. Don't worry about it. Go out. But I took out an old ordinance. I gave a new executive order. It says 10 years in prison. And amazingly, amazingly, that was three and a half months ago. And they were having a big march on Washington, march elsewhere, and amazingly, that was the end of the statues coming down. No statutes. And we're actually prosecuting people for having done it. We made it retroactive to the beginning. Terrible. Terrible. And by the way, the state statues and monuments, they have to do the same thing. It's real easy. But the rioters that want Biden to win, they want him to win because their agenda, it's what they want. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. They both want to cut funding for police. They want to end that cash bail. They want to hire far left prosecutors and judges, and let the criminals run wild. The radical left District Attorney in Portland, Mike Schmidt, his name is, has released hundreds of rioters that announced that anyone arrested for interfering with police officers, disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, rioting, and other offenses will not be prosecuted under any circumstance. Oh, it's worse. It's worse. You have somebody in Philadelphia who's worse, right? Worse. In his manifesto with Bernie Sanders, that's what it is, Biden agreed to all these things. You notice now, ""No, no. I never said about fracking. I never said."" If you don't do fracking in Pennsylvania, 900,000 jobs and your energy bills will triple. Other than that, I don't think you should have it. Okay? No, but he said in the manifesto, plus he said many times, we put on the clip yesterday where he, no fracking, no this, no that, I mean, no guns. How about guns? No guns. No second amendment. Biden has pledged to a point prosecutors who extend these insane far left policies nationwide. That's what he's done. That's called the manifesto. He agreed to all this stuff. The craziest thing, you're supposed to bring it to the right. He actually brought it further left. Bernie never dreamt that this was possible, crazy Bernie. Do you know crazy Bernie? I had a lot of his voters come to me four years ago, a big percentage. You know why? Because I agree with him and he agrees with me on one thing, trade. The trade. Because he knew that other countries are ripping us off and so did I. Nobody else got it. Especially Biden never got it. He never got it. Still doesn't get it. Now he really gets nothing. I tell you. He didn't get it in prime time. Now he really doesn't get it. But it's okay for them to make every city look just like Portland which is a disaster. And again, we could clean it up. We just go right through it. 5,000, 10,000, right through it. These guys are tough. They're smart. And they love our country. They love our country. We'll clean it up in one half hour. It'll be over.  strength. They don't understand. Nice. They chased him out of his home. Unbelievable. Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorist. And my plan is to arrest them and prosecute them. And I will always defend law abiding citizens. That's why the rioters are voting for Biden and the law enforcement people, you know, we have it from everybody. We just got the sheriffs in Florida, all of them, all of them. We got Ohio. We got Texas. We got North Carolina. We got South Carolina. We got everybody. I see Rick Perry right there. Rick Perry, what are you doing here, Rick? Rick Perry, one of the greats. But they're all voting for me. This election is about safety and this election is about jobs. Today, I'm delighted to accept a very, very special endorsement from people I like. Sort of grew up with these people. I don't know what it is, the relationship we have with all of us, with all of us. What I'm endorsing, I'm getting an endorsement tonight from some very, very special people. They work hard. They do great. We really put them back to work because this state was in trouble. At last year, you had the single greatest economic year in the history of your whole operation, right? Of your whole operation. You've never had anything like that. This has been your greatest. This has been prior to the plague coming in. It's been the Commonwealth's greatest. Can we ever call the Commonwealth a state? You have two places. But you always have to say, well, wait a minute. Is this one a Commonwealth? Two places. You know what the other place is? Name it. Huh? That's right. How did you know that, Congressmen? Huh? But this Commonwealth, it's a great Commonwealth. It's a great place. And the boilermakers, local union, it's Local 154 of the boilermakers. They chartered in Pittsburgh 125 years ago. None of you were around to see it, and it now represents members in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. And I want to thank John Hughes and the boilermakers here today. It's a great honor to have you. Where's John? Where the hell is John? Stand up, John. John, we appreciate it. We appreciate it. Do you know why John is the head? You know why? Because look, he's got the worst location. I say, ""Where's John?"" I'm looking in the front row. Put up your hand, John. Look at that guy. He's great. You've got my vote, John. Hey, boilermakers, thank you. What a job you do. You're the heart of this country. You really are. Thank you very much. That's a great endorsement. That's a great endorsement. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping Pennsylvania jobs to China and foreign nations. And I've spent the last four years bringing them back home and we're bringing them back home. Bringing a lot of things back home. I ended the last administration's eight year pure war on Pennsylvania oil, and coal, and fracking. If you look at the natural gas, what they've done to this state, what they were doing to this state. It was sort of easy. I just opened it up and I said, ""Do it."" And the investment put into Pennsylvania, the investment put into the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has been record setting. But again, you had the greatest year you've ever had last year prior to the virus. You're going to be set. Now with what we're doing, I believe that this next quarter, which will be announced, interestingly, just prior to the election, so I'm putting myself on the line, but I know what's going to happen. The numbers are going to be great. And next year is going to be one of the greatest years not only for Pennsylvania, but for the entire country. So Joe Hiden, we have a new one, Joe Hiden. We call him Joe Hiden. I have all. What do you like better? What do you like better? We got a number. Let's do a little poll. Can we do a poll? I saved myself so much money. You know, I saved myself so much money. We do these polls with thousands, and those people are coming in from the back, are they not? Yes? They're coming in. I'm telling you wouldn't have believed it. I'm landing. I wasn't waving at you. I was waving at them. There's more. But I do these polls. Right? And it's like a perfect poll. Do you ever see the companies? You give them a million bucks and they do a poll, like 78 people were polled. Now you've got thousands of people. So tell me. What's your feeling, first of all in the name You like MAGA, Make America Great Again? Yes? Oh, you are the one. You are a man. I made you famous today. You said the nicest things about me. Thank you. Did you see him on television today? I think you're great. I think you're great. Thank you. No, he called me a great Christian and a great Christian leader. Thank you. But he did say I wasn't perfect, but that's okay. I said thank you, anyway. Right? No, that was really great. That was really great. Biden- No that was really great. That was really great. But if you look at it, the things they've done, we're going to go through a couple of different polls as we go along because I love the people saying do this or do that. But one of the things I got you out of is this thing sounds so good but it's so bad. It's a rip off of our country. The so-called Paris Climate Accord. It's a disaster, a death sentence. It's a death sentence for your energy jobs. I took it out. I withdrew from that calamity. Biden pledged to reinstate it. It's going to cost you billions and billions of dollars. You know what it really is? It's a way of really taking advantage of the United States. This is what it is. Last year I visited the Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County. Anybody ever hear of Beaver County? The largest investment in your state's history, all made possible by our pro-energy policies. Biden would wipe out that entire industry killing the jobs of more than 600,000 Pennsylvania workers. It's probably 940,000 they say. Think of that. Also, prices and everything else. Now Biden today came out and said, ""No, no, fracking's okay, it's okay? Did you see that? Fracking's okay. Because he was getting killed. And now we came out in favor of law enforcement. Look at all these handsome cops here. And a beautiful cop. If you would see how beautiful, if you would see how beautiful this is, it was like this perfect evening, the sun was setting, the faces of these great, great majestic heroes of our country, right? Heroes of our country. And they want to blow Mount Rushmore. But how about this one? The Democrats yesterday came out with a plan. Did you see it? Now, they're the DC Democrats. They want to change the name of the Washington Monument, perhaps take it down. Thomas Jefferson, pretty good Thomas Jefferson, right? You could forget about ever hearing that name again. Abraham Lincoln, you could forget about it. They want to take down all statues, all monuments in Washington. We have some of your greatest people right here. Let me not even talk to the congressmen. The heck with the Congressman, the boiler makers. How do you like? How do you like the idea of taking down our statues to our great George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, all of them? I don't think the boiler makers. You'll do a ring around Washington right? Along with Christopher Columbus. He's in big trouble I'll tell you. Except there was one, there was a group of great Italians in New York, they tried to take down. They tried to take down Christopher Columbus statue in New York. You saw what happened, right? These Italians formed a little circle. They said, ""Come on."" The agitators decided to leave. ""Let's get out of here darling."" They protected Christopher Columbus. The Italians, now the Italians aren't big on taking down Christopher Columbus. You take down those statues you can forget about the Italian vote. Do we agree? But they protected it. When asked at the debate if there would be any place for fossil fuels, including coal, and fracking, and natural gas, and so many things that really fire up these big plants where many of you work, and they produce just millions and millions of jobs throughout our country, Biden said, ""No, we would absolutely not allow anything like that. We would make sure it's totally eliminated."" That's what he said. He said, ""We would make sure it's totally eliminated or eliminated."" Now he's coming and saying, ""This isn't working too well. This isn't working."" And I made a speech a week ago in Texas. We had crowds that were unbelievable, on the highways, you can't get in, but the highways, it's like incredible. You could sell your ticket tonight for a lot of money, go to eBay. Even as a used ticket, you could probably sell. But you go down the highways and you see it, and I was thinking of Texas, I'm making a speech in front of obviously people that like oil, they like God, and you know what else they like, they like their Second Amendment, right? So think about it. So whether it's Pennsylvania, or Texas, or Oklahoma, or North Dakota, or any place, you take a look at this, right? And no oil, no guns, no God. I don't think George Washington running with Abraham Lincoln as his VP, he'll pick Abraham Lincoln as VP is going to win in Texas, or in Pennsylvania, or any place else with those three things eliminated. That's what they want to do. They want to take away your Second Amendment. If I weren't president, you would either have an obliterated Second Amendment or it would be gone entirely. I am standing between them and your Second Amendment. And that's it. That's it. They know. We put Baido in charge of guns. Baido is in charge, he wants to get rid of everything. Baido, that's a beauty. Remember he said, ""I was born for this."" Anybody that says they're born for this. Remember Baido? He was on the cover of a magazine, I won't mention the magazine, they're back there. It's a total phony magazine. But he was on the cover of the magazine. And he said, ""I was born to run for president."" He was born for it. I was born. Anybody that gets that character. That was when he was doing well. Since then he's cratered. Ever since he made that statement, he's looked very bad. But take a look at what he says about guns, and he got put in charge of guns. So I guess Biden pretty soon he's going to be coming out saying, ""No, no. I never said that."" Check out all of the statements he's made on everything and now he's going the opposite way, but he's agreed to the manifesto entirely so maybe he'll do that. And then he figures later on, he'll go. But everything he said is right, because he has no control over what's happening. The radical left has captured the party. They even elected a person that nobody ever heard of, a senator, it's been a while, against a young, good looking Kennedy by 10 points in Massachusetts. Did you know Kennedy lost in Massachusetts? You know why? Because he wasn't a radical left. He was like a semi-normal person, just slightly left. No, but think of it. This is what's happened. And this is really what's happened. If you're not a radical lefty, meaning guns, meaning fossil fuels, they want wind, wind. To make the windmill, which are made mostly in China, and in Germany, by the way, to make it, so much emission is let out, that is more than you can ever save. It's just the craziest thing. Also, I am truly an environmentalist, but you have to understand. When we do things and they don't, and we clean, and it's very expensive to do that and they don't, and we have this massive planet, and China, India, Russia, Germany, all these places, it's fuming up and we're doing our job and beautiful. No, they have to do it also. Otherwise, it just doesn't work the way it's supposed to. They want to ban straws. Has anybody ever tried those paper straws? They are not working too good. Right? They want to ban straws, I said, well, I've had a couple of meals at McDonald's, et cetera over the years, right? Wendy's, a friend of mine owns Wendy's, I'll give it a plug, right? Burger King. So they want to ban straws. I said, ""Oh really? What about the carton? What about the plate? What about the knives and the spoons that are plastic?"" Oh, they're okay, but the straws we got ban. Has anybody ever tried, seriously, the new straw, it's made out of paper, right? It disintegrates as you drink and if you have a nice tie like this tie, this would have no chance. By the time you get finished, the straw is totally disintegrated. Does anybody walk around with a plastic straw? Because it's that bad. You whip it out, boom, boom. You never had to do that. When asked whether he would be willing to destroy the jobs of hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers to push his anti-energy agenda, you know what the answer is, right? It's the Green New Deal, right? This Green New Deal. This was made up by people that don't get it. Either that or people that just don't like our country very much. But Biden replied yes, he'll get rid of those jobs. And he famously told a voter, ""I want you to look in my eyes,"" when he's not wearing the mask because I've never seen a man that liked their mask. Look, I'm all for it, we have a big weekend, distance on the weekend, and all of that stuff, and wear your mask when you're close together in particular, and wash your hands, all those things. We have Labor Day Weekend coming up. But did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him? And then he makes a speech and he always has it, not always, but a lot of times he has it hanging down. Because you know what? It gives him a feeling of security. If I were a psychiatrist, right? I'd say, ""This guy's got some big issues."" Hanging down. Hanging down. Congressman, give me your mask. I want to have it hanging from my ear. I don't want to touch your damn mask. Mike I'll never touch your mask. No, but the new one is, I went for a physical, the doctor said to me, ""Sir would you like to go over to Walter Reed? It's incredible."" By the way, the job they do on people that have been just really hurt, our heroes. The job they do is incredible. ""Sir would you like to go over and do a physical? You have some time."" You know why I had time? Some deal, oh, it was China. I decided not to see China because I didn't like the way they were doing business, okay? Does that make sense? So the doctor, White House doctor, highly respected, Sean, Sean Conley, ""Sir would you like to go over and do your physical, or do a piece of it, or finish it?"" or whatever it was, but do a physic. I said, ""I don't know. I'm not in love with the idea."" ""Well, if you do it, you don't have to do…"" ""Okay. Let's go. Come on."" So we went, we went, and we're driving. Now you have to understand, they're like a hundred cars. You see what happens here. It's like the plane times 50. So the cars are driving all over to about a 20 minute drive and we get to the hospital, I get out. I was there probably for an hour and a half, two hours. And then yesterday I read that I had strokes. CNN, fake news CNN right there. No, it's true. Mini strokes they called them. I don't know what a mini stroke is, but it's not good. And there could be a day and I'll admit, I said ""Hey, it happens all of us."" Right? Except these young ones. It's never going to happen to them. And I'd look at it at that, but you know what happens? But nothing happened. So I went in, I did that part of the physical. The end result was he's very healthy. They were very unhappy when they heard that result. What you don't remember is when this took place, it was a long time ago. They just started up because they want to try and get me to be in Biden's physical level. They view me as being somebody that's, I go around, hey, last week, this week, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, South Carolina, back to Washington. Let's go here, let's go there, let's go everywhere. Meetings all the time. I think I've answered more questions from these maniacs than any president in history. And mean questions. I watched Biden yesterday, so he hasn't answered questions in what, two months or something. And yesterday he took a couple and they were set ups like I've never seen. One young woman who I think is there, one young woman is smiling, ""Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi. I just like to ask you, I'm sorry to bother you with this question."" It's the most incredible. So the doctor wrote a letter saying, ""No, this rumor is wrong."" And I don't like, rumors like that. And by the way, if it were a fact, it's fine, it should. I think it's an important thing. But if it's not true, my wife was like, she came to me, she said, ""I think I would have known that."" I said, ""Yeah, I think they would have known it too, because they drove back with me."" The press follows me, they have a special deal, and then they followed me and then we go in, we go out. But if you remember, last time, I go in, I spend a little time, a physical like we all have. Hopefully you have them. Good thing to have I guess, as long as they give you a good answer. If they give you a bad answer don't bother, possibly too late. But I go in, I come out a couple of hours later I guess, whatever it is, it's a short time later, I get into the car, the press sees me get into the car. On my way home, I get a call from my wife, the First Lady who's very popular. Do we like our First Lady? Very popular, great person, great woman. She said, ""Darling, are you okay?"" I go, ""Why do you ask?"" She said, ""They're reporting that you had a heart attack."" Now you have to understand I'm driving in a car, which is about what? Six cars in front of the press, because they have a big car. They're a lot of them and we try and give them as little room as possible, make it uncomfortable. But they're right behind me. So they know I got in and CNN reported that I had a heart attack. That was the same visit, and that didn't work. No it's unbelievable. CNN reported I had a heart attack so my wife was concerned. I said, ""No, not that I know of. And if I did, I think I'd be back there. No. I'll be home in 15 minutes, darling. Thank you for caring."" It's always nice. It's always nice. She sounded relieved. That's good. When your wife sounds relieved. But she said, "" I wonder how that happened. Why did they do that?"" Because they're fake news. So I go in and that rumor lasted for a little while, like a day or two. It lasted for a little while, no matter what I did. I'm in the same motorcade, I go in, and I go out. They know I'm in the motorcade, I actually have to report it, but I'm in the motorcade, and they said I had a… One of them said it was a massive heart attack. Think of it. Again, it could happen someday, okay? And when it does, I hope things work out. But they knew I'm in the motorcade and yet they reported it anyway because they fake news. Now for the same visit, that was the stupidest thing. From now on, when I go for a physical or something or go to the hospital, announce it because this was a quick thing. The doctor, he got me in a lot of trouble. He's a great doctor. I said, ""No more surprise visits to the hospital where we do a little work because we have some time."" So now the same visit they started yesterday because some joker from the New York Times who's a third grade reporter writes a book and he said, ""The vice president was prepared to take over the reins because they thought the president was going to go,"" I guess, under anesthesia. Do they still call it…? In the old days they called it anesthesia. It's essentially the same thing. I don't want to get into a situation like where Biden used a record player. Remember that? You go home, you turn on your record player. But the anesthesia. And I said, ""How could that be?"" So remember, this is the same visit, same visit. They said heart attack a long time. All of a sudden out of this book. And he said, ""Suffered mini strokes."" Now they get a letter from the White House doctor that said it's totally false, totally false. But they still go with it, they go with it. And they know I'm in the group with them coming back. And I don't know much about a mini stroke, but I assume Mr. Congressman, if you have a mini stroke, you're not heading back to the White House, right? At least you'll spend a couple of nights at that great hospital, right? So anyway, these are really dangerous people. They are so bad for our country. If we had honest press, it would be so great for the USA. It would be so great. They're just a bunch of phony people. Not all of them. You have some very good ones, like about 10%. No, you have some very good ones, you have some great journalists, they know it's phony stuff. They're doing anything they can to get this sleepy guy into the White House and I just don't think the public is going to fall for it. I don't think the public is going to fall for it. In his best days, 25, 30 years ago, he was weak. He was weak. As a Senator, he was weak. He was not known as being one of the smart ones and now it's not exactly primetime, I can tell you that. I just want to announce tonight because we're joined with some very, very special warriors and Dan Meuser, Dan, thank you very much. Great job you're doing. Dan, Congressman. He's a Congressman who have really been warriors for me. You really have been. Thank you very much Dan. Fred Keller, Fred, thank you. Great job, Fred. The great John Joyce. Great, thank you, John. Guy Reschenthaler. Do you know him? Guy Reschenthaler. what are you doing over there? What happened? You don't get along with these guys? Oh, okay. That's good. Now I understand. That's good. Glenn Thompson. Great job, great job Glenn, really great. And a real good friend of mine, right from the beginning, right, Mike? We were in Pennsylvania and a friend of ours, a Congressman, longterm, right? From Kentucky. No, from actually Tennessee came up to us, I was getting ready to make a speech, and Tennessee is very early voting. Remember what he said? This was four years ago. He said, ""I don't know what's happening in Pennsylvania. I don't know what's happening in the rest of the country. But if what's going on in the rest of the country is like what's going on in Tennessee?"" He said, ""They're coming from the Hills, the roadsides, the rivers."" He said they're coming, people that never really cared to vote, they're great Americans, but they never wanted to vote for the people that they were seeing. He said, ""They're miles long. They've got Trump here, Trump hats, Trump pins,"" right? Tennessee. Duncan, Congressman Duncan, right? Remember that Mike? That was the first time. I mean, they said that they'd never seen anything like it. Tennessee has been incredible by the way. So Mike and I listened and we said, ""I wonder what that's all about."" But it is true. People that weren't really political people, they're coming in, and the deal here, like the Miss Universe, good old Miss Universe, right? Like this, they came with hats, they came with pins, they're loaded with pins. One person had hundreds of pins. They never would've had a pin in their life, but they love the job that we've done and we're going to do it even better in the next four years. Another great friend of mine who's a tough cookie and a great Congressman. But unfortunately he's a former because he's just, I don't know., He's just a special guy and really has a big, beautiful heart, Lou Barletta, Lou. You look good Lou. Why don't you run again Lou? And a man who is tough. There's this guy. You ever hear of a guy named Conor Lamb? He's like a lamb. So we heard, because he's in sort of a Trumpy area, right? And we heard that he's going to be for Trump, but he's going to be fighting for Trump. I saw some of his commercials, I thought he was a Republican, right? Except when he got to Washington, he voted with Pelosi a hundred percent of the time. Craziness. He voted with craziness. And so we thought, this Conor lamb guy, he even voted to impeach your president over nothing. Zero. Zero. And that's very personal. When they do that, that's personal. And I have to say congressmen, 196 to nothing they stuck with us and so did the Senate other than Romney. You can have Romney I think. Remember he was walking with the Black Lives Matter saying, ""Yes, I'm a member of Black Lives Matter."" Everyone said, ""That's nice. Wonderful."" He had a lot of mask on, I'll tell you that. But we did a great job, it was an amazing thing. But this Conor Lamb was out there fighting it, and he shouldn't have done that. And we have somebody that blows him away. He's more of a hero, he's tougher, he's stronger, he's smarter, he's better looking, not that, that matters. Under the me too generation, I don't talk about looks anymore. Looks don't matter. Doesn't make any difference. I don't talk about looks. Me too. Me too generation. But I'll tell you, this man is something special. He's a real hero, a real tough guy, and he'll never let you down, Sean Parnell. Just remember that Conor lamb, and I remember, because he's like a lamb, he's like a little lamb. Weak, got a lot of weak people. We like strong people, don't we? We like strong people. We need strong people right now. We have somebody else in the audience who served as my Secretary of Energy and he was incredible. He was the Governor of Texas for what? 12 years I think. Rick right? 12? Tell me. 14? 14 years he was. And he was an incredible governor, and he was an incredible secretary, and he's been an incredible friend. Rick Perry everybody. There was nobody that got into the race tougher than Rick. What he said about me, I'll never repeat again. Even my own family didn't like me when he got finished. And when he decided that I would be the one, he got out and there's nobody that's said better things about me. But you're great Rick, and you did a fantastic job. Every place you've been, you've been great. Thank you very much. Rick Perry. Thank you. Hey Rick, how are we doing in Texas? 00, the polls closed and they only announce if you're way ahead. So they say, ""The polls have closed in the great state of Texas, Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas."" … Hillary even beat this guy. Hillary. Hillary came in second in Utah. This week my administration reached a breakthrough agreement to stop additional steel imports from Brazil and from Mexico for the rest of the year despite the USMCA, sometimes they get a little carried away and we have to do a little tariff action on them. So we stopped that. We're reversing decades of the Biden betrayals that decimated Pennsylvania jobs, you know that. This state lost, listen to this, one in three manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organizations, one of the worst things that happened, when China came in. They were flat-lined for many years, then they came into this crazy deal. They're considered a developing nation, you see I've been sort of protesting that like, but they're considering China as a developing nation, you get all sorts of things that you would never get, advantages over the United States. Well we have very strongly protested that. They're not a developing nation, they're a very powerful developed nation, and you know what? They got to pay what everyone else has to pay. Earlier this year I kept my promise to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement into law which is in effect now and really doing well. Everyone said it will never happen, and I had great help from these gentlemen right here. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging, plundering and rampant theft of Pennsylvania and many other places, jobs. That's all throughout the world by the way but our states have been just pillaged by China and others. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in America. After years and years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, it's called America First. We're America First, that's enough, and we're bringing our soldiers back home. You see what's going on. After 19 years in Afghanistan, far away places, to bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunity zones, Tim Scott, great senator from South Carolina worked on it with me. Passed criminal justice reform, delivered permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities that Obama would never do and before the China virus we achieved the lowest African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American unemployment rates ever recorded by far. And they're now heading back in that direction quickly. Democrat politicians have failed the black community for decades, they've failed the Asian community, the Hispanic community. They failed women. The numbers on women's unemployment were the best in 61 years. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the American people. He was always for things that you wouldn't want and now he's changing, ""No, I never said that. I never said that."" I've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African-American community and for all communities and the best is yet to come. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds and on the subject of immigration, we've been fighting for that. Under my administration we achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members and we get them out and we get them out fast. Thank you ICE. ICE and Border Patrol. ICE and Border Patrol. They don't like ICE because ICE is, they're tough. You got to be tough in that job by the way. Anybody up here like to work in ICE? I don't think so. Let's see, you could probably be okay but you'd rather do what you're doing, right? I agree with you. These are tough guys, they have to be tough. These are bad, bad gang members. I mean you look at MS-13, you look at what's happened with MS-13, you look at … We get them the hell out. Sometimes we have to put them in prison because we don't even want to take a chance, they can come back in after what they've done, we had thieves, we had some very bad people in the VA and they're all gone. Thank you, I love you too, thank you. Thank you. Such friendly voices. Quite beautiful. Only in Pennsylvania, right? Thank you. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal, think of this. Obama paid $150 billion for a short-term deal. He gave $1.8 billion in cash. You ever see a million dollars like at a casino floor or something in $100 bills? It's a lot, it's like the size of this, right? Now think $1.8 billion. How did you guys allow that to happen? They said we all voted against it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel. You never know nowadays, right? And I opened the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They've been trying to get that done for 52 years, I got it done immediately. By the way, as far as the capital of Israel, Jerusalem, they've been talking about many, many presidents. They all promised it, nobody did it. I did it. We get things done, and we just did something that is incredible. Even the New York Times gave it good reviews, not good reviews, beyond good reviews. Tom Friedman gave it phenomenal reviews, you believe that? That's we achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades, a deal with Israel and the UAE. It's a deal with Israel and the UAE and that's going to lead and I'm going to tell you we have representatives over right now and other people are saying we want to get in that deal. You'll have peace in the Middle East. We want to get the hell out. Let's get them all back. Let's get thel all back. Don't forget, we're energy independent. There used to be a reason. Now we do have a reason, it's called Israel, and we have some very good partnerships over there. In all fairness we have some countries that have treated us very well and we're going to take care of those countries, but we are energy independent for the first time and that's a very good feeling. Our military has never been stronger than it is now. It's new and it's beautiful and I told you we took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi, and separately, we killed the world's number one terrorist, number one terrorist for decades and decades, Qasem Soleimani. We killed Soleimani. It's a big step for the Middle East. We kept America out of wars. Remember they always said, ""Oh, this Trump. He's radical, he's really, I mean he's off the … He's too radical. He'll get us in wars."" I kept us out of wars, what happened with North Korea? Look, I get along with Kim Jong-un. They say, ""That's terrible he gets along."" No it's good if I get along. If I get along with Russia, is that a good thing or a bad thing? I think it's a good thing. These guys only fight to tie, they don't fight to win, you fight to win. You look at what's happening where they're all coming back home. I even reduced in Germany because Germany, they're an ally, but you know, they took advantage of us very badly on trade and very badly with our military. So we removed a lot of soldiers out of Germany. They're not happy, they said, ""This is going to hurt our economy."" Well it's good for our economy, okay? They thought it was going to hurt the German economy. Well, they don't treat us right, they don't pay their bills, they're delinquent. You know what delinquent is? They're delinquent. They don't pay their bills. We protect them, they don't pay their bills. We got to do something and they treat us horribly on trade through the European Union which basically they run. Together we've been rapidly fixing a half a century of disasters and Biden was there for every one of them. Joe Biden supported NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade. He supported the Korean deal, the Korean deal was so bad, it was so bad. This was a deal that was going to produce to South Korea done by Crooked Hillary Clinton, this was a deal that was going to produce 250,000 jobs. She said, "" This will be 250,000,"" and she was right, for South Korea. It produced 250,000 jobs. For us, we got nothing. We got losses, we got nothing. It was a terrible deal, I renegotiated, now it's a good deal. They also gave and want to give mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Biden supported cutting Social Security. He voted for the Iraq War, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani, when I did that, he said, ""That's a terrible thing. That's a terrible thing."" Everybody in the Middle East, they couldn't believe it. They celebrated, some of them quite quietly I must add. Sign your mail-in ballot. You sign it and send it in and then you have to follow it and if on Election Day or early voting, that is not tabulated and counted, you go vote, and then if for some reason after that, it shouldn't take that long, it comes in, they're not going to be able to tabulate it because you will have voted. But you have to make sure your vote counts because the only way they're going to beat us is by doing that kind of stuff. I'm trying to be nice. I'm trying to be nice. They want to send out congressmen 80 million ballots. Now there have been many races over the last year where they've done this and they've been a disaster. You look at New York, they had a congressional race, not a very good congresswoman, very untalented, I know her well, I lived in New York. She's not got much going. They have no idea what the vote is, I think 20% of the ballots were missing and then they declared her the winner and the other guy said, ""What about me?"" He's not too happy, her opponent. You look at what happened in Paterson, New Jersey, you look at what happened in Virginia, you look at what happened … There's not a race, and these are small, these are easy to control. they want to send out 80 million unsolicited, I like it much better, they used to say universal, they used to say live ballots, I like the word unsolicited, and solicited. Solicited is okay, because that's when you're asking and you want it and you send in the necessary paperwork and documentation and you get the ballot and you fill it out, that's okay. But you can't, this whole thing with the unsolicited, unsolicited means you're sitting there. We have a big enthusiasm edge, but when they throw these things in your face and the lists are inaccurate and people are dead and dogs have gotten ballots, they have. Dogs have gotten ballots and they know I'm right and everybody knows I'm right and they say I'm right behind the closed doors and it's a disgrace, what they do to our country. 80 million unsolicited ballots. People that had no idea. People that weren't going to vote in all fairness. It's really unfair because our people have enthusiasm, they're going out to vote. They're all going out to vote. Everybody here going to vote? Everybody? They have no enthusiasm. So I said, ""So that's unfair. That guy walks and then they'll have somebody knock on the door, say, ""Listen, I would like your ballot."" ""I don't want to vote. I don't care about Biden. I'm a Democrat. I don't care about this guy."" ""Well look, where is it?"" ""Here take it, blah blah blah."""" They even have a provision where you don't have to verify signatures. What is going on? And they have another provision in some states where you can harvest, that's where you grab them all together and drop them. In Nevada, they actually have a provision where they don't have to be counted until seven days after the election. So that means if we have a close election, could be close, I hope it's not, I hope we have a landslide like you've never seen. But if we have a close election that means Nevada has the right to, and I love Nevada, I think we're going to win Nevada, except where they're sending all these hundreds of thousands, millions of unsolicited ballots to people in Nevada and people that probably left a long time ago. It's very unfair, it's very unfair, but think of it. They have seven days after the election. Did you know that Mike? Seven days, what does that mean? I want to see the results of the election on November 3. By the way, if it's anything like these other events, it could go on forever. I mean the congressional race which they just gave up and they declared her a winner which they should not have done, they should make that a do-over and I think in Paterson they have a do-over. I think they're going to do it over because it was just ripe with fraud, theft. People were selling ballots, people were selling ballots, and you know they talk about Russia. They're so worried about Russia. What about sending out 80 million ballots? That's your real problem, and if Russia or China or these other countries want to cheat, all they have to do is forge ballots. It's much easier than the way they have to go about it, right? So we have to put pressure on these people. Now the good news is we have a lot of court cases we have won in Pennsylvania, you know that, right? We have two judges, we have a state judge, we have a federal judge. I think both highly qualified judges from what I understand, I hear that they're not too happy about what they're seeing. So we'll see what happens. We're going to see what happens. The lawyers feel very confident but we have to win those cases but what you have to do is send in your early ballot and then go and make sure that ballot is tabulated or counted, and if it's not counted, vote, and then they have the job, if it comes in late, and if it's not too late, they have the job of making sure that they don't count it. But follow that ballot because these people, they'll be lost, they'll be gone, the numbers are incredible where they're 25 and 30% off, 20% off. Follow your ballot. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Sleepy Joe hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. You know that. You know he always gets up today, ""COVID-19, COVID-19."" I say, ""Joe, look. We got a country,"" and I agree with that and we've done a hell of a job. We've done a hell of a job. If you look at some of our numbers. You got to start talking about the economy and you got to start talking, your place, I mean this is … When you look at Pennsylvania, you're in a shutdown. You have a governor that has you shut down we know the susceptible are old people, senior citizens, nursing homes. People that are old, especially if they have heart problems or if they have diabetes. We know that, we learned it, and we opened it up. But the problem these shutdowns are causing much bigger problems. You remember my original statement, right? The cure can't be greater. It was an original statement that a lot of people picked up but it's so true. You have to open up this commonwealth, it has to be opened up. It has to be opened up now. But there's what I think they're doing, because you have the same thing in New York. We have a governor in New York who is 36,000 people died, 11,000 people in a nursing home because he made a mistake. He made a horrible mistake, and I built him a convention center with 2,800 beds and they didn't use it and I sent up a ship, a great hospital ship, a massive hospital with hundreds and hundreds of rooms and they didn't use it and he requested it and then I said, ""You're not using it. Why aren't you using it?"" He could have put those people in the convention center in the hospital ship. What a shame how long can you do this for? Restaurant, poor guys. You can't, how long can you do this for? The people are going to lose their jobs. They're never going to open again. It's not like the restaurants is the greatest business in the world. It's a hard business. New York is closed. You're closed. North Carolina's closed. Michigan's … all Democrats. Let me tell you, what's going to happen on November 4th. They're going to announce their opening. They're doing this for political reasons. They are. Right, John? They're doing it for political reasons because they want our numbers to look as bad as possible, going into November 3rd, election day. Then as soon as the election's over with, win, lose or draw for them, they're going to open it. They got nothing. You know what? It's a shame what they're doing. For political reasons, they'll be open. You'll be open on November 4th, but you know what? From your standpoint, it's very close to the election. It's very far if you have a restaurant, and you can't open your restaurant. You can't open your store. It's a disgrace and they ought to get together. They ought to do it. These are Democrat governors in all instances and Democrat mayors. When the China virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Thanks to the life- saving therapies that we pioneered, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since April. Think of that. We've achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country, anywhere in the world. You never hear that from the fake news. They don't want to talk to you about it. This is a big country. This is a tougher country to do that with, the European Union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours. If you look now, Spain is having a big blow up. France is having a big blow up. Now, we've done a great job, we haven't been given credit for it. He always starts off, COVID-19. That's all he knows. COVID-19. I said, ""What about the economy? What about jobs? What about all the other things we have to do?"" All he does, he thinks it's a weak spot, and actually in theory, if we're getting a fair shake from those people back there, it's actually what the job we've done is actually a strong spot. That includes you people, with the ventilators that nobody had. Nobody that needed a ventilator, didn't get a ventilator. Now we're supplying them all over the world. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30% greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. Think of that. You don't hear these numbers. Cases in the US have declined by 28% nationwide over the last month, and hospitalizations and deaths have declined radically over the last week. Three vaccines are in final stage of clinical trials. Would have taken two years for another president. I was going to say a normal president, but they'll hit me with … A little truth to that too. Now, but for another president, especially, in the last administration, they had the H1N1 pandemic. It was called Swine flu. You know, Joe always calls it the N1H1. He gets it mixed up. No, it's the H1N1, Joee. Not that it matters, I guess. No. Do you ever notice, he's always calling it the other. He calls it the opposite. He has no clue where he is, but he keeps saying, ""Oh, if he was,"" well he didn't want the ban China, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by banning China. I was the only one that wanted to do it, actually. Then we banned Europe because I saw what was happening in Italy and Spain and France. We banned Europe. We saved hundreds of thousands. If I didn't do the closing and the opening, so we're at 175,000, far too … look, one is too much because this was given to us by China, and it's a disgrace. It's a disgrace. They could have stopped it. They stopped it from going into China, but not going to the rest of the world, including our country. It's a disgrace. But think of it. Joe Biden got the worst marks you've ever seen for his handling of the H1NI Swine flu. They said it was incompetent, and the head guy, who now he's trying to retract. It's a little tough. That's one great thing about the tape. He said it was horrible. He said, we did a horrible job. He said, they got lucky. It's not contagious like this. We got, this is a tough one. I can look at that guy and he'll catch it. Right there, and he's very far away from me. It's a tough one, because it's so contagious. I tell you what, our Vice-President, Mike Pence, and the task force, headed up by Mike and working along with a lot of great people, they've done a fantastic job and they just get no credit. If I was a Democrat, a different president, and they did the same job, they'd say it was one of the greatest jobs they've ever seen. But take a look at what they say about the way they handled the Swine flu. It was a disaster. It was incompetent. They called themselves incompetent. They call, and now they're coming in like, well, we would have done this and Biden by the way, was against, you remember, xenophobic, racist, because I closed down China. Then two months later, two and a half, three, and Nancy Pelosi was having dances in Chinatown, right? A month later. No, no problem. I was way ahead. Then Biden comes out and he actually said that I was right, but they said, ""Don't say that, try doing it a little softer than that."" He did it a little bit softer, but we were right. They were wrong. They handled it so badly. Just take a look, because we, I said to my people, ""We've got to fight this a little bit differently because we're getting a lot of fake news, a lot of bad people saying things"", and you look at the stats and you look at how we've done compared to really much easier and much smaller countries, it's amazing. If you took New York out of it, which was a disaster by Cuomo, if you took New York out of those numbers, we would have numbers that would be even better than they are. I could read numbers that would be even much better, because a big percentage of the people that died in this country died because New York was incompetently run by Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo. By the way, just today, there's another credible thing happening. Pfizer, great company, announced that it expects to have the results of its vaccine trials in a matter of weeks, very shortly. Incredible. Under Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to produce a safe and effective vaccine, in that record time that we talked about. This would have been years later. It'll be delivered before, in my opinion, before the end of the year, but it really might even be delivered before the end of October. How do you like that? Wouldn't that be nice? That would be nice. You know why? Not because of the electric. It'll be nice because we want to save people. That's why it'll be nice. That's the important thing. Together, we will defeat the virus. The job we're doing is, the job that all of the people working on it, our generals, our admirals, the distribution, we bought billions and billions of dollars of things, and now we make gowns and we make masks and we make shields and we make ventilators. Very tough. The ventilator's very complicated, very big, very expensive. It's like, I made the statement, it's like building a car, but more sophisticated. They said, ""No, it's not."" They said, they took a ventilator. They took it apart. These people are the worst, the worst. Over the next four years, we'll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. That's what we'll do. Let me just tell you something. If they didn't waste a year and a half of my life on a ridiculous impeachment, based on a phone call that was perfect, this stuff would have all been done. Would have all been done, truly. It would have all been done. Yet, with all of this stuff, the fake Russia witch hunt, the fake Ukraine. How about that? Did anybody read the transcript of that call? It was a perfect call. ""Hey, congratulations. Good luck."" It was like a perfect call. Now they'll take it back and they'll say, ""Well, I don't know."" This was a per … In history, there's never been anything like this. It was a totally lopsided, 100% political witch hunt, and it goes on and on. These are bad people. I really believe they don't love our country. I watched Nancy Pelosi. ""You must wear your mask. You have to wear your mask, and we're going to keep every beauty salon closed in California and all over the country."" Then I see a picture. I say, ""Nancy Pelosi. Well, where's the mask?"" I'll tell you what. She must have treated that beauty salon owner pretty badly. She uses the salon and the salon turned her in? The salon turned her in. I don't think I would have turned her in. I would've said, ""Well, you know, she's a customer. I got to take care of my customers, right?"" But she made them open, and the salon turned her in and the salon did business with her. How much do they hate Nancy Pelosi? Then she made a terrible mistake because you want people that can't be set up. She said, ""I was set up. I was set up by the salon owner. I was set up."" I said, ""Tell me she didn't say that, please."" I just put out, that if she was set up, then she shouldn't be leading the House of Representatives. I want the salon owner to lead the House of Representatives, because she set up … Think of it. She set up the Speaker of the House. That was a big mistake. As soon as I heard, she said, ""Well, she's sent me up,"" Nancy, you're not supposed to get set up. You're representing our country. You know what she should have done honestly? She should have said, ""I made a mistake, sorry,"" and nobody would be talking about, this is like the biggest story. This is the big, crazy Nancy, highly overrated person. Let me just say she is a highly overrated person. They give her such good play. She is a highly overrated person. Look, they just turned off a camera because they don't want me saying that. Just in closing, we will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assault on law enforcement. Surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities and ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens. We will not let them threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. We will end surprise medical billing. We don't want surprise medical billing. You know what happens? It's terrible, but we have ended it. Also, we've signed something that's incredible. You're going to see. Some people say it's bigger than healthcare, and I signed it. Unfortunately it takes place on January 1st. You better elect me. You better elect me. It's called price transparency. I said to my people at the end of the day, what is price transparency? This is going to lower your prices by 50%. You'll be able to negotiate. You'll be able to do things you're not even allowed to do now, with hospitals, with doctors. You get better doctors, you get lower prices. I said, ""When does it start?"" It's a complicated … Oh, did I get, I was fought. You have no idea. Right fellows? You have fought too. But they fought me on this price transparency. It's bigger than healthcare, could be bigger than healthcare. But I said, ""When does it start?"" They said, ""Sir, we have it all set."" ""When?"" ""January 1st,"" ""I said, I'd better win this election,"" because you're going to see some unbelievable price reductions. That includes on drugs, because we're reducing health insurance premiums massively, and the cost of prescription drugs went down the first time in 51 years, last year. But now it's going to go down very big, because we did a favorite nation's clause. I see the drug companies are, they're killing me with ads. They have nothing but cash. They have nothing but money. They're spending because they can't believe … Germany and other countries pay much less than we do. We want to have, what we have to have, is we have to have a comparison of prices. That's what it is called, favored nation clause. I instituted a favorite, so we're paying $2.50 for a pill, and some nation is paying 25 cents for the same exact pill from the same factory, right? We get the 25 cent price. So, what's going to happen that'll go up. Ours will come way down. They can't believe it. The drug companies can't believe, and I will tell you, Mark Meadows is here, our Chief of Staff. Where's Mark? They want to negotiate. They called. We signed it. It's all done. They want to negotiate and they are negotiating, so let's see what happens, but we're going to get you cuts on prescription drugs, the likes of which you've never seen. We'll protect Medicare and Social Security. They will not be able to protect it. It will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. When I took over, NASA was dead. Now it's the most vibrant space center in the world, by far. We will restore patriotic education to our schools and we'll teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God, We Trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania us. It's where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, and where General George Washington, who, by the way, they want all of the name, Washington removed from everything. I haven't been keeping up with it. What did he do? George Washington, they want the name off. Congressman are we okay showing … I don't think you liked that idea too much. George Washington. They want his name off everything, but we'll keep it. I promise you this. As long as you canceled culture, you better have a strong president. Canceled culture. George Washington, can you believe? But he led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware. This is the Commonwealth where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg and where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mined the coal, worked the railroads, forged the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of world. That's in the history of the world and we are making it greater than it's ever been before. That's what's going to happen. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country from these very, very deranged people. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving like never before. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, and together we will work very hard. The people of Pennsylvania, the great, great people of Pennsylvania, where I went to college. It's a place I know very well. But, we will make America wealthy. Again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Pennsylvania."
Trump,"Thank you very much and thank you to the original Lee Greenwood. Thank you. Thank you, Lee. Great guy. Well, I just want to say a very big hello, Kentucky? Great place. It's great to be here in the home of a group called the Wildcats. You ever hear the Kentucky Wildcats? By the way, they play at a very big arena. This place. Look at this. Hello, up there? This is incredible. With thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots, which is what you are. What you are. Tomorrow, the people of Kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific Republican governor, Matt Bevin. He's done a fantastic job. He's done a fantastic job. And we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country, to the rest of the world, that the republican party, you know what we stand for. But you see what's happening with the Democrats, they have gone crazy. The do nothing Democrats, and they're not getting it done. Under Republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring. Kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and America is stronger than ever before. True. Kentucky's unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country. That's not bad. And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor, he's had to do some things that you had to do. And he's done unbelievably well. It sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future. You had to do it. So I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do. You have the best numbers you've ever had in the history of the state. And with the help of your Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written. We're supporting our police, we're rebuilding our military, we're defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before. The monsters animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead. And the man that took his place is dead also. American Special Forces gave the world's number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell. No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military, which is now stronger than ever before. We've rebuilt it and it was all made in America. All made in America. And our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again. But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical democrats are going totally insane. They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out faith from the public square, and you know this, silence you online, confiscate your guns. You better be careful. The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious. They are after your Second Amendment. With us, nobody's touching our Second Amendment. And that includes the gentleman that's running against Matt. They're after your Second Amendment. We can't let that happen. They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional America American values. All you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic High School. Some of whom are here tonight. The far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live. They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes. They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but Kentucky will never be broken. Kentucky can't be broken. You're too strong and you're too smart. In their craze thirst for power, the democrats are trying to tear our country apart. First, Democrats engineer the Russia hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people, the Russian hoax. Then they did the Mueller scam. You remember that? The Mueller scam. Two years and they said nothing. And then Mr. Mueller testified. That was a wonderful day for me. You remember last week. I don't know Tulsi Gabbard, but Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. I don't know Jill Stein. She's a Greenie and that's fine. She's a Greenie, Jill Stein. But Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also. These people are crazy. Now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, they are corrupt. And Nancy, unlike Kentucky, which is doing great, Nancy ought stop wasting time, go back to her district in San Francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system. What's happened is San Francisco and what's happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats, it's unbelievable. Los Angeles. You take a look at Los Angeles, looks like a third world city. But go back to Nancy's area, look at what's happened. There's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents. And she's wasting all of her time. And you know what, it's backfiring. You see it. But the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation, with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt. Impeachment. Think of it. So today, we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market. Now, that's hundreds of days. So last week, think of this, in the history of our country, it's never done better. And by the way, that's not rich, that's not poor, that's for everybody. Your 401s, how you are doing? Pretty good, right? Pretty good. People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, they've been running the 401s for years. And they totally lost respect for let's say, the husband, totally lost respect. Now they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74%. She says, darling, I love you. You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind. And you know what, if the Democrats get in, that's not going down by 50%, that's going down to nothing. It's going to be worthless. It's going to be worthless. You'll have a depression the likes of which you've never seen. Mark my words. But hopefully, we don't have to even think about it. And that was going to happen here. When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction. And don't forget, that was zero interest. We're paying interest. In other words, people are now getting interest in their money. But that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest. Last week, the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of Americans. To be exact 63 million people, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won. And actually, before we won, they were plotting to overthrow this election. Before we won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, that disgusting Washington Post, look at all these people back there, look. Fake news media. It's the fake news. Look at all of them. What they don't know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years. See, now they're going crazy. Now they're saying, see, I told you, he was a dictator. He wants to take charge in control of our country. These people are crazy said. The guy goes, well, we're going to fight and we're going to … No, no. He's going to win. You know he's never leaving office, don't you? He's never going to leave office. These people are crazy. They're crazy. But that disgusting newspaper that's right there, The Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. All right, you can get them out. Be gentle, be gentle. Be very gentle. You know every time I say, get them out of here, I end up getting sued. They say, he hurt my arm. All right. So be very gentle, please. I don't want to get sued. Be very gentle. Very, very gentle. He's going home to mom. Thank you. By the way, do we love our law enforcement? And in the whole world, even on a Monday Night, I like the Monday Nights because I think we're 58 and 0, that's a good record. Even for the Wildcats, that's a good. We're 58 and 0, but even on a Monday Night, is there anything cooler than being at a Trump rally? Nothing can. With last week's vote, the far left has declared war on American democracy itself. These people are lunatics. In the face of these attacks, Republicans are the most unified that I've ever seen, and I've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time. And the democrats have never witnessed anything like it, and they know they're not going to win in 2020. So let's see what can we do to win, but that's not working too well. You'll see. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander. The Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon. Tomorrow, Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message. You will vote to reject Democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin who's done a great job. Matt's a veteran. He's a patriot. He's done it all. He's been a very, very successful business leader. He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible. Under his leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also. We work together. Now, he is difficult. I have to say, you know, maybe because of the election, but it's okay. Look, he's such a pain, when he needs something for Kentucky like money, like aid, like, he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky. Could you call the head of Some company in Japan, please? I say, ""Matt, do I have to do it?"" Please, please. But isn't that really what you wanted in a governor? That's what you want. He's such a pain in the ass, but that's what you want. And the job he's done, one of the best in the country. Not the best. He's been incredible. Matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration. Thank you. He's pro-worker, pro-life and 100% Pro-Second Amendment. By the way, you're going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote in Democrats. You think I'm kidding? I see what they're saying. I watch what they're doing. They're calling me all the time. You will lose your Second Amendment as soon … I'm telling you. As sure as you're standing here, is anybody sitting? Nobody ever sits. You can sit if you want. No, just stand. You know what they say in the fake news? Look, you've been standing. Nobody sat? I don't know. Isn't that exciting? Nobody sat. You know what they say? No, you know what they say? They say, Trump only got one standing ovation. Because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they don't say the second part. It's great. Great spirit. You know why? You love our country. And you see what's happening. We have turned this big monster ship. We have turned it around. And we need so badly. You know, it's like you plant a tree. It takes a lot. We have to get those roots to hold. We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country, so many things. So many things. The best employment numbers, we have the best of everything. And I think I'm going to count but I think it's like 118. I told you, we have a record stock market today. I think about 100 … I'm going to have to check it. Because you know with the fake news, if I'm off by half a point. If it's 117 and not 118, even if I go under, they report it. They say, he didn't tell the truth. It was really 119. But like a lot, over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history. Think of that. That's incredible. But Matt Bevin has made record investments in education spending for Kentucky students. Education is so important to him. Matt Bevin will defend your Kentucky values. He loves his state. From an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left. Not good. I can't even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left? This guy, Beshear, is a major lefty. You know that, right? Why are we even … Let's just have a good time. Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt? I don't know. How does Kentucky vote for a person … I'm telling you, he will always vote for Pelosi and Schumer and shifty Schiff. How about this guy? How about Schiff. He makes up a conversation. He gets up before the United States Congress. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it. I said, ""I never said that."" He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie. And then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation. And you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that, have you? Because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks, you're going to find out. But these are very dishonest people, shifty Schiff. But Matt's running against these people, and we have to send them a sign because they're dangerous. The radical left named Andy Beshear, who rejects everything Kentucky stands for. That's who they want to win. Beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of Donald Trump. What are the policies? Take care of our vets, take care of our military. We want jobs. We want companies to stop leaving us. They're not leaving anymore. You see, companies aren't leaving anymore. Have you noticed? Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this? I mean, when I said let's do this, I said to our great now first lady. I said, ""Melania, let's give it a shot."" And then, one by one, we were doing good. And what we've done, if you remember before we ran, companies were leaving Kentucky, they were leaving, they will go into Mexico. They were going to China, Japan. They were going all over. Any place but Kentucky. You don't read about that at all. Now they're all coming back. They're all coming back. But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky. The greatest economy you've ever had, he's going to destroy it. And it won't be long. It'll go very quickly. You know, you're all sitting there. Everybody has good jobs. You don't like it, you go find another job. It's like the choice I got from military. I got you choice too. If you don't like your job, you find another one. You tell the boss, I am getting out of here, I don't like this guy. You go get a better job for more money. Beshear doesn't represent you. He represents the Washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. Beshear supported crooked Hillary Clinton, and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics. Open borders, let everyone pour right in. Let them all pour right in. Beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to Kentucky, think of that one. Releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent Kentucky families. He wants sanctuary cities. He hasn't learned what's happened. We had a great election a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina. We won two house seats. We were supposed to lose, probably both of them. We won them by a lot. We won them by a lot. And I think we won them because of the Second Amendment, because it's under assault from Democrats. But I think we won also because of sanctuary cities. Because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad. And I think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot. Beshear is too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky. Tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, Republican. We got to go Republican all the way. I want to bring up a man, and I'm serious about this. This guy works so hard. He's a great natural talent in business, which you needed. And he straightened it out. And I'll tell you what, he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state. Matt Bevin, come on up Matt. So we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington, your great Senator Mitch McConnell. Nobody works harder for Kentucky than Mitch. I will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter. It's up here. I know a lot of people that work hard. He works smart. When the Democrat arsonists in Washington tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob. And that's what it was, it was a mob. There has never been a man treated so badly in Washington as Judge Kavanaugh, previously Judge, now Justice. We got him in, and he's been great, and he will be great. Mitch confirmed two tremendous Supreme court justices. Mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass VA choice and VA accountability for our amazing veterans. Now, I know Mitch's opponent because they came here. Do you remember last year? Slightly different location, and that's okay, it was still the great state of Kentucky. Because Andy Barr had Amy McGrath, an extreme liberal against him. Andy Barr is here with us tonight, and we're going to introduce him, but he beat her. So she said to herself, ""Well, you know, I failed in Congress, now let's go for the Senate."" She wanted to go to the House, now she wants to go. It's not going to work that way. Extreme liberal, anti-gun, lots of different things. Amy McGrath compared my election, think of this one … It's so insulting. I shouldn't say it. Should I say it? Yeah, why not. No, it's so insulting. You know, you work so hard, you love your country so much, and they get up to say things. She compared it to 9/11, a slander upon our nation. She wants open borders. She supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody. She wants to get rid of it. She wasn't too happy with me last year. We came in, Andy, and we did a job on her, and this is going to be easy. She was caught telling donors, Democrats, that she is further left than anyone in the history of the State of Kentucky. Is that what you want? It's not what you want. So next November, the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed Kentucky conservative, Mitch McConnell. But we're going to get back to that later. We'll be back many times. We'll be back here many times. Mitch. Where is he? So President Obama left Mitch, and me, and Rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings for judges. You're not supposed to allow any. You don't do that. You know, they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges, right? Including the Supreme Court, obviously. I came in and I said, ""How many do we have?"" They said, ""How many what, sir?"" I said, ""Judge openings."" And I thought they'd say none, or one or two. He said, ""Sir, we have 142."" I said, ""What?"" I said, ""Tell me again."" He said, ""We have 142."" So Mitch and I and Rand would like to thank very much President Obama, because nobody ever been so generous in their life. Also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and he's really become a good friend of mine. And I'll tell you, he's a little bit different. It's okay. But whenever I've needed him, whenever I needed him, he was always there. It's true. I mean, sometimes like I'd say, "" I don't need you to vote, Rand."" ""Good."" And he'll vote his own way. He's got that little libertarian touch. That's okay. That's okay. But whenever we need, and I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about we, we need a vote, he's so incredible and he's become a really good friend. I want to have him come up for a second. Rand Paul, your Senator, a great warrior. Wow, that was excellent. Whoa. Wow, thank you. Thank you very much, Rand. Great job. He's a warrior. He's a warrior, I've always said it. Also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic, a couple from outside your state, but we'll welcome them also, right? But these are also great fighters, great warriors. Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Brett Guthrie. Thank you, Brett. Thomas Massey. Man we just spoke about won a great grace, Andy Barr. James Comer. James, great. And from an incredible state that we won 2016 that Crooked Hillary said she's going to win that state, didn't come too close at winning that state. It's a great state, and we love the people of North Carolina. Congressman Mark Meadows. Along with some of your local great politicians, and a person that's done a really spectacular job. You know, in Michigan, a woman, she just kept going, she just kept going. Reminded me, by the way, of your governor, from the standpoint she never quit. Now, Republicans hadn't won Michigan in many, many years. She called, ""Could you come again? Could you do it again? Could you come make another speech, please?"" I said, ""All right, this is the last one."" ""No, no, no. How about a couple of more?"" And then Bill Clinton actually told Hillary Clinton, ""You better get going, something's going on in Michigan. You're going to lose Michigan. You better start going."" ""No, no, no. The polls say everything's good."" And we won the great State of Michigan for the first time in many years. And I said, when it came time to picking the Republican Party Chair, head of the RNC, I said, I got to get the woman from Michigan, Ronna McDaniel, to head it up. And when they were saying how sophisticated Hillary Clinton's campaign was … You know, we're not sophisticated, right? I don't think so. Remember all during the … ""Well, she's got the finest computer technology in the world."" Yeah, she paid for it, but she didn't get it. ""She has really fantastic geniuses."" But I had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had. His name was Brad Parscale, and he's here with us. Campaign Manager. Doing a great job. And our numbers are looking very good. But think of it, we're one day short of a year now. Can you believe it? Less than a year. It begins November 3rd this time. We had that great, great date, oh boy, November 8th remember? Was there ever a day like that in television history? And they have no idea, because when we do hang it up, they're all out of business. They know that. That's why I think that we will get … I expect to get a full, hearty, unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing New York Times, and from the Amazon Washington Post. You know, before the election started, about a month before I announced that I was going to do this, I said, ""I'm going to become a politician. I can't believe it. I'm going to become a politician."" But I looked at the New York Times, and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store, right? The wind would blow it away. It was dead. I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail. But we built it up. They do stories … In my entire life, I had a few stories on the front page of the New York Times, and now if I have three or four a day, it's like, ""Why are they not covering me anymore?"" And they're all bad. They can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world, and they make it look as bad as possible. In fact, I love dogs, but they gave the dog full credit. They didn't give me any credit. That's okay. The dog got the credit, and the dog will be coming very shortly, by the way, to the White House. But they'll be endorsing us. And you know, all of these crazy, like CNN with its bad ratings, there goes its red light, it just went off. Their red light just went off. See how it is? Well, it's hard. Look, put yourself in their position. They have it on, their covering, and now they know they're ready to get hit, so they turn it off. I mean, I can't blame them. Their red light just went off. No, but put yourself in CNN's position. Without us … You know, cable was not supposed to be a good business, then we came along. It's not me, it's we. They came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, the cities, they came from places, they're still trying to figure out, ""Where the hell did all those people come from?"" It's true. A great Senator from Tennessee, they have early voting, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech, and he saw me because he had a couple of great Congressman friends from Pennsylvania, and he said, ""You know, in Tennessee we have very early voting, and I just left, and I've been doing this for 24 years. And I got to be honest with you, I've never seen so many people vote."" And these are people, they love our country, they're incredible, they work hard, but they never liked what they were voting for, so they really wouldn't vote. Sounds terrible. But they didn't like anything that they saw. They say, ""Sir, I'm seeing people,"" and he said this, ""come out from the valleys, come out from the mountains, come out from areas that they've never come out. We have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor."" He said, ""I can't speak for the rest of the country, but if the rest of the countries like Tennessee, you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation."" And that's what happened. That was a great statement. That was a great statement from people from a great state, also. Tomorrow you must elect the entire Republican ticket, from governor on down, including your next Lieutenant Governor, Ralph Alvarado. Ralph Alvarado. Great, Ralph. You're a good man. And your next Attorney General, Daniel Cameron. Should I bring Daniel up? Get up here, Daniel, come on. Here's a star. Here's a star. Mr. President, I hope you can tell that Kentucky is Trump country. We are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues, and here in the Commonwealth, we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves. And Mr. President, we are going to stand with you in protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Kentuckians. And Mr. President, I make a personal commitment to you as the next Attorney General, we are going to make sure that Kentucky is never a sanctuary state. Good. That's good. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Daniel. Star. A star is born. A star is born. Did you ever see that movie, A Star is Born? Thank you, Daniel. Great. You're next Secretary of State, Michael Adams. Thanks, Michael. Auditor, Mark Harmon. Thank you, Mark. Treasurer, Allison Ball. She's doing great. And Agriculture Commissioner, Ryan Quarles. With the help of everyone here, America is the hottest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Foreign leaders come in to see me, ""Congratulations on your economy."" China's doing poorly, as you know, but they're paying us billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and they've never given us 25 cents before. Billions of dollars. They gave a lot of that money to our farmers, who got targeted, but no longer. They're back buying from our farmers. But we've created 6.7 million new jobs since the election. And if I would have ever said that during the campaign, the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it. Think of that, 6.7. And today, just today, a record, 158 million Americans are now employed, the highest level of employment in our country's history. African American unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows. The history of our country. Hourly earnings, listen to this, are up 9% since the election. Nobody ever thought that was going to be happening. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories. I thought that was a typo. I said, ""How the hell can you lose 60,000?"" It turned out to be right. And you know how I know? Because I've been saying it for two years, and they never corrected me. It's true, two years. I get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign, ""Sir! Sir, we have an emergency."" ""What's the emergency?"" ""Somebody's calling from the media, the fake news. Did you put a comma in the wrong location, sir? Because they consider it to be a front page story."" Okay. Under my administration, we've added nearly 10,000 new factories and many, many more thousands of factories are coming into our country. We reversed it. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts, massive. To lift up distressed communities, our tax law created opportunity zones. Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved, including 144 designated by your great governor. By the way, the other governor. I don't think … Well, I don't know. You know? He's not going to do so well. He'll be calling for a meeting, and I won't be able to see him because I don't like him very much. But I like this one very much, and we're going to help him. We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. We ended the war on American energy. We're now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world. And we ended the war on beautiful clean coal. I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Ask them how they're doing in Paris with it. Not too good. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, and repealed Obama's federal coal moratorium. We're putting our great miners back to work. On trade, we're starting to set records every week, we're reversing decades of Washington disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption. Past administrations did nothing as China looted our factories, and stole up to $500 billion of American dollars. By the way, people can't even believe it. Not 500 million. That's a lot. If you lost 500 million, that's a lot. I thought that was another typo. $500 billion they would take a year from us. We rebuilt China. And I give them a lot of credit, by the way, I give China. What I don't give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama, I don't give them credit because they let it happen. They should have never let it happen. But now we're taking in tens of billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. Just recently, very slow, Slippy Joe … Biden that is, said of China's piracy and plunder, ""They're not that bad, folks."" He always used the word folks. I watched him today, he used the word folks. ""Hi folks. Hi. Hi, My time is up. I got to leave."" No, they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks. So I can just see these handlers, because they're handlers, like they use on horses, they're handlers, right? ""All right, get him off now. He's been up there long enough."" So they're screaming, ""Get off, get off! Sleepy Joe, get off the stage, please. Please Joe, you're doing fine. Joe, you're doing fine. You're doing fine."" And then he goes, ""I love being in Ohio,"" but he was in Iowa yesterday. Yes sir. And they say, ""Dammit, he should have left sooner, we told him. Get off the stage, Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe, get off the damn stage."" But he said about, Sleepy Joe, about China, ""They're not that bad, folks. They're not really competition for us. No, they're not."" 500 billion a year, right? He did nothing in eight years, him and Obama. In fact, I'm here because of them, when you think about it. Right? Just thinking. I'm here because of them. Kellyanne Conway, stand up, Kellyanne. Stand up. Another warrior. I just saw Kellyanne. I said stand up. No, but think of it, as somebody saying that. Now look, $1.5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience, who had not anything, got a lot of money from Ukraine, but he got 1.5 billion from China, I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China, they're very tough. China. I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China. They're very tough. That is not the same group of Chinese people that I've been negotiating with. They gave him 1.5 billion. He'll make millions and millions with that. And how about saying, by the way, Mr. President, would you please take over the negotiations that President Trump is no longer handling? Guess what? You would be sold down the tubes so fast, and we're so close. China wants to make a deal so badly. I think they'd love to see another president. They would like to see another president more than crooked Hillary would, okay. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal, which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made. Has to be, because we started down here and they were up there. Has to be. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations? This is what China would love more than anything else. It's not going to happen folks, because we can't let our country go back to hell. We can't do it. We can't let it happen. Because the Bidens got rich while America was robbed, and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in. I watched the last debate, and this weakling named Anderson Cooper saying, well, it's totally unsubstantiated, Mr. Biden, solely answer. What's unsubstantiated? He is on tape doing a real quid pro quo. Sure, it's totally unsubstantiated, sir. I've never seen anything like it. Could you imagine if I did what he did? Could you imagine if Don Jr. or Eric Trump walked out of China while I was, let's say, vice president or president. Let's say they walked out of China with 1.5 billion. Do you think the press would be saying, well, it's unsubstantiated? No, it's something. Let me just tell you something. These people, not all of them, but these people are very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America is not for sale. And we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp, and that's what we're doing with these crazy people. A lot of bad things happened, and a lot of bad things I think are going to be revealed because there's no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with. Let's face it. These are bad people. Thanks to my tariffs, we will soon have over $100 billion from a country that didn't want to do anything with us. And I'll tell you, they started buying our farm product. You see that. They started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done. Last year, I got our farmers $16 billion because they were targeted. And the year before I got them $12 billion. I just took them out of the tariffs, and we had a lot leftover. And I said, congratulations farmers. I love you. I love our farmers. They love me. That's why they did, they targeted our farmers. I said, congratulations. That's compliments of China. And they do. They want to make a deal so badly. Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal. That's the way it is. Because we're doing very well right now with China. We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. A huge win for Kentucky farmers, for Kentucky auto workers, for Kentucky manufacturers. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do nothing Democrats don't want to give the people of our country a victory. It's really, let it be a bipartisan deal. I don't care. It's such an incredible deal for this country, and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. Democrats need to pass the US MCA. We need their votes. Otherwise you can't pass it. And it's up to Pelosi who has to put it forward, but she's too busy wasting their time. So either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess. The Obama Biden's administration's trans-Pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the American auto industry. That would have been one of the great catastrophes. My first week in office, I canceled that job-killing travesty. You know all about it. Under our policies just days ago, Ford and the UAW announced a $1 billion investment in Louisville. 1 billion. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects. They were globalists. I was elected to be president of the United States, not president of the globe. They decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. Tell me, how is that good. They try and convince you it's good. I was a very good student. I'm a very like, we're all smart. We sit back, we listen, and I say, these people are, something wrong with them. Only in Kentucky can somebody be so precise. You're right about, you are right about that. They deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. The money we spend on other country's militaries, but it's coming down. And I'm telling other countries, I'm sorry, you're going to have to pay now. I'm sorry. Pay. Pay. Pay, you got to pay. And they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair. We go in for internet. We want rural, we'll bring it in. And we're bringing 5g into places like Kentucky that haven't been properly served. We're bringing it in all over the middle West, all over the country. And we're really ahead of schedule. We're doing really well. People will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out, but we're doing very well. But you were very much underserved for years. And yet we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of. Doesn't make sense, does it? But after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. We are finally putting America first. Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past. They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world. No thank you. No thank you. That's why we ended the Paris Accord. That's why… We've ended a lot. I don't even want to tell you. But the sellout of the American nation ended the day I took the oath of office and you understand that. Past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones. Then they demanded that America accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions. Take the people, take the people. We defeated ISIS. We. When I took over three years ago, when we took over, when I took over, ISIS was all over. I defeated ISIS. I didn't even know to what extent. I was watching the other night the great Lou Dobbs, and he said, ""When Trump took over, President Trump,"" he used to say, ""Trump is a great president."" Then he said, ""Trump is the greatest president since Ronald Reagan."" Then he said, ""No, no, Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan."" And now he's got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Thank you. We love you too. But we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here. We didn't do that. We're not doing that. You see what we're going and you see what we're doing and you see it's never easy because I get hit by the swamp 15 different ways, but it doesn't matter. We're doing the right thing to protect our communities. My administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries. A lot of people were against it. They said, ""Isn't that terrible?"" Countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible, and we have a travel ban now. We don't take people from those countries. I'm sorry. And we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court, ruled it totally constitutional. On no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration. Democrats want open borders. They want to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets. In the Republican party, we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our Southern border, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May. The wall is being built. It's going up rapidly. It's got a big impact. And I want to thank Mexico. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the Democrats will not do anything to end loopholes. It would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes. Think of the word loopholes. They don't want to end the loophole. If you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities, you have only one choice tomorrow, and that's to vote for Matt Bevin. Democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day. The Democrat's planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate Medicare. What are they doing? I will always protect Medicare for our nation's seniors. It's going to be protected. What they're doing is crazy. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will also protect you with preexisting physicians. How about that? Preexisting physicians. First time I've ever said that, just thought of that. True. Because under their plan, you don't get your own doctor. You know what you get? Whatever the hell you get. That's what you get. Oh great doc, fix me up doc. You mean you want to work on my heart? Who are you, doc? I don't think so. Thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor's help, we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in Kentucky, which is a record. Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith. Anybody in here a person of faith? Great people. The last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs. Last week my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault. It was an assault. And governor Matt Bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children, and there is no better leader than him, what he has done. And together we're fighting for American orphans, foster families, and the sacred rights of religious believers. And he's done a fantastic job. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. And that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and it's the party of the great Abraham Lincoln. We forgot that. Abraham Lincoln. The incredible rebuilding of our military includes over $100 billion investments all across the state of Kentucky. I withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal. It's not the same country. When I came in that country, there were in 18 different sites of confliction, they called it. And now they're a little different, a little different. We'll see what happens with Iran. And I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Remember? He'd go around, oh, thank you so much. He wouldn't apologize to you, but he apologized to others. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Kentucky. The next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you. You have to do this. Look, maybe you'll be late for work. Maybe you'll be late for whatever. I don't want to know everything. Some things I don't want to know, but you have to just put it off. You have to go vote. It's so important. Tomorrow is so, because beyond even the governorship, and it's so important. Because again, your state is setting records. In the history of your state, you've never done this well economically, job wise, unemployment, employment, factories moving in, new factories, open expansion of your car plants. You've never done this well, but you're sending that big message to the rest of the country. It's so important. You got to get your friends, you got to vote. Because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. It just sends a bad, and they will build it up. Here's the story. If you win, they're going to make it like ho hum. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. This was the greatest. You can't let that happen to me. And you know what? You can't let that happen to your incredible state, Kentucky. You can't let that happen. That would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor. But you're going to have a great victory tomorrow. With your support, you have to go out and vote. We will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not backing down and we will never ever back down. So tomorrow, we need you to go out and get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors. Get out and vote for governor Matt Bevin and all of these great Republicans. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress. 2020, we're going to re-elect because of their stupidity. These people are on the run, and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand. And don't forget. Out of 194, we got 194, not one Republican left us last week. And two Republicans, think of that. And the other three couldn't get there because of, but they were votes. They said they were totally votes, had airport problems. I said, you can't do that. Airport problems. But then we had the Democrats. We picked up two Democrats, so we had bipartisan support. That's unusual. I always say because they're lousy politicians, they've got lousy policy, but they do stick together. That's about it. We will elect a Republican Congress in 2020. And we'll have a great speaker of the house in Kevin. We're going to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We'll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words ""made in the USA"". We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years. We've already started. Who would have felt we could have done that? We've started. In the past administration toward the end, we had certain things that we could have done. They didn't do anything. They didn't do anything, but we did. We have it all funded and we started, think of that, AIDS within 10 years will be out of this country. Nobody would have thought that was possible. We will end it. Great, great. I came into my office, they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made. It's incredible what they're doing. And don't forget right to try, by the way, where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines, which they were never allowed to in the past. So instead of traveling to Asia and Europe and all over the world, or going home hopeless and dying, they can now use what we call right to try. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest drugs, greatest labs in the world. They can now go and try. And we are having unbelievable success. Unbelievable. Right to try. We will chart a new era of discovery in space, and someday soon we will land on, believe it or not, the surface of the moon only to go to Mars. You know I said we've done the moon. No, they say, sir, we land on the moon to go to Mars, and that's what we're doing with the moon. And we are really, really advanced. It's moving along rapidly. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. The great state of Kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth. These tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They love their families, they love their country and they love their God. These proud Kentucky Patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage. Our allegiance is to our nation. Our loyalty is to our citizens. And our devotion is to our Creator. For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, the best is yet to come. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Kentucky. Thank you. Go out and vote."
Trump,"Well thank you very much. And I'm thrilled to be back in Wisconsin where we had a very big night a few years ago. You remember that very big night? Remember that? They said, ""Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin."" And since then we've produced everything we said and more and more. Before it was talk. I said, ""I'm going to do this. We're going to take care of your trade."" What we've done with China now, on Wednesday we signed, that's tomorrow. What we've done with the US MCA, what we've done with Japan, $40 billion trade deal that a lot of it has to do with the farmers. South Korea. Oh, you got to love Trump, you got to love Trump. And you're great Green Bay Packers are playing San Francisco this weekend. Good luck. So do we have any Green Bay packer fans here tonight? That's right. And you have a great quarterback who's a good guy, a good guy. As we begin the year, our economy is booming, wages are rising, poverty is plummeting. Crime is falling and America is the envy of the entire world. And then our opponents say, ""We're not going to win. Let's impeach President Trump. Let's impeach him."" We've got the greatest economy in our history. Our military has been totally rebuilt. ""Let's impeach him."" But we've created 7 million jobs since the election, including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs. Nobody thought that was possible. And we will soon be replacing the NAFTA catastrophe, one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world, frankly with the incredible US MCA, Canada, Mexico, a giant victory for Wisconsin workers, farmers and dairy producers, a tremendous victory. And we may get that all taken care of this week or next week. It just needs one more vote and we'll get that out of the Republican Senate. The Republican Senate will be great. Tomorrow we'll also be signing our phase one trade deal with China, massively boosting exports of products made and produced right here in the great state of Wisconsin. So after years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the United States Military to a point that it has never been before and it's now more advanced, more lethal, and more powerful than ever. And last year, our great American warriors, because that's what they are. And they love it. I got to tell you, they love it, right? They love doing that. They wouldn't trade places with me under any circumstances. They wouldn't trade places with all of our great Wisconsin politicians. They want to be a military warrior and we don't want them for that. We want them doing what they're doing. But our great warriors carried out a daring nighttime raid and terminated the founder and leader of ISIS. The animal known as al-Baghdadi is dead and the wicked caliphate is 100% destroyed. And I will tell you when we took over a little less than three years ago, ISIS was all over the place. Now the caliphate is 100% destroyed. Do you remember when I wanted to leave when it was at 98%? I said, let some of the other countries finish it off. We're going home, right? They all said, ""Oh, no sir, please finish it."" So we finished it off to 100%. A few days ago. We took bold and decisive action to defend American lives and deliver American justice. At my direction, the United States military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist, number one terrorist. Do you know who that is? Qasem Soleimani, number one terrorist in the world. Soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans and was actively planning new attacks, but we stopped them cold. And frankly, they already started the attack, as you saw in Baghdad, on our very large embassy in Baghdad. That was already started. And I said to our generals, ""Get there now. We don't want to have another Benghazi. Not on my watch, or on any watch."" They said, ""Sir, we'll be there tomorrow."" I said, ""Nope, you got to be there right now. Get them over there now."" There are thousands of soldiers. They were soldiers. You take a look at that crowd. That was not protesters. They were soldiers, and they were surrounding our embassy in Baghdad. And all of a sudden they see these beautiful, very expensive, I will tell you, brand new Apache helicopters roaming over the top. And then they see our great military. You saw them in the plane, right? Some of them were getting out of their pajamas. They were. I said, ""Don't worry about it."" I said, ""We won't put that on."" But they were sitting there and they were calling a roll call in the plane. Right? And it was a beautiful sight. And these guys were better than Tom Cruise at his best.  Protestors Disturb the Rally. One protester, a very weak voice. If you people wouldn't go crazy every time you see something, he'd go right through and nobody would even know she was there. Now she's going home to mom where she will be in big trouble. Because I guarantee you that mom voted for Trump. And in 10 years from now, when I run yet again, she'll be voting for Trump too. I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding. We drive them crazy. We drive them crazy. They say, ""You know he's not leaving, don't you? He's never leaving."" They say, ""He's going to win. He's never going to leave."" These people, it's called Trump Derangement Syndrome. It really is. You know what they don't know is that if for any reason, after five years we do leave, which we will, because I believe in that stuff. Right? But you know what's going to happen to their industry. They're all going to die and fold up. Going to be very boring out there, very boring. That's why I say at some point, every single one of them will be endorsing Donald Trump. But crazy Bernie Sanders and the Washington Democrats, by the way, Bernie is surging. Bernie is surging. Bernie. But the Democrats are outraged that we kill this terrorist monster even though this monster was behind hundreds and hundreds of death. That's two. Hey, speaking of protesters, have you seen what's happened in Iran? The protesters are on our side. First time ever. They're on our side. In fact, they put this big American flag on the street. And the Iranians, thousands and thousands of Iranians were supposed to walk on it and trample it and step and beat the hell out of it. Every one of them went around that flag. They like Trump. They like you. I'm just your representative, but they like us. They like us. They haven't seen anything like that in a long time. They went around, did you see it? They went around the flag. They didn't want to touch it. They love America. They love our country. That's called progress. That's called progress. But the Democrats are doing everything possible to disparage what we did with the hit on this monster. Many of the young men and women you see walking around without arms, without legs and without … were done by Soleimani. That's what he loved. He loved the roadside bomb. That's what he loved. Thousands and thousands and thousands in Iraq, in Afghanistan, roadside bombs. He was the king of the roadside bombs. Great percentages of people don't have legs right now and arms because of this son of a bitch. Now the Democrats should be outraged by Soleimani's evil crimes, not that decision to end his wretched life. They're saying, ""Well, he was a general. He was this. He was that."" You know what? Number one, he wasn't supposed to be there. He was a designated terrorist by president Obama who didn't do anything about it as usual. As usual, they don't do anything. They designate and they don't do anything about. He should've been killed 20 years ago. Now, here's the story with the Democrats. If I didn't kill him, and let's say we lost three, four, five embassies or bases or thousands of people or hundreds of people or two people were killed, they would have said, ""Trump should have taken him out."" Anything we do, they go the opposite. So we kill him. And that was precision. Some people thought it went much too fast. Went too fast. So we kill him and they say, ""What a horrible …"" If we didn't kill him, they'd say, ""What a horrible thing."" Right? And by the way, they think they caught me. They never catch us. Because Mexico's paying for the wall. You know that. You'll see that. It's all worked out. Mexico's paying. It's driving them crazy. Now they say, ""Okay, he's building the wall. But Mexico didn't pay."" Mexico will pay. And here's the thing. You'll see that it'll come out. We'll do it sometime during the debate or maybe before. Our debate, the real debate that people are going to watch, because nobody's watching. haven't been doing great on the debates. I have to tell you. But we are building this wall. We're over 100 miles right now. We're going to be expanding the length. You have a lot of natural where you have 1,978 miles. You need 500 miles, but 700 would be good, 750 or so would be great. We're going to now get it up. We have all the financing. You think it's easy getting financing when people put … I can get anything from them. I can get whatever I want in terms of money except for a wall. And I made one big mistake. I should have said to them, ""We will not build the wall. We don't want the wall."" They would have insisted that we build it. We would have had all the money we wanted. I made a mistake. I made a big mistake. Now we're building the wall. It's going up and it's going up rapidly and very soon we'll be building about a mile a day. And we should be up to over 400 miles by next year, the end of next year, and shortly thereafter it'll be finished. And it's already having a tremendous impact on people not being able to come into our country. Bernie and the radical left cannot protect your family and they cannot protect our country, nor do they want to, I think. According to Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren, who has somewhat less Indian blood in her than I do, and I have none. Remember? Oh, we hit her hard. But I hit her too early, but now it doesn't matter. She's not going anywhere. But Bernie said, according to her, Bernie said, and I don't believe that he said this, because I don't know him. I don't particularly like him. He's a nasty guy. But I don't believe he said it. It's not his field. You have to know what people say. She said, right, that Bernie stated strongly that a woman can't win for president. A woman can win for president. Fortunately that could happen. Who knows? But she said that Bernie said, ""A woman can't win."" I don't believe that Bernie said that. I really don't know. Just it's not the kind of a thing he'd say. If you want to keep America safe, just vote Republican. We're doing so well. We're doing so well. Now this was … leave him alone. That's all right. Let security just take care of her. Okay, you all right? Get him out here. Good. Good job security. Good job. Do we love law enforcement? And is there ever, ever a better place to be than a Trump rally on some night during some week? The truth, is we have a great time. But you know what? More importantly we get things done. We're getting everything done. But even president Obama's own former National Security Advisor, a highly respected general named Jim Jones, praised our action to take out Soleimani and said it was absolutely correct and it was the absolute right thing to do. I'm sure they like him very much. He sounds like our kind of a guy. So Jim, if they've given you a hard time, come on over to the Republican party. No, he's a respected guy. He said we did the right thing. Everyone knows. They're saying, ""Was the attack eminent? Was it eminent?"" Does the fact that he's killed hundreds of thousands of people and thousands of Americans and horribly killed and wounded thousands and thousands? That doesn't matter. Was the attack eminent? I think they're going to start a new investigation. Was the attack or this horror … and by the way, he was in a country he wasn't allowed to be in. We don't mention that because he was designated and he wasn't allowed to be there. And he was there with the head of Hezbollah, and they were talking about, like Hillary Clinton. They were talking about weddings and working out. Soleimani and the head of Hezbollah, they were talking about weddings, working out. Or Bill Clinton in the back of the airplane with the Attorney General, where they may have made her an offer that you're going to go to the Supreme Court. Or they may have said, ""You're going to to stay Attorney General, but help. Help."" They may have said that. Do you think they would have said that? No. Nothing like that. But do you remember? They talked about golf and grandchildren, right? 45 minutes. I like golf. 45 minutes. I like golf and I love my grandchildren. I don't think I can talk to somebody about them for 45 minutes that I don't even know. 45. I have a beautiful grandchild. He's really beautiful. He's so great. Okay. What else am I going to say, right? Then I took a… Let's talk one or two. How's Tiger doing? How's this one? How's that one? That's another five minutes, right? What am I going to do with the other 35 minutes? Maybe I'm going to talk about Supreme court appointments, et cetera. Got zero. He got zero out of it. He got zero. I'd love to have that money back. It's a lot of money. But I've warned the Ayatollah and the government of Iran that they must not harm, hurt, or kill any protesters. The whole world is watching. It's watching. They've killed thousands of protests. We support the Iranian people and their courageous struggle for freedom. It's incredible what's going on over there. It really is. But we're watching it. We're watching very closely. And we were ready. That night when the attack was made on us, attack was made on us. Remember this, they killed an American, they killed other people just before that. And so we did what we did, right? And they said, it's our turn now. I said, you better be careful when you say it's our turn. Because we had designated targets that you wouldn't know… It would have taken him 30 years to rebuild if that was even possible. It's true, it's true. And we saw those missiles launched, and they were big and they were fast, and they were accurate. Four of them went bad. They fell way short. But 12 of them hit. And I said, man, they are quick. They knew immediately what they were, and they saw those missiles hit. I said, how bad is it? It hit a base. And an hour later or so, we get a call back. I said, how many killed? Nobody, sir. I said, how many hurt? They said, nobody, sir. And I said, they just saved themselves a trillion dollars and a lot of lives. That's true. A trillion, not a billion. A trillion. So they did a very smart thing and we're not looking for regime change. They've tried that with Libya. They go, Hillary Clinton, let's get rid of Libya. Let's get rid of Gaddafi. Let's get rid of Gaddafi. How's that working out? Right? Let's get rid of Gaddafi. That was a Hillary deal. Then you had Benghazi. And see Benghazi, they didn't respond. They didn't respond. Should be. Should be to Iraq. Iraq didn't knock down the World Trade Center just in case anybody had any question. And this guy did kill. He was not a sweetheart. He was a bad guy in every way. But he did kill terrorists, right? And it became Harvard University for terrorists, right? But they did go after him, but he didn't knock down out. You know what I did with the soldiers? They don't tell you the truth, sorry, because there are a bunch of corrupt people back there. I told Turkey, you got to defend your own border. We're not going to defend your border. And we get along with Turkey. We get along, but they've been there for… And by the way, I call it a safe zone. That is the most dangerous safe zone in the world. Okay? I'm looking at the audience, there's about three of you that want to be in that zone, okay? And you're very tough people. But this is the most dangerous… I call it, I call it the safe zone. Some day it may be a safe zone, but I took our soldiers out, because we had an army here and we had a vast number of people here, and they were going to fight. I said, if they're going to fight like they have been for hundreds and hundreds of years, for centuries, let them fight. But we're getting the hell out of there, okay? But the fake news doesn't tell you the right story. But the fake news doesn't tell you the right story. Because what I did is I took our soldiers, and you know what I did? I moved them to the oil area, and we now control the oil. So they said Trump stayed in Syria. Trump said, so people said to me, why you staying in Syria? Okay? A long time ago. You have no idea the things and the decisions I've seen. So they say Trump's in Syria, I didn't pull out. I did pull out. We have the oil really secure. We'll see what happens with it, but we can help our friends, the Kurds, because that's where they got their wealth. And then ultimately it was with ISIS. But right now it's with the United States military. And we also got rid of remnants of ISIS. While we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, democrats in Congress are wasting America's time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts that had been going on by the way, from the day I came down the escalator with our future first lady. Somebody said to me recently, President, President, it was a friend of mine, used to always call me Donald. Hey Donald, how are you doing? Let's go have dinner. Okay, okay, good. Now he calls me President. I told you this before. Calls me pres… They always call me President. President, President, tell me what's happening, what's going on, how's it all going? You're doing such a great job. I said, do me a favor. Call me Donald. I can't. Now when they say, you know what that means, right? That means respect for the office of president. And you know what? We're going to keep that way. We're going to keep it that way. We're going to keep it there. But that's why this November we're going back and we're going to win the House. The Republicans are going to win the House. Because I don't know if you know it. The impeachment hoax, it's a total hoax. This is based… Just think of this. This is based on a perfect phone call. Did anybody read the transcript? It's a perfect call. In fact, if you go back and look at Lyndon Johnson, all of them. Lyndon Johnson was sort of a tough guy. Can you imagine his phone calls? He's probably looking down or looking up, and he's probably saying, these people have gone crazy. That's the nicest call I've ever tracked. Somebody said, I never knew you could be so nice on a telephone call. But this is all based on a simple phone call that was totally appropriate where the president of Ukraine said there was no pressure on us. Didn't even know what they were talking about. The foreign minister said they want to impeach. Impeach the president of the United States over a perfect phone call. It's the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on our country. Ever. I don't know if you've seen. Independent voters and voters I think of all of the voters, including Democrats moving over, we just got a 195 to nothing, the Republicans in the house, which was a fix. Nancy Pelosi says it must be nonpartisan. And she said, it has to be clear cut. Well, number one, never happened. No problem. Number two, look at the vote. Three Democrats voted with us. So I guess you could say it was a nonpartisan vote because they voted with us, okay? But we're going back and we're going to hold the Senate. And we're going to keep the White House, but we're going to win back the House. We're going to win back the House. And I'm thrilled tonight. A man who has become a great friend of mine, he's a warrior. Senator Ron Johnson is here. Come up here. What a good guy. Congressman Bryan Steil. Jim Sensenbrenner. Glenn Grothman. Glenn, come up. Come up. Mike Gallagher. Wisconsin house speaker Robin Voss. Wisconsin state Senate president Roger Roth. State Senate president. Come on fellas. Wisconsin state Senate majority leader Scott Fitzgerald. A friend of mine, a world champion. Would you believe it? Is Sean here? Where's Sean? Where's Sean? Get up here. I love champions. He would climb that sucker. He was the best in the world right here from Wisconsin, right? Congressman Sean Duffy. We miss him. But he signed with CNN. They paid him a lot of money, and they don't put them on. Why? Because I'm pro-Trump. You think that's fair, right? He's pro-Trump. So what they've done is paid him money to silence him because he has a very important voice. Great job. Yeah, I like that kind of a job. I think he's okay with it. He gets his check, they refuse to put him on. He says good things about Trump. We don't want you on. That's CNN. That's how fake right there. Turn the camera on. And a good friend of all of ours, a Kenosha native, Reince Priebus. Reince, come up. Thank you, man. Thank you Reince. This is a great group of Republican people, but more importantly, it's a great group of winners. They have been so great, so they worked so hard and I just want to thank you all for being here tonight. Thank you. Thank you Ron. A great guy. Thanks to strong Republican leadership like Ron, like all of them that you just saw, America is winning again. America is respected again. And America is thriving again like never before. We're doing great. We're the envy of the world. And under my administration, we now have the lowest average unemployment rate of any administration in the history of our country. And in your great state, Wisconsin… You ever noticed with Biden, he's always calling the wrong state? And in your great state of Iowa, Iowa. It's Iowa, right? No, it's Wisconsin. Oh, I meant Wisconsin. Oh, I didn't know I was in Wisconsin. That's fine. How many times has he done that, by the way? Lots of times, he said. It's great to be in the state of Ohio. No sir, you're in Florida. Many times. The sad part about that… Sleepy Joe is right. You know the sad part about that? When you do that, you can't really recover. You can be Winston Churchill, make the finest remainder of remarks, but you get killed. And he does it every time. And the fake news, they give him a total pass and that's okay. It's all right. It's going to happen to all of us someday. Does anybody get that? Yeah. In Wisconsin, the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history. How's that for a sound bite? How do you beat that sound bite, right? So now the people of Wisconsin are going to say, well let's see the state set a record, most successful it's ever been. And by the way, that's because we got a lot of help from a guy named Scott Walker. Your governor. Ron Johnson, all those guys. Because this didn't happen so quickly. But think. So how do you beat that? You have the most successful, lowest unemployment rate you've ever had. And then they say, somebody's going to come and say, well we'll do a better job. Really, you're going to do a better job? The lowest in history by far, your number one economic numbers by far. Oh, let's put somebody else in as president. I don't think so. Right? But here's one that I loved the most. African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country. And here's another one. African American youth, the way it was was so high was so horrible. Youth unemployment has reached an all time low in recorded history. African-American poverty has reached the lowest rate ever recorded also. The only question are you at 70, 80, 90, 97%? He goes higher. What are you at? What's yours? 100%. Not bad. I know who he's voting for. But think of this, because this is what it's about. Is that these companies, these big public companies, they're owned by the people, they're owned by everybody. Rich people, and they're owned by everybody. We have set 141 records on the stock market, highest levels ever in recorded history. 141 records. That means, in less than three years, for 141 days, we set a record. Think of it, we've said 141 records. Who the hell can do that? And if our opponents had won the election, instead of going up, we're very close to 30,000 on the Dow. Nobody thought that was possible. And clearly the fakers back there, nobody thought that was possible. Instead of being up, you would have… I believe, I really believe, because regulation, so important, tax cuts, so important to get it all going. I believe instead of being up massively, whatever the number is, but depending on who you are, changes, but it's all way over 60, 70, 80, you guys know. You would have been down 50, 60, 70. You would have been down at a level, you would probably be extremely depressed, right now. You wouldn't have bought all those brand new keep America great hats. Don't worry, we're never getting rid of MAGA, don't worry. We don't have the courage to get rid of MAGA. The greatest campaign in history. We're never leaving. But you wouldn't have bought those hats. You know why? You wouldn't have the money to buy him. Okay? Now you can buy them, it doesn't mean a damn thing. So let's do it real fast. The poll, right? Make America great again, or keep America great, right? I don't have to go through the whole deal. We're going to do it quick. We're going to do it quickly. Ready? Who likes make America great again? Whoa. They're very loyal people in Wisconsin. Who likes keep America great? All right. So it surprises me every single time. But make America great again, MAGA, has never won one of these polls. You know why? We've rebuilt our military, we've cut taxes, we've cut regulation, our stock market hit records. It's called keep America great. I mean, we've done so much. And I just got a free… See these Democrats, they go out and spend $1 million on a poll. What I do is I take my own poll. And they'll interview 203 people. 203 people say they'll get it wrong. Because I'm always surprised. Make America great again I think is the greatest phrase ever used in politics, right? But under the Trump economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest, fastest, and largest games. You know that right? This is a blue collar boom. They don't like telling you that. Under my administration, the growth in net worth for the bottom half of wage earners has increased 15 times more than under the three previous administrations. That's pretty amazing. Because they keep saying, oh, the rich are getting richer. Well, the poor are doing the best they've ever done. Earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% proportionately. Under eight years of the Barack Hussein Obama administration. Which administration loves spying on people's campaigns? By the way, by the way, could you imagine if it were the other way around and I spied on his campaign? What would these fake news people be doing? More than 300,000 people under Obama, 300,000 people left the workforce. Under just three years of by administration, 3.5 million people have joined the workforce and nobody believed that was possible. 370 companies have signed our pledge to America's workers providing more than 14 million Americans with new training and job opportunities. We're training them. We're getting them, Walmart, so many great companies, they're training people, because they can train a much better than government. 14 million, you know who has worked so hard on that? Everybody, you've heard of Ivanka, right? Ivanka. She had such a passion for it. She's very smart. I said, would you like this? You have no debt. I want to get people working. I want to get them and help families. So I said, all right, good. Look, she's smart. Go do whatever the hell you want to do, it's okay, darling. So she had a goal of a half a million people. She was going to get trained, get into companies. So she'd call Walmart, she'd call Exxon, she'd call all these great companies. And all of a sudden she hit 8 million. Then she hit 9 million. Don't forget, she wanted to do 500,000, but this is her. Then she had 10 million. She just hit 14 million people have been trained by these great companies. 14 million. Ivanka. 14 million, would you believe that's possible? But that's why we have the best unemployment rates, we have the best employment rates. By the way, very close to 160 million people are now working in the United States. Nobody's ever even come close to that number. We've lifted 10 million people off federal welfare programs. Real median income is now at the highest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Think of that. Real median income. Under eight years, so we're here three years right, but really less because when it was done, the stats, it was two and a half. But we have less than three. Under eight years of the Bush administration, household incomes grew $400. Eight years, $400. Under eight years of president Obama, household incomes grew $975,000. That's okay, 975. Eight years, right? Under three years of the Trump administration, household incomes have risen $10,000. Ten thousand. That's why we're doing well. The consumer. $3,100 of which for regulatory cuts, $2,000 for the tax cuts, it's actually higher than that, $2,500 for energy savings, and $5,000 in real wage gains. $10,000. The child tax credit alone, which every Democrat in Congress opposed, is delivering $2,200 a year to the average American family. Who's in favor of that cut. Who's in favor of having that? You? People don't know. They think the Democrats gave it. The Democrats give nothing. They're too busy. They're too busy doing other things. They don't do anything. They're too busy doing other things. We ended the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth. Number one in the world by far. Saudi Arabia, Russia, but we're number one by far. And if I get a couple of additional pipelines approved, which I will very quickly, instead of waiting 20 years to get them approved, it'll increase this by another 22% that will get them done quickly. And they'll be environmentally friendly and all of that. I believe in that. We have eliminated a record number of job-destroying regulations. I brought back the old light bulb. Better light for much less money, if you want it, right? Little things. Somebody said, oh sir, don't mention the light bulb. It's hard to make an elegant speech. I'm saying I brought back the light bulb. So the new light bulb costs you five times as much, and it makes you look orange. And I was more interested in the orange than I was in the cost. But you know what, if you want, you have it. And the new bulb, I don't know if you see it, it's on there. It's a hazardous waste. When that bulb ends, you're supposed to take it to a certain dump and gingerly put it in because it's loaded up with gasses. That's the new… I said to somebody today in Environmental Protection, how many people do that in the country? Sir, maybe none. They throw it into the garbage can. And it's… Wait. And it was just announced from South Korea, makes a lot of our products, unfortunately, I put a tariff on washing machines and refrigerators, right? They just announced that they're building major refrigerator and washing machine plants in the United States. You know why? You know why? Because they don't want to pay the 25% tariff. So they're building them here. That way they don't have to pay the tariff. And just one final thing. I know this doesn't matter, but I said leave it. It's so inelegant to- I know this doesn't matter, but I said leave it. It's so inelegant to talk about it, right? Right? Isn't it inelegant? I'm talking about dishwashers. Wait till you hear the next one. I'm talking about refrigerators. Probably wanting to say to the union, I'll leave it out because I want to get praise for making a … You cannot make a brilliant speech where they say, ""That was such an incredible, elegant speech,"" if I'm talking about dishwashers, sinks, toilets, light bulbs. But sinks, toilets and showers, you don't get any water. They put restrictors on and now they made them permanent. People used to take them out. They put restrictors on. Try going and buying a new faucet. You turn it on, no water comes out, right? We won't talk about toilets, but you know that's … 10, 15, but we don't talk about that. Because I've said this three or four times, the only subject they ever talk about is toilets, so I don't mention … but how about the shower? You go into a shower, and I have this beautiful head of hair, I need a lot of water. I need water. You go into the shower, right? You turn on the water, drip, drip, drip. I called the guy, ""Something wrong with this?"" ""No, sir. It's just the restrictor."" So you're in there five times longer than you're supposed to be. You use probably more water and it's a very unpleasant experience, right? So we're getting rid of the restrictors. You're going to have full shower flow. Full sink. Did you ever go to the faucet? You turn on the faucet to wash your hands and it turns on so easy. It's like this, because there's zero pressure behind it. No water. You go like that, the thing flips on. Whoa. And then, dung, dung. These people are crazy. And then in California, this governor, who has no clue by the way, he has no clue. Governor Gavin Newsom. He sends all the water out to the Pacific and then he just comes up … I don't know if you saw this. They come up with rules and regulations. Starting soon, if you're a person lives in California, you only get 50 gallons of water. Now, it sounds like a lot of water, but it's not. If you take a shower, wash your hands a couple of times a day … It's not. Then it goes down to 47, 46, 45. Can you imagine? You pay the highest taxes outside of New York, where they're not doing a good job in New York. They're not doing good. Everyone's leaving New York for other environs like Florida. It's not good. Because the taxes are too high. Governor Cuomo's got to get those taxes down, got to get them down, and other things have to happen. But here's Gavin Newsom. So, Gavin Newsom, you have the water pouring down from up north, millions and millions of gallons. You know what they do with it? They divert it into the Pacific Ocean, because they have … We must be in Wisconsin. No. Millions of gallons coming down from the north. They have this massive valve. You're talking about a valve, this is a serious valve, and they turn it and it … Because they have a tiny, tiny little fish that's doing very poorly with or without the water. So in the meantime, if you own a home on Beverly Hills, they scream at you if you want to water your grass a little bit, right? But you have no water coming in. They divert millions and millions of gallons. And what we've just done for the people of California is we've made it possible on a federal basis that they don't have to divert all that water anymore. Now that's only good for California, but these are the things we do. And now the last one is we're working on cars. We're making them less expensive and safer. We're giving them a tiny little bit more fuel and you're going to save on average $3,500. You're going to have a heavier car, a little bit, meaning you'll have steel instead of paper mache walls. And we're getting a lot of good response. And environmentally, it's better, because now people … the number is 12. From 12 years ago, with the old gas guzzlers, they'll all be trading in their cars to get the new cars, which they don't do right now. So it's really going to be something, and we're in a little fight with California over that. But I think ultimately we win that one. You'll buy a better car, a safer car, for less money. Not a bad combination. Not a bad thing. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most, we've created opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring into 120 newly designated opportunity zones right here in Wisconsin. And Ron Johnson helped and Tim Scott of South Carolina helped, right? They're doing great. They are doing good. And for decades politicians ran for office promising to defend Wisconsin workers, but then they went to Washington and lined their pockets with special interest cash as they shipped your jobs and your dreams to countries thousands of miles away. Countries that you've never even heard of. Globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob your factories, steal your farms. By the way, no estate tax on those beautiful farms. We got rid of that. So now, if you love your children and you have a farm or a small business or small ranch, or even a large ranch, you have no estate tax. You can give it to the kids. If you don't love your children … Anybody in here does not love their children? There are some. Come on, raise your hand. There are some. You know, they're brats. They're little brats. They're horrible human beings. So if you're one of them, this doesn't help you, because you'll save some tax. The fact is, no estate tax on these small businesses and farms. That's a tremendous thing, because you are dying, you are leaving the business to your kids. They all said, ""Thank you very much, Daddy and Mommy,"" and then they went out and mortgaged the hell out of the place and they ended up losing it to the banks. But we got rid of the estate tax on small farms and businesses and really great things. Little stuff like that we've done that we never said we were going to do, but these people were ransacking your communities. But we are defenseless no more, because at long last you have a president who puts America first. Been a long time. Been a long time. Been a long time. We're putting America first. No issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people than that of immigration. He goes, ""Traitor."" Are you having a good time, sir? I think you are. Goes, ""Traitor."" I guess in a certain way they are traitors, when you think about it. Left wing politicians, I call them the Do Nothing Democrats, support deadly sanctuary cities, demonstrating their contempt, scorn and disdain for everyday Americans. These jurisdictions release dangerous, violent, criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob, attack and murder American citizens. You have it right here. You have it right here. Last year, ICE … I love ICE. I think they're so great. You know, they moved thousands of MS-13 out of our country, thousands, and others too. But ICE officers in this region of our country arrested nearly 7,000 illegal aliens with criminal records. So you have 7,000 illegal aliens having criminal records, including those charged or convicted of murder, burglary, robbery, drug crimes, killings in the most violent way. Right here in Wisconsin, cities run by far left politicians are releasing dangerous criminal aliens who abuse, assault and threaten innocent children. Your children. Last year, a place I like, the sanctuary County of Milwaukee, released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of child. Think of that, of children. He's now at large. They're searching all over and he's looking for yet another victim. They're searching all over. Allowed to go from your sanctuary city. In the city of Madison, police arrested an illegal alien for sexual assault. After authorities released him, he committed violent battery, only to be released one more time. They're looking for him again. Isn't that nice? The same illegal alien was then arrested for a third time in September and charged with multiple sexual assaults, including sexual assault of a child. Now that criminal is once again in Wisconsin jail and I call on your left wing officials to stop the madness and to work with ICE to ensure he is deported the hell back home. Get him out of our country. Democrats stand for crime, corruption and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order and justice. It's true. It's true. We believe Wisconsin should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members by the tens of thousands and we will not let them back. We made a deal with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, where they accept them back. Under the Obama administration, they get them, they bring them back. And Honduras and Guatemala, which they get that, we're not taking them back, but with us, they take them back. They take them back. Very great. It helped a lot when we were paying them hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Think of it. I just said, we're not paying them anymore. All of a sudden they said, ""We would love to have our wonderful gang members back. We would love to have our gang members back, sir."" Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings, seven straight months in a row, and we're being helped by our new 100 miles plus of wall. Illegal crossings are down 78% since May and we have ended catch and release. That was a tough one. Our very big and very powerful border wall is going up at a record speed and we're fully financed now. Isn't that nice? That wasn't easy. That was not easy. We're adding new miles every week and we are on track to soon build that wall. You're going to have a wall like no other. It's going to be a powerful, terrific wall. And walls do work. I hate to say, remember the Democrats, ""You don't need walls."" Oh really? ""We need drones."" They wanted us to put drones flying around, taking pictures of everybody. Now, did you see on part of the new wall two days ago, illegal aliens with drugs on their back were climbing the wall. They got to the top. You know that paddle on top is called a climb resistor. It's very slippery and very hot, very hot, and they got stuck on the wall. They couldn't get off the wall. Did you see that? I was watching the news. I was surprised that the fake news showed it and I said, ""Isn't that a beautiful sight?"" They couldn't get over the wall. Couldn't get off. They had to get the fire department to get them down. Do you believe that? 30 feet up, that's like almost a four story building. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are now. They're going crazy. They're going totally loony. Nervous nancy, how about Nervous … How about her district? Her district is so filthy dirty. It's filthy dirty with all of the things, I won't say it, but the needles and everything else. These are areas that were, 10 years ago, the best in the country and now they're disgusting. She ought to spend more time back in San Francisco taking care of her community, instead of wasting everybody's time. But taking their cues from socialist Bernie Sanders, AOC, all these people, liberal lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million Americans of their private health insurance. Many of you have great insurance. Republicans will never let that happen. They'll probably change their mind before the … See, this is why I don't like talking about it now. I'd rather wait six, seven, eight months, let them say it 5, 000 times when they have to do it, and then talk extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God won five times."" I said, ""I've done one, but I've won. But it's the beep."" But no, seriously, we're all smart people. How is it good when they say, ""We're going to raise your taxes?"" Is the world going crazy? They say, ""We're going to raise your taxes. We're going to open borders. Everybody can come in … for everybody's health insurance. Schooling. You know, one time … we're going to get everybody a Rolls Royce, and CNN or one of them said, ""They never said, and they never promised a Rolls Royce. Donald Trump lied tonight."" I said, ""Every illegal alien will have a Rolls Royce."" They said, ""He lied tonight."" These people are sick. But they're the party of late term abortion, socialism and corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American Dream, and of course, honest Abe Lincoln, right? Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed. We are a movement. There's a movement like nobody's ever seen before. You know, when I mention this, anything I say that's even slightly false, it's headlines. ""Trump said this. These people. He said this."" This is one of the greatest … I would say this. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country. I really believe that. Never been a movement like this. I mean, there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of nowhere won the state of New Hampshire, won Iowa, won South Carolina down the way, won a state some place. But we won 32 states. There's never been a movement like this, never happened before. But we're a movement for all Americans who believe in fairness and justice, equality and dignity, opportunity and safety. We are a big tent and we are a big party of big ideas for the future. That's why African Americans are joining the Republican Party like nobody ever thought even possible. They love us and we love them. And to give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed. It was us, not the Democrats. They came to me, they wanted help, I gave them help. I got it done. I called Republicans that maybe wouldn't have been so inclined, some of them. Some of them very much inclined. Some of them very conservative were very much inclined. But I got the people that we needed. Obama couldn't do it. Bush couldn't do it. Nobody could do it. I got it approved, and from the day it was approved, I got no thanks, I got no credit. And that's okay, because you know, right? But we passed bi-partisan criminal justice reform and that's helped so many people. I mean, you know the story of Alice Johnson. You know so many different stories. It's helped so many people, especially in the African-American community, the Hispanic community. It's helped a lot of people. It's a different world. To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 187 federal judges, a record, who will interpret the constitution as written. 187. Last spring, Wisconsin voters, as you know, elected a great judge to your State Supreme Court, and this spring you have a chance to reelect another terrific judge, Justice Daniel Kelly. Go vote for Justice Daniel Kelly to defend the rule of law in Wisconsin. Daniel Kelly. We are aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and we've done great … Look, until you get rid of it, you never did great, but we have done numbers that nobody thought possible. In 2018, drug overdose deaths, the overdose deaths, fell for the first time in decades, including by 10% in the state of Wisconsin, 17, 18, 19 and even 21% in a couple of states. China is now putting a big stop, a big lid on Fentanyl, which is a disaster coming out of China. Said to president, ""You've got to do it. People are dying, got to do it."" They're doing it. We are fighting very hard for school choice and it's moving along well in Wisconsin. Milwaukee created the first school choice program 30 years ago to free children for failing government schools, and now my administration is working to give school choice to every child in America who needs it. As we continue rebuilding our military, workers are building brand new Humvee replacements … you know about that … in Oshkosh and magnificent new little old combat ships in Marinette. A lot of ships, a lot of Humvees. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, something they've been trying to get for 52 years. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for you, the people of Wisconsin. At stake in our present battle is the survival of the nation. What these people are doing, they will destroy our nation. They will destroy our nation. And our last election was so important. I don't know, maybe the most important ever, but it was so important. I really believe that this election maybe in its own way will be just as important. I can't say more, but just as important, because we need time for that tree to grow. You plant a tree and it takes time. We need time for that tree to grow, and we have other things that we want to do. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020. Have to do it. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all, and I have found out what a swamp it is. Bad people. I have become the expert all what a swamp. You know, when I used to say, ""Drain the swamp,"" I had no idea it would be that bad. But we're winning. We're here and they're not. We're winning. We're winning. Bad people. Dishonest, bad people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration, which now we're already doing. We're already doing a lot of it. You've got to get loopholes. You know, you need their votes. We have loopholes, like visa lottery. We put names in a lottery and they come in, they become American citizens. Do you think these countries are giving us their finest? ""Oh, let's give them our best citizens, put them in."" These people are crazy to allow this to happen, so we're stopping it all. But ending catch and release was a very big thing, and we did that with no Democrat help. They wouldn't do it. It's called loopholes. Who wouldn't want to end loopholes? We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, ""Made in the USA."" We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. Who would've thought that? We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, ""In God we trust."" They'll always be there. We'll never let up remove it. Those words will always be there. From Milwaukee to Monroe, from Bayfield to Green Bay, good luck this weekend. And from West Bend to West Dallas, we stand on the shoulders of the most courageous men and women ever to walk on the face of the earth. Our American ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, landed men on the face of the moon, and made America the greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Wisconsin, the best is yet to come. You watch. Because working together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you."
Trump,"Well, I thank you very much. So I want to start by saying, ""Hello, Nevada. How are you doing? How are you?"" And I'm thrilled to be in Douglas County, but people are coming from all over the place. There's a lot of people for Douglas County, isn't it? We have thousands and thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots, that's what we have. And 52 days from now, we're going to win Nevada, and we're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that we'll negotiate, right? ‘Cause we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that. And it should never happen to another President. That's just a dishonest group of people. But here we are, and we're going to be here for another four years. The governor of your state- … tried very hard to stop us from having this event tonight. He didn't like us having… They can have riots and they can have all sorts of things and that's okay, you can burn up the house, that's okay. We call this a protest because if you call it a protest, you're allowed to have it. It's okay. So if anybody asks you outside, this is called a friendly protest, okay? It's true. You can't have political rallies. That's because of me, because if Biden were here, he'd have about three people. Do you ever see him with his little circles? The circle? You know why he puts the circles? Because he wants to be like correct with COVID, but it's not really because they can't get anybody to fill up a room. So they put these big circles. So he can't get anybody to fill. Nobody wants to go. Oh, boy, the fake news, look at all those people back there, the fakers. That's true. Boy, they covered. Did you see the other day, now they're finding out that to do an interview, an interview, they ask him a question. That means they're giving him the questions, they never gave me questions before. So to do an interview, he demands on getting the questions, and his people write out the answer. So they ask him a question. He goes, ""Bring it up closer, I can't see it, dammit."" Great. This is something. You know, we have a debate coming up in three weeks. And here's the problem. Winston Churchill. Did you ever hear of Winston Churchill? Winston Churchill was a great debater. Great. And if Joe gets off the stage, walks off the stage, if he makes it, which I think he probably will, in all fairness, he's been doing this for 47 years, right? I think he probably will. If he gets off the stage, they're going to say it was the single greatest debate they've ever seen. Winston Churchill was nothing compared to Sleepy Joe. You know that, you know that, they're going to say, ""What a great performance. He was great today. He was great. This guy was great."" Nah, he's not great. But your governor tried to stop us. He tried to stop us. The governor of Nevada, he tried to stop us, and we went to different venues. Kelly O'Donnell, she's a fading reporter for NBC. Do you know that? She was on, she said, ""Well, they have a crowd tonight."" Behind her, it looked like 25,000 people. That's what we have, by the way, a lot more coming in. But she said, ""He's got maybe a thousand people, a thousand."" You know what I got? I have a thousand people here. No, this is the fake news. You know what? It's not a question of how many… They are just a bunch of dishonest people, I've never seen anything like it. Being in real estate and being in New York and being in all over, I've seen a lot of dishonest people. I think the media, the fake news is the most dishonest group of people I've ever seen anywhere in my entire life. And that includes, by the way, leaders of foreign countries that aren't our friends, okay? That's a big statement. They really are bad news. But here we are, and this is really amazing. The governor tried to stop us, he couldn't, but think of this, he's in control of millions of votes. Here's a guy calling venues, telling them not to have the rally, calling different venues, ""Don't have the rally. We're not going to let you have the rally."" And he's calling, this governor who was a political hack, he was a political hack, and then he became governor. And this is the guy that we're entrusting with millions of ballots, unsolicited ballots, millions and millions. And then we're supposed to win these states, and we have a guy that would do that where he won't let us have, and we call it a protest and therefore we can do it. But you want to know something? It's a disgrace. So who the hell is going to trust? They say, ""Trust government."" Well, how would you trust a guy that fought that we aren't here, that we can't have all these thousands of people? Boy, you are really back far. That's… Look at that. No, but seriously. And now he's in charge of the election and the millions of ballots. So if I'm up like millions of votes, he can rig the election, he can rig the election. And I'll tell you what, whether it's in North Carolina, whether it's in Michigan, whether it's in other states where they're sending out, they're going to be sending out 80 million ballots. And it's Democrats. They're trying to rig this election, at every single place in the last year, year and a half, go modern day, forget about… Tiny amounts, a congressional race in New York, a small number of votes. If you go to New Jersey, if you go to Virginia, if you go to Pennsylvania, if you go to California, look at some of these races, every one of these races was a fraud, missing ballots. And I don't mean like 1%. I mean like 20%, 25%, they're trying to rig the election. They should make people, if you register, if you want a solicited ballot, that's where you ask for it. You have to sign papers. You get it because you can't be there. That's one thing. When they send 80 million ballots to people, they have no idea where they're going. Actually, they probably do have a good idea where they're going, and that's our problem. They send 80 million ballots out. Where are they going? Who are they sending them to? Are they sending them to certain areas and not other areas? Are they sending them to Democrat areas? These are all controlled by Democrat governors, like your politically motivated governor. So, just to finish on that, look, just to finish on that, he's a guy that tried to silence us by not having this. And it ended up, our crowd turned out to be a lot bigger than NBC, which is owned by Concast. C-O-N, Concast. C-O-N-C-A-S-T, Concast. It's really Comcast, but I call it con because it's a whole con. I'll tell you what, in the old days, I think it should still be, news when they broadcast had to be reasonably accurate, right? And they had licensing. Today, they can do whatever the hell they want. It's fake news, and it's a disgrace. And you know what, back there, and I'll tell you, it's hurting our country. It's hurting our country. They're the biggest problem that this country has is the fake news media, worse than the Democrats, because the Democrats are their partners. They play together. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years selling out America, offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, depleting our military and sacrificing your children's future in China. I've spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to America, securing our borders, rebuilding our military and standing up to China like never before. Nobody has ever stood up to China like we have stood up to China, and you haven't seen the last of it. Sleepy Joe Biden, who surrendered, you know where he is now, he's in his damn basement again. No, he's in his basement. He's in his basement. But I can be bad to him because he put the most vicious ad on television that I've ever seen. Do you know what I'm talking about? Where I'm standing over the graves of our fallen warriors, our fallen heroes. These are great people, the greatest people there are, and I'm standing over there and they have some sleazebag reporter from a third rate magazine having some source quoting me saying, I won't even use the term, but saying bad things. And there's nobody that loves our military, respects it and the people more than me. And they took… And I didn't even ask. We had 25 people that were witnesses that are on the record already that have said that never took place. It never took place, what they said. And yet pathetic Joe, and he's a pathetic human being to allow that to happen. Here's the problem, he doesn't even know what happened, I don't think. I think he has no idea, but he's a pathetic human being to let that happen, where they put an ad like that, where I'm standing over graves. And then they said, ""He said this,"" with no sources, no nothing. They got nothing. And I have 25 real witnesses with the names, with everything, saying it never happened. And they put an ad like that up, they're a disgrace. But you know the good part? Now I can be really vicious. I can be really vicious. And we'll start by saying, we're going to start by saying that the Democrats are trying to rig this election because it's the only way they're going to win. The only way they're going to win is to rig it. Biden's surrendered your jobs to China. Look, his son walked away with a billion and a half dollars, give me a break, give me a… His son's going to say, ""Dad, you can't take this money away. Don't do it, Dad, please, I don't…"" You know how much experience he had? There's a young man here, he's a very young, young man, handsome young guy. He's about like 12. You know what? He's got more experience than Hunter. Hunter. Where's Hunter? Where is he? With no experience, no knowledge of energy, no job, got thrown out of the military… You know he got thrown out, by the way. I used to be nice about that. Now I don't. Once I saw that ad, I don't have to be nice anymore. Okay, I really mean it. And by the way, on that ad, I know some horrible people, horrible human beings, some of the worst people in the world, I really do, they're horrible, none of those people, and they're the worst, the worst, real estate developers in New York, you don't get much worse. I know some of the worst people in the world, not one person do I know that would say that, standing on top of graves, of heroes, really, not one person. So I will tell you this, so now we can play it like it is. Let's face it, Joe is shot. Let's face it, okay? He's shot. So not that he has anything to do because he won't know what's happening. He'll just be locked up in a room someplace, and the radical left is going to be running our country. Four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years! Thank you. But now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob. You know that. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. You see what's going on with all these democratic or I always say Democrat-run cities and states. It's a disaster. It's a disaster. And we keep saying, ""Let us bring in the troops."" Well, we did it in Minneapolis, we ended it. In 45 minutes, it was ended. They went through two weeks. By the way, we could do it in Portland in half an hour. It would all be over. But we have these stupid people that think… How about that poor mayor? Is that pathetic, Wheeler, is that pathetic? They forced him out of his home. He's now finding a new home, it's so nice. It's pathetic. Honestly, it's pathetic. We could solve that problem in a half an hour, just like we did. And by the way, the US Marshals did a great job in Portland. They did a great job. You know what I mean. If Biden wins, the rioters win, the anarchists win, arsonists, flag burners, they all win. I'm running for reelection to bring prosperity to Nevada, to the whole country. I've been here a long time. I have some things in Nevada that are very good to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China. I do get a kick out of watching a guy, ""Oh, I'm going to do this."" He copied my whole plan. You see, he says, ""Buy America,"" I said, ""Where the hell have you been for the last half century?"" Thank you. Could I ask the fake news to take your cameras and show all the way back there for hundreds of yards, all the way back there. Take your cameras. Go as far as the eye can see. No, no, tell NBC News it's not a thousand people. You can't see it. You can't see it down here. You won't believe how many people. That thing goes back… So the bottom line is when we win, America wins, that's what's happening. And nobody's done to China what I did. Look, billions, tens of billions of dollars of tariffs we took in. I gave $28 billion to farmers. The farmers are doing very well. They're doing very well. Thank you. Thank you, President Trump. 28 billion. 16 billion one year 12 billion. They were targeted. I said, ""How much is it?"" Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, said, ""How much were they hurt by?"" ""Sir, 12 billion two years ago and 16 billion last year."" I said, ""All right, good. We'll take it out of China."" We gave them 28 billion, to the farmers. That never happened before. You think Joe Biden would even think about it? He wouldn't even think about it. He wouldn't even think about it. No, he's more worried about, does he have a teleprompter to answer a reporter's question. The worst part about that isn't the fact that he's doing that, because let's face it, he's unable, okay? It's not that, it's that the fake news would give him the questions. They never gave me the questions. Did you ever give me questions, back there? Did you ever give me… They don't give me questions. The fake news would give him questions, but of course now Donna Brazile works for Fox, so that's gone a long way. Remember? Remember when Donna Brazile gave crooked Hillary the questions, right? To a debate? And then she said, ""Well, I don't think I did it. I don't remember."" I knew she was in trouble when she said, ""I don't remember doing that. I don't remember."" She didn't remember. Oh, okay. Well, as long as you don't remember. It's true. It's true too. It's true. You know what, I used to stand back and I'd say, ""Be quiet, please. Don't say that. It's really not nice."" You know it's true. She deleted 33… Think of it. They'll never find the emails because they were acid washed, deleted. But you know what? She got a subpoena from the United States Congress, right? And she and her lawyer deleted 33,000 emails after she got a United States subpoena. And you say, ""Why isn't she guilty of a major crime?"" Right? And then she took her telephones and she smashed them with a hammer. Right? And then she took the other ones, and she deleted them. And now the Mueller scam, these people, the worst people. I have a friend, a very smart guy, very streetwise guy. He said, ""You have to be the most honest guy in the world to go through three years of investigations, where they have the worst human beings in the world."" They worked for the Democrats. They worked… I mean, Mueller didn't have a clue. This guy was totally… But look at this Weissmann, how bad was Weissmann? He deleted his phone. That's illegal. He deleted everything. They all deleted. And they all said, ""Oh gee, we made a mistake. We're sorry."" They all used the same mistake. They all made… It was, ""Oh gee, we didn't mean to do that."" Every one of them, all of them. I think it was 31 different phones, they deleted. These are criminals we're dealing with. And they've got to… There has to be a repercussion. There has to be a repercussion. We're dealing with criminals. So I don't care if you say it anymore because you know what? She illegally deleted, and her lawyers should go to jail with her, okay? And the fact is the Republican party doesn't play it rough and tough like those people, they don't play it the same way. They're too nice. And we have better policy. Thank goodness we have better… We believe in borders. We believe in no sanctuary cities. We believe in lowering taxes. We have better, but our people don't… We have some that are very good. Jim Jordan, good, right? Jim Jordan. Mark Meadows, good, right? No, we have some very good, but I'll tell you what, we play it so nice, and in the end it's not right because what they get away with… And Obama and Biden got caught spying on our campaign using the intelligence, I put that in quotes, using intelligence to spy on our campaign, and they got caught. They got caught. And if it was me that got caught, forget about it. But they got caught and somebody said, "" Well I know, but he was President."" Oh great, I'm President too. And a hell of a lot better President than he is, I can tell you that. Obama came into office, they gave him the Nobel Prize, like almost immediately, right? In fact, he didn't even know why he got it. He didn't even know, he had no idea why he got it. And he was right about that because nobody else does either. They still don't know, but we've done a lot of things. So we were nominated a few days ago for a Nobel Prize, which is a big thing. Nobel Peace Prize. And then yesterday we were nominated a second time for another Nobel Prize. Now, that's a big thing. To me, it's a big thing, even though obviously it's a very political thing, but it's a very big thing. The Nobel Peace Prize, right? I got, it was just reported. I'm just reporting this, I got zero time on the nightly news, on the network news. Zero, zero. We got zero time. Think of it, the President of your country is honored by being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and your nightly news, ABC, which is terrible, CBS, which is terrible, and probably the worst of all owned by Concast, they spend a fortune on PR, and then every time I get up, I call them Concast and sort of wipe out their fortune. But they are bad people. But NBC is the worst of them all, not one mentioned. These people are corrupt. Not one mentioned, not one mentioned. So your President gets a Nobel and, at least a nomination, and they don't mention it. Joe Biden cannot lead our country because he doesn't really believe in our country. Right now, I don't think he believes in anything, he just wants to go to sleep. That's all. ""Please, darling, I want to go to bed. I'm exhausted. I made one speech yesterday."" ""But darling, they gave you the answers and the questions."" ""I know, but that was a big strain because my eyes, I couldn't see the teleprompter."" This guy is the worst. I am… And you know, it's going to maybe come back to haunt me because we have a rigged election. It's a rigged election. It's the only way we're going to lose, but I'll tell you what, he is the worst candidate in the history of Presidential… He is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. He doesn't know he's alive. He doesn't know he's alive. And I got to know President Xi of China very well, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un. By the way, what happened to the war? I thought we was going to war with Kim Jong-un. Where's the war? Where's the war? Oh, I see. Oh, I see. It never happened, did it? Never happened, did it? Well, maybe some day, could happen. No, remember? ""Trump is going to be … "" You know my personality, right? ""Trump is going to be a war at within the first week after he wins."" Where's the war.?In fact, the peace prize was because I stayed out of wars, and by the way, ended certain Wars that could have happened that you don't even know about. And look what we did just yesterday in Europe, and look what we did with Israel, and you just saw that, with United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Now, after this is over, you'll have like at NBC, this third-rate reporter stand up. They had a small crowd, a insignificant crowd, in a great location. You know how great it was? We landed, we had to drive for 50 minutes. That's how great. But I like it anyway. I'll take it. I'll take it anyway. I like it. You're my kind of people. We love each other. I like it. We landed the big, beautiful Air Force One. I just asked as we're coming in, ""Why couldn't we have landed here?"" I would have rather, then I could have had the plane right behind me. Instead, we have the beast. See the beast. What you don't know is the beast costs almost as much as the plane. It's a hell of a car. It's a walking army tank, the beast. But we could have. I said, ""Why don't we just land here?"" And we couldn't. So I get off the plane. Oh, good. ""How long will it be?"" ""About 50 minutes."" That's a long drive. And driving here, there were tens of thousands of people on the streets with flags. And then you read these fake reporters and they say, ""President Trump is tied in Nevada, tied."" I don't think so. The only way we're tied is if they screw around with the ballots, which they will do in my opinion. Okay? We're not tied anywhere. I asked some people that traveled with Obama. I said, ""Was it the same thing?"" They say, ""Not even a tiny fraction of what you have."" There's not even a fraction. We have more enthusiasm. We have more spirit than any campaign that anybody's ever seen. It's true. And that includes 2016, where the enthusiasm obviously was great. How about all those states that we weren't supposed to win? ""No, he won't win there. He won't win there."" Then all night long, ""Donald Trump won the great state of Texas. Donald Trump won the great state of … "" this and that, and one after another. Was that one of the coolest things, watching their people go crazy? They went crazy. No, they went crazy. How is he going to do in Georgia? Well, I think George is going to be very close. It's going to be very close. They go, ""The polls in Georgia have closed. Donald Trump wins the state of Georgia."" You know why? Because we won by so much, that they can do it simultaneously by saying, ""The polls closed, and he won."" We had many of them. Right? And by the way, we're doing great. I just had … Florida is a biggie, a good one. And we are winning in Florida by a lot, so that's good. A lot. I'll tell you here, because you don't read about that stuff. They don't like to write that. They don't like to write it. They have all fake polls. I'll tell you what, the polls are worse than the writing. Actually, in my opinion, the polls, they're suppression polls, they're meant to make people discouraged, Even me, I'm supposed to be discouraged. And fortunately, four years ago, we weren't discouraged, because if we would have believed the polls, nobody would have voted. The concept is really make people feel so that on election, they go, ""Darling, let's go out to dinner. It's so sad about the president. I wish he was going to win, but let's go out to dinner. Then we'll come home. Let's not bother voting, right? Let's not bother voting."" See, it's a suppression, but my people might don't get suppressed. My people go out and vote. My people go out and vote. There's no suppression. Phony polls. How about the guy? The New York times hired this pollster, this great genius. He never called one wrong. I don't know. Three, 46.. I don't know what the hell … It's called three 40 … What's his deal? 00. We were given a very tiny chance. What chance did he give us? Like 9%, something like that. You know, they gave him millions of dollars shortly before, because he never called one wrong. He called that one wrong. He called that one wrong. And this is the one … I mean, I must tell you they're a little more accurate. At least here they have us even in a lot of places. "" He's even."" Well, we're not even, we're not even. This is going to be the greatest victory. This is a more important election than four years ago, I'll tell you, more important. Because at no time before, has there been a clearer choice between two parties or two visions, two philosophies, two agendas for the future. There's never been anything like this. On November 3rd, Nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, like we had. We had the greatest economy in the history … not of our country, in the world. We were beating everybody. We were beating China. Remember, if you go back, some of you go back, if you go back 10 years, 15 years, five years, everything was … In 2019, China will overtake the United States as the largest economy. And that didn't work out too well for them. That didn't work out. We were just doing leaps and bounds. We were doing so great, and then we got hit with the plague, the China plague. And we're not thrilled. It's a disgrace. Nobody should have died. Nobody should have died. We got hit. The whole world got hit, but they stopped it from going into the rest of China. They stopped it from going into China, but they didn't stop it from coming into the US and Europe and 188 countries. So whether or not we allow Biden to impose the biggest tax increase in the history of our country, $4 trillion, or ban … He wants to ban energy, ban American … He wants to stop fracking. Hey, by the way, when he was running as a Democrat, in the worst debate performances I've ever seen. Okay? What do you think … He was unable to answer anything. Are you awake, sir? Sir, please wake up. And who was the worst? Who treated him the worst? Kamala. Kamala. She's another beauty. She started off as a favorite. She was at 15. Then she went down to 14, to 12, to 10. She was like a dropping rock in water. She was going down so fast. Then she went down to five and four and three, two, and then she said, ""I got to get the hell out of here. This is getting embarrassing."" And nobody treated him worse than Kamala. Right? She called him a racist. She called him everything. She was horrible to him. And he says, ""She was Kamala. She's just great."" Oh, yeah. These people, these people. You're supposed to choose the people that did well. She got out before Iowa, as I remember. Right? She didn't want to run in Iowa, and then Bernie got … Again, this guy is the greatest loser ever because- No, no. No, he's a good sport, Bernie, crazy Bernie. He's so crazy, but he's a good sport, because with Hillary, they really did. Do we have any young children here? I know it's on a lot of television. Could you turn the television off just for a minute, just for about three seconds? He got screwed. Right? Okay. Now you can turn it back on. But then they really did with this last one, because if Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, if she would have left the race one day before the big Super Tuesday, I mean, Bernie would have her philosophy, right? Liberals. And I would say, she'll be president. If he ever wants, she'll be president within the first month or so, I would say. I think it's just an excuse. Using him as just an excuse to get the super libs in there, so they can destroy our suburbs, demolish our Second Amendment, erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous, anti-American lies in school. So under my leadership, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we're doing it again. We're doing it again. You've seen the numbers. And we're developing a vaccine in record time. It will be ready before the end of the year and maybe much sooner than that. They're very unhappy about that. It's amazing. We have a couple of really great experts, one who's … We call him Dr. Scott. You know who I'm talking about? He's great. He said, this is the only time … They were grilling him on television, saying, ""Well, the vaccine's going too fast."" You know why that's too fast? Because they don't want it to happen before the election. He said, ""This is the only thing in the world. I've never seen anything like it. Everybody wants a vaccine. And when we start getting it fast, because President Trump happens to be president … "" and we've done this in record time, years ahead of schedule. If this was Sleepy Joe and Obama, you wouldn't have a vaccine for three years. But listen, he said, ""This is the craziest thing."" So you're going to have a vaccine quickly. Right? And everybody's upset about it. So now they're trying to hurt the vaccine. And they're trying to say as many bad … They know nothing about it, but they're trying to hurt it, and it's a shame. But he said it better than anybody I've heard. He said, ""You're trying to hurt this country by saying bad things about the vaccine, because we're going to produce it early."" It's the craziest thing. Think about it. Now, having a vaccine is good, but we're rounding the turn regardless. We're rounding the turn, and it's happening. I mean, it's happening. You see. Florida is way down. Texas is now way down. Arizona, governor's done a great job. All three governors have done a great job. And Louisiana now, they had a spike, but they had the spike, but the spike was able to be handled, because now we understand. And what we did, we saved millions of lives, because I hated to do it, but we had to close it up, understand this disease, and then open up again. And we opened, but we would have had 2 million, two and a half, or three million people. Think of it. We're at like around 180,000. One is too many. One, too many. But we would've had two and a half, three, three and a half million people. It would not have been acceptable, would not have been sustainable. We've done an incredible job. And these people that have done it with me, the ventilators, the vaccines, the therapeutics, these people … I mean the hospitals, the beds that we built, the ships that we sent to New York, the ships that we sent. To have an ungrateful governor in New York, Cuomo, to have an ungrateful governor. We sent him ships. We sent them ships. We sent them. We built a convention center with 2,800 beds, and he didn't use the beds for senior citizens. He hardly used the beds at all. He hardly used the ships at all. He said we did a phenomenal job, and now he gets political. He wants to get political with me. A real wise guy, but that's okay. You got to see what they are doing between him and de Blasio. That's a beauty. What they've done to my beautiful city. I love that city so much. What they've done is so horrible. The highest taxes in the land, crime all over the place. They're like 300% up in crime. We need Rudy to come out of retirement. But we're defeating the China virus. When Biden was vice president, he was a complete disaster on the swine flu, which was a much easier thing to handle. Joe Biden's own chief of staff said that when Biden managed swine flu in 2009, they quote, ""Did every possible thing wrong."" This is the guy that worked for him in charge of the swine flu. And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in a period of time. And it's just purely a … He said it was just … we were lucky. He said, ""It's just lucky that there weren't great mass casualties."" Different kinds of a disease, a little bit. And what he said is amazing. He said we did nothing right. This is the man that's going to tell us all about building ventilators. You think Joe is going to be able to build thousands of ventilators a month? Which now we're doing, and sending them to all these countries, all over the world, who have no hope of building ventilators, and they need them badly. So it's an amazing thing. The outbreak was so rampant that Obama-Biden, the administration, told States to stop testing immediately, and they ordered the CDC to stop counting cases because they looked like hell, okay? We didn't do that. By the way, the reason we show so many cases, because we have the best testing program in the world, by far, by far."" Biden's record demonstrates that if he had been in charge when the China virus arrived, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. As vice president, he presided over the worst and the weakest and the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. You've heard that before. It was the most pathetic recovery since the Depression. No state was hit harder by Biden's failure than Nevada. And I was out here and that right about that. You got hit hard. This is not the guy you want. But Biden wants to raise your taxes so high. He would eradicate your economy. He'd put on new regulations, and it wouldn't be him again. I'm going to keep saying it. It will be the people that control him. He's a puppet. And then he wants to do a complete shutdown. We're setting records. We just set a job record for four months, 10.4 million people. Listen to this. So when we had this pandemic worldwide, look, it's a terrible thing that a thing like this happened. People were saying we could go to 41, 42% unemployment. You know what we are now? 8.4%. I don't say that's … If you would have said that … And we have the strongest, highest stock market in history, so your 401ks are doing great. If he got in, we would have the greatest depression in the history of our country. I mean it. I think 1929 would look like good times. All right? Because he'd do everything wrong. He'd raise your taxes. He'd raised the hell out of interest rates. He'd do everything wrong. The Biden shutdown will permanently destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of Americans, inflict totally lasting harm on our children and lead countless deaths from suicide. Don't forget when you do these shutdowns, your state is shut down. You got a governor. You shut down, except if you have a riot. You're not shut down for riots. Riots, you can have, they can burn the hell out of the Strip. They can burn the hell out of Reno. They can do whatever the hell they want if it's a riot. But if you want to go to church, you can't do it. If you want to be in a group of people, you can't do it. But there's a lot of harm done on the other side. There's a lot of tremendous harm done. Remember, the cure can't be worse. Remember that. And on the other side, drugs, suicide, depression, substance abuse of different kinds, heart disease. You have tremendous problems on the other side. Open your schools, open up. We got to open up this state. And I guarantee you … And by the way, the states that are open are doing really well. They're doing much better than the ones that are closed. I don't know if you've been seeing the numbers. And this is just arithmetic. The states that are open are doing great. The states that are closed, North Carolina, what he's doing to that great state, he's got it locked down, shut down. Michigan, what she's doing. And we're trying to get Big 10 football by the way, but we won't even. Michigan, what she's doing to Michigan is unbelievable. Take a look at what they're doing to Pennsylvania. And here's another governor in charge of millions of ballots. So I'm going to win Pennsylvania, but what's he going to do with these ballots? Where are they going? Who are they sending? Who's sending it back? Who's signing? They don't even have to have an authorized signature in Nevada. Do you know that? They don't have to have … You don't have to have an authorized signature on a ballot? No. They're trying to rig an election, and we can't let that happen. I hope you're all going to be poll-watchers, I hope you are, because with you people watching the polls, it's going to be pretty hard to cheat. I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to be a cheater. They'll figure a way. No, they are. It's a very dangerous thing. It's a very dangerous thing, and I totally mean it. And I've been at it. And you see people. And by the way, it's not even politics. It's common sense. They said millions of ballots. People are getting ballots. People died and they're getting ballots. They're sending them to dogs. You see that? Dogs got ballot. Everybody's getting ballots. Probably everybody, but Republican are going to get the ballots. Right? And they're unsolicited. So when you say, solicited, because I like solicited better as a word than absentee. Absentee, nobody knows what the hell it's supposed to represent. It's not really a good definition. One is solicited, where you ask … You solicit the ballot. You want it, you sign papers. They send it to you. You send it back. It's okay. It's good. But unsolicited, where they take millions of ballots. So what happens? I happen to think the postal people are great, but what happens if one of the post guys, before he gives the ballots, he takes a whole handful and hands them to some Democrat political operative, right? And so, he hands him a thousand ballots, and the guy doesn't even have to … you don't have to have verification to do that. Now, here's the good news. We're in front of a court. And hopefully, the court's going to rule, because this is the greatest scam in the history of presidential politics. These people are … they've gone crazy. Biden and his party of liberal hypocrites want to lock law-abiding Americans in their homes, which is what they're doing. And they want to keep them out of church. They really do. They're fighting God, they're fighting guns, and they're fighting oil. Think of it. I don't think they'll do too well in Texas. Did you see where they said? ""We think the race will be quite close in Texas, but the president has an edge."" Listen, I'm in favor of oil and energy. I'm in favor of religion and God. Okay? And I'm in favor of our great Second Amendment, guns. So he's against our Second Amendment. Okay, you know who he'd put in charge. Beto, Beto. Or as he says is, ""Beto, Beto."" So when Beto was legit and then Ted Cruz beat him, and Ted did a very good job. I tell you, he did a great job. But Beto went totally south. He's gone crazy. So he now is a big gun guy. He wants to take guns away from everybody. So who did Biden put in charge? Beto. Remember Beto was interviewed in some magazine or third-rate magazine, most of them are, but remember? And Beto said, this was at the beginning before he got beat to hell. I said, ""He thought this was easy, didn't he?"" But remember when Beto said, ""I was born for this."" As soon as I hear somebody's born for running for president, I said, ""He's out. That's the end of him."" Nobody's born for this. This is tough stuff. I had a great life, I'll tell you. My life was so beautiful. What the hell did I do this for? But you know what? You know what? We are doing things that nobody's ever done before. And I say it all the time, and that's what makes me happy. We're dealing with very sick and very bad and evil people. But I'll tell you no administration in three-and-a-half years, no administration has done what we've done in the first three-and-a-half years. But they want to punish you for praying in church while they let agitators and arsonists burn your churches down. Look at Washington. They want to burn the churches down, and that's fine. But you want to go pray in church, they won't let you do that. Just last week, Biden proudly accepted the endorsement of pro-criminal, anti-police, Portland district attorney, who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals, and violent extremists without any charges. No charges. Never saw anything. By the way, all of these places were talking about are Democrat- run, Chicago, New York, Portland, Seattle. The only reason Seattle got settled, because they knew we were going in. We told them, ""we're going in tomorrow morning. We're going to open it up. We're going to take it."" It would have taken us 20 minutes. So they sent people that night, because they didn't want to be embarrassed. But look at what we've done. And so, every place we've touched, we solved the crime, but they have to ask us. If they don't ask us, we're not supposed to do it, but maybe we do it anyway. And it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to … And it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to about one hour. Wasn't that a beautiful sight though in Minneapolis, right? They're burning the poor city down. I love that state. I think we have a chance of winning in that state, first time in many years for a Republican. They're burning Minneapolis. You don't think of Minneapolis that way, right? You don't think of it. The city is burning down. You have this fake CNN reporter, what's his name? Velshi, the nice shaved head. Maybe I should try that, should I try that? No, I don't think … "" Donald Trump went down substantially in the polls, like about 40%. He showed up with a new haircut, it's called the shave head."" Ali Velshi. And remember he said, ""No, this is a friendly protest. It's a friendly protest. And it's really quite nice."" And people are throwing bottles at him, he's being hit with tear gas. This is a friendly protest. And you look over his shoulder and the entire city was burning. Do you remember the scene? The thing looked like it was 30 blocks, it was just burning. And he's talking about, this is all fake news and nobody would have known. I knew it before I did it, but I never knew it to this extent. I never knew it to this extent. It is corrupt. It's fake and they shouldn't be allowed to do it. They shouldn't be allowed. These are far left lunatics that Biden selects to staff his government. There are policies Biden's pledged to apply nationwide. You're going to have the suburbs, they have a plan. It doesn't matter, it's a regulation, very horrible regulation for the … Does anybody live in the suburbs? Because if you don't vote for Trump in the suburbs, okay. Women that live in the suburbs. They say, ""Oh, they don't like Donald Trump."" I said, ""I think they do."" Remember last time, remember it's the same thing. No, it's the same thing. Remember, last time, four years ago, ""Donald Trump will not do well with women."" I said, ""Why am I so bad? Donald Trump will not …"" And then the votes started coming in. ""He's doing very well, Jim, with women, I don't know what's going on."" We did very well with women. We did well with everybody, we did well with everybody. But they have a regulation. And Ben Carson was fantastic, the head of HUD. I said, ""Ben, they're going to destroy the suburbs."" And they wanted Corey Booker to head that program. But the program was already doing damage. They were playing with the zoning so they could build projects in the suburb, projects in the suburbs. And I said, ""We're going to end it."" Somebody said, ""Sir, let's just amend it."" I said, ""Nope, we got to end it. End it, I want to end it. I don't want to have a lesser version."" But if he gets in, they will open up that whole program. They're going to open it up on steroids. They're going to open it up to a level that you wouldn't have believed possible. And he will drive you out of the suburbs. He will drive you out of the … he'll drive you out of everything. They're open up their … I call it the suburban destruction program because that's what they've done. And it's been a horrible program. It's been very unfair to people with the American dream. And let me just tell you something. 30% of the people that live in the suburbs are minorities. They're Hispanic, they're Black, they're Asian, it's the American dream. And they want the American dream and they don't want that to happen. That's why I'm doing so well with African American, with Asian American, with Hispanic American and with women. But don't let them ruin the suburbs because they will put that regulation back immediately, immediately. And don't let them ruin the suburbs because the suburbs are a special place. The suburbs are the American dream. That's where everyone aspires to and that includes minorities and everybody. Don't let them ruin the suburbs. And with that comes tremendous crime. And I was talking the other day, ""Darling, somebody just moved next door. Who is it? It's a representative of Antifa."" She will look at her husband, say, ""Darling, we're out of here. We're out of here."" Antifa. Remember they were trying to blame other people. They don't like to mention the name Antifa. I said, it's Antifa and I was right. I was right. They're bad people. And you know what, they have to pay a price for the damage and for the horror that they've caused, they have to pay a price. And it's so easy. It's so easy. A lot of them now are wealthy. They're like these wealthy, spoiled kids that have no clue about life. They've got arms that are about this big but they were heavy jackets with lots … and you look and you say, ""Oh, that guy looks tough."" And then the jacket comes off and you see these two little … And they go home and they live in a basement too, their mom and dad's basement. But Biden's plan is to appease domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists. Joe Biden is a weak person. He does whatever his left wing, puppet masters demand, you know that. Look, Joe doesn't know what's going on, you know that. I mean, let's be nice about it, okay. And I'm being nice when I say it. He'll never be able to protect your family, your loved ones or your community. If Biden's elected his radical supporters won't just cause mayhem on the streets like you're seeing, all Democrats. We could solve it so fast. Chicago, a few weekends, think of it, 72 people shot, this is shot. Somebody said, ""You mean with bullets?"" I said, ""Yeah, with bullets."" 18 people died. Now we're pulling our troops out of Afghanistan, out of Iraq, you see what's happening. But let me tell you but we don't … there's nothing like that over there. They don't have 18 people killed or 12 people in a short period of time. Well, you have 70 people shot, where you have another weekend where they had, I think a few weekends ago, 38 people have been shot in Chicago. I said, 38? It's not even believable. And now when these people say it, they make it … they try and play it down. And you're sitting there, I said, ""Did I just see 38 people were shot?"" It's just a terrible thing. And it could all be stopped. It could all be stopped so quickly. But they have to respect law and they have to have order. Law and order. But these radical lefts will be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Supreme Court. And you see what's going on there. If we don't … The next president, hopefully it's going to be us, not me, us, but the next president is going to have one, two, three or four Supreme Court justice. It's just, you know, just that time, right? Just that time, going to be a minimum of one, I would say, but it will be a one, two, three or four. And that's going to change the whole makeup of the Supreme Court. That's going to take away your guns. That's going to destroy your second amendment. That's going to change the whole rationale thinking on so many different subjects like you wouldn't believe, including by the way, life, okay. Life, pro-life, anybody pro-life here? No, this is going to change the makeup of this country for 50 years. I don't know that the country will survive 50 years, if that happens, it might not survive five years if that happens. But the next president and you saw, I put out a list of an additional number of very conservative, highly thought of, highly respected judges. And they are the only people that I will pick. Meaning the first list, the second list, it's about 44, 45 people. They are the only people that I will consider for the Supreme Court of the United States. And I'm asking Joe Biden to do the same thing, but he can't because he's got a bunch of radical left maniacs that they want to put on the court. And nobody can get elected, not even with Democrats, rational Democrats, will they vote for some of these people to be on. So far he's refused to do it. I'm probably forcing him tonight to do something, but he should put out a list of his judges so that you know where you stand. Biden supports cutting police funding, you know that, abolishing … and by the way, did you see, we just got Chicago police today endorsed Trump. That's not easy to do. Chicago. New York's finest, New York's finest endorse, Florida, Ohio, Texas. We have everybody. Is there a police officer in the country, if there is, they'll do a commercial. This officer loves sleepy Joe Biden, he's so tough on crime. So Biden's been going down very rapidly in the polls. And now what he's doing is he's playing tough guy, that he's tough on crime. And all of a sudden, he goes from demolished, demolish and defund, okay? But he goes from, let's not give the police any money. Let's not even say defund for him. His people want to defund the police. They actually have places, Seattle, they actually don't want to have police. Minneapolis, they don't want to have police. They don't want to have police. What's going to happen? You saw the commercial we put up. A woman's being murdered. ""I'm sorry. We cannot take your call right now. We will call you back within the next 24 hours."" A woman's being raped, right? ""I'm sorry. We could not respond right now because we have been defunded, but we will try getting there within the next week."" This is what you're going to have. I mean, that was a strong commercial. It had a big impact, but this is what you're buying with a guy like this. This guy you're going to have Portland's all over this country. And we can't allow that to happen. ""Not here,"" he says, ""Not here in Nevada."" Well with your governor, it could happen here too, I can tell. They want to abolish bail. So they want to abolish cash bail like they did in New York. They release people, the horrible criminals in New York, they release them, no cash bail. And he calls law enforcement, Biden called law enforcement the enemy. They're not the enemy. They're our friends. They're our great friends. And without them, we wouldn't be here. Here in Nevada rioters burned the city hall in Reno. Does anybody know that? Do you know that? That's not a pleasant sight. How did you allow that to happen? I would've thought you people would've gotten out there, like, ""You're not going to burn our city hall."" And during the violent demonstrations in Las Vegas a 29- year-old police officer, you know about this, was deliberately shot in the head while he was doing his job, a vicious criminal left, he was a left person, a left. He was a real left, all right. And the, the young officer as you know, he's a young, brilliant, young guy and he's totally paralyzed. Unlike Biden, while I'm President of the United States, I will always stand with the heroes of our law enforcement. And on November 3rd, you will save America. You're talking about saving America. We cannot let this happen to our country. Because I don't know if you can ever come back from what will happen, including our Supreme Court. We're joined tonight by our terrific Republican congressional nominee, who has my complete and total endorsement. Jim, where you Jim? Jim Marchant, Jim Marchant, where are you? A lot of people out there, Jim, it's not easy. Are you doing well? I just looked at a very solid poll. Jim Marchant is a great guy and hopefully he's going to win and you're going to carry them over and you need it, you need it. Thank you, Jim. And also to a man that should have been governor. He should have been governor, what happened? I don't know what happened. Nevada Attorney General, he's a great guy, Adam Laxalt. And he's watching very closely. And I'll tell you, Adam, please, he's a great lawyer, a great talent. And he's going places but you have to watch. He just said, our next governor. I believe that's true. You have my endorsement, but I will tell you this, Adam, if you could, because you're doing a fantastic job watching, watch all these votes coming in on the ballots, the unsolicited ballots. Will you watch it, please? Okay, all right. All right, James Settelmeyer. Where's James? James, look at James, whoa. Look at the size of James, I want you protecting me, James. James is good. You're doing well, I saw a good poll for you too. I think we're all doing well. I think we're all doing well, it's like a family. Thank you James very much. All of you guys, thank you very much. A woman who did a fantastic job, she headed up Michigan. We won Michigan, the first time in decades, Republicans won. She was horrendous, she kept calling me, ""Sir, one more speech, please come over. Okay, I'll do one more, Ronna, Ronna McDaniel. I'll do one more, Ronna, one more."" I do the speech, two days later, I get a call. ""One more, sir. We need one more."" But we ended up winning Michigan, first time in decades. Ronna McDaniel, Ronna. She was great. And I said when I won, I said, ""Well, who are we going to put at the RNC?"" That's Republican National Committee, who we're going to put? And I said, "" How about that woman that ran …"" She was so tough. I said, ""How about the woman that ran Michigan that we won, first time in so many years?"" So thank you, Ronna, great job you're doing, we appreciate it. And another man is doing a fantastic job, who's been a friend of mine for a long time, your GOP chair, Michael McDonald. Michael, great job, Michael. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Mike. How are we doing, Michael? Are we leading, I hope? Okay. I hear we're doing well. Be careful of the ballots, that's the only way we're going to lose. Can't have this happen to our country. And also here are several really great members of a terrific association and they like Trump a lot, the Nevada Trucking Association. Where are they, Nevada Trucking? Nevada Trucking, thank you, thank you. Thank you, fellas, thank you very much. Great job, we appreciate it very much. Those roads are going to get very nice. They're already starting. Tonight our hearts are with all of the communities in the West battling devastating wildfires. I'm going there the day after tomorrow. I'm staying in your state tonight, but I'm going to be going to California. Spoke to the folks in Oregon, Washington, they never had anything like this, but it is about forest management. Please remember the words, very simple, forest management, please remember. It's about forest management and other things but forest management. My administration is closely coordinating with state and local leaders and we want to thank the more than 200,000 people that are working on it and 28,000 firefighters and first responders who courageously and bravely are fighting out there. They are fighting and it's dangerous, it's dangerous. It's rapidly spreading, hundreds of thousands of acres, it's not been anything quite like this one. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the past 47 years. Think of it, he's been there 47 years. And he always says, ""Well, why didn't you do this? Why did …"" The guy just really in all fairness, I've been here three and a half years. So it's not like they haven't been here. He was a vice president for eight years and he only did one thing good. He treated Obama good. I was going to say something else, but they would have scolded me. That's exactly what I was going to say, but I didn't. It's better than you say it. Do you want to shout it out? Go ahead, shout. That's what I said, that's what I was … thank you very … This can only happen in Nevada. And we pass record tax cuts and regulation cuts to keep the family farms and ranches in the family. Nobody even knows this. We virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax. Does anyone have a small farm, medium-sized farm or business? Anybody? If you want to leave it to your children, you don't have to pay tax now because of Trump. I always say it and I mean it, if you like your children, it's great. If you don't like your children, it doesn't mean a damn thing, don't leave it to them. I ended the administrations … and if you look at that last administration, what they were doing on American energy, what they were doing, and now we are the world's number one energy producer by far and we are energy independent. How about your gas prices? That's not too bad, right? You didn't think you'd ever see those prices, those under two dollar prices, did you? Thank you President Trump, I appreciate it, sir. Biden has pledged to abolish the production of American oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas, and he wants to ban fracking, right? So he's in these debates with the other people and they're just eating him alive. He did his best debate against crazy Bernie and I got to ask, why did he get better, all of a sudden? What happened? Why, do you have any idea why? I think I know. Why did he get better all of a sudden? But he did his last event, but he was so bad. And he raised his hand, no fracking. ""There will be no fracking under my administration,"" he said. And you know why I add the word, he said, because they will take what I said and they will put it as a commercial. There will be no fracking under my administration, they'll have me saying that. That's how dishonest these people are. So I always have to add something because … but even then sometimes they'll cut it off at the end. But he said, there'll be no fracking under my administration. Now, all of a sudden he goes to Pennsylvania and his polls aren't looking very good because they do big fracking. And he goes to Texas and he goes to Oklahoma and he goes to North Dakota and he goes to all these places. It's not looking so good. All of a sudden he says, ""I have nothing against fracking. What are you talking about?"" But always follow their first instinct because the first instinct is what is going to happen. And he has to, because he signed … he has a manifesto. I call it the manifesto with Bernie and AOC plus three, all these crazy people. And it's a manifesto and it reads far worse than anything Bernie Sanders ever said. I thought he'd take what Bernie did and move them somewhat to the right. No, he took what Bernie said and they moved way further left. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. But follow the original statements because that's what's going to happen. And they cannot … you know solar, I like solar, but solar is very expensive and it doesn't have the power to fire up our massive plants. We have big plants, including in this great state and you can't fire them up with this stuff. You can't fire it. We need the strength because we're competing against a lot of nations and they don't go through what we do. They don't care about the air and they should, and they should, which is another problem. I took you out of that crazy Paris Climate Accord, because it was totally disaster. No, it was a way of hurting the United States. I tell you, we would have had a close 20, 25% of our factories in order to even … it was so crazy, so expensive but I took you out. I was surprised people, most people, they appreciate what I did. Because you think it was easy doing that? It was actually, I thought it would be devastating. I got one day of bad press, after that, everybody forgot about it. It wasn't that bad. But I did the right thing for our country and we want to have our great plants working. We want to have our great plants fired up. They said manufacturing jobs are dead, right? Sleepy Joe said, ""I'm going to bring back manufacturing."" Really? Well, Obama said, you'd need a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 650,000 jobs. He said you'd need a miracle. And now sleepy Joe is saying that, no, no, no. I've got to bring back … He's not going to bring back anything. I made history by signing an executive order making the official policy of the United States government to buy American and to hire American. Now I did this long time ago. And then I see a sign in front of Joe right here, right here, it said, buy American. Oh great, Joe, thanks, Joe. Where have you been for 47 years? Because for 47 years, Joe Biden did the opposite. He crushed the dreams of American workers and enriched foreign countries. That's how China happened. Hey, look what I've done. I've taken billions, tens of billions of dollars out of China. Nobody else did it before me, I mean, no other president. In all fairness, in all fairness to Obama and Biden, I call him, Obiden because it's easier, Obiden. In all fairness to Obiden, I mean, they didn't do any of that. But now I see buy American. Hey, he also copied on the pandemic. Did you see he copied everything I was doing? Except one thing, he wouldn't have closed the country to China so hundreds of thousands of people would have died from that. But two months, two and a half months later, he admitted that I was right. Thank you very much, Joe, I appreciate it. And yesterday he made, I think he made a mistake. Well, what do you think, the USMCA, what's better that or NAFTA? Well, no, the USMCA is better. Was that Jake Tapper? I like Jake Tapper, was that … I don't think he was doing … I don't think he likes me too much, but that's okay. They said what's better, they said, what's better. He goes, ""USMCA. Well, that's the deal that Trump made. Oh, it is? Oh."" That's a great deal we made. We took the horrible NAFTA deal. We got rid of the NAFTA. We got rid of TPP. We got rid of that terrible, terrible South Korea deal, which Hillary Clinton said, will produce 250,000 jobs. She said, this will produce 200 … she made it. Hillary, crooked Hillary. She made it, no wait, she said it's going to produce 250,000 jobs. And she was 100% right, it produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea, not for us. It produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea. Not for us. South Korea did very well with that deal, but I changed that deal a lot. That's now a good deal. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers. When we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. You're not going to see companies leaving for Mexico very much anymore. They're not going to be leaving your community, going to Mexico, making a product, selling the product back in, not being taxed at the border. Doesn't work that way anymore. It's probably the biggest reason I ran for president if you want to know that… and these stupid, endless wars. I saved the Uni-… but that's one of the reasons Washington doesn't like me. They love those endless wars. You got to ask them, ""Why?"" Do you ever watch where they're very critical of me. I mean, ""We don't like him on foreign policy."" Really? Look what I've done. Look what I've done. Israel… We're signing deals all over the place. These guys that are lecturing all the time, they don't have a clue. They're clueless. They were clueless. That's why for 40 years you got nothing except blood in the sand. That's all you got. Blood in the sand. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from last administration's job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of American jobs. They don't like me too much. Joe Biden's agenda is, ""Made in China"". My agenda is, ""Made in the USA"". That's the way. For the last four years, I've been delivering for our incredible Hispanic… I love a Hispanic community. Oh, there was a poll today. Did you see it? Did you see the poll? Oh, this was a biggie. They had a poll today that with the Hispanic voter, they call them Latino, Hispanic. They use different terms. To me, I just loved the people. I don't care, but let me just… Did you see it? Trump is leading Biden with the Hispanic community. Trump is leading Biden. Well, Hispanics like tough people. They like people that are going to produce jobs. They like… And by the way, the Hispanics understand the border better than anybody else. They're better than anybody else. No, but we're being… you know, it's unusual that a Republican would be leading a Democrat, not… it's habit. You know what the problem is, it's habit. But the Hispanics get it. And we're leading with the Hispanic community. And that's because you had the lowest job numbers in the history of our country. You had the best home ownership. Every statistic was the best. And now we're doing it again, except we're doing it very rapidly. Remember 8.4%. We could have been at 44%, if stupid people ran it, 8.4%. I'm fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods, low taxes and regulations on Hispanic-owned, small businesses. We're fighting. You know, the Hispanic-owned, small businesses, they're great business people. I know it from being in business. They were very tough. They were great business people and they get it. They get it like very few people get it. I'm also standing up for religious liberty. Joe Biden would be… So Joe Biden would be a disaster for all communities, not just the Hispanic communities, pledged to wage attacks on Catholic organizations, like the Little Sisters of the Poor that we're helping. And we're winning with them. We're helping them. They got hit so hard by Oh Biden. They got hit so hard. I remember them in the Supreme Court, the Little Sisters of the Poor. They get hit by Biden. And then he says, ""How wonderful."" He's such a wonderful person. He supports taxpayer-funded, extreme, late-term abortion. And I mean, ninth month, ninth month, ninth month. And he'd allow violent mobs to burn down your business. And he would hand your country over to the socialists. But I believe it's worse than socialists. I do. I think it's a step worse than socialist. And it starts with a C. That is why we're going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote in November. So important. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's so important. We're bringing it back very fast. I think next year is… Next year, I believe will be as good or better than the year we had last year. Unless somebody comes in and decides to quadruple your taxes, then I can't. Then all bets are off, but we're going to have… We're lowering taxes. He's raising taxes. We're going to have tremendous growth. Joe Biden's party continues to attack our incredible border agents. They're incredible people, more than half of whom happen to be Hispanic-Americans. Did you know that? I know all of them. ""Jose, how you doing?"" ""Juan, how you doing?"" Every sixth time, I'd say, ""Hello, Jim, how are you?"" These extraordinary patriots deserve our admiration, gratitude and respect, not Joe Biden's contempt. He's got contempt for these people that are so great and brave. That's a tough job. My administration's achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended the catch and release disaster. Remember you'd catch somebody, ""What's your name?"" ""I don't know."" ""What's your address?"" ""I don't know."" ""Okay. Go into our country. That's okay."" You couldn't arrest anybody. We ended it, stopped asylum fraud and we've deported over 20,000 gang members, including MS13 and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens. Now think about it. Think of that number. Think if you at a half a million people spread throughout the country that were criminal, illegal aliens. Some of these are very violent people and we get them the hell out. We're stopping human trafficking, protecting the victims, most of whom are women, most of whom are women. Human trafficking because of the internet that's a tremendously big and horrible business. These are the worst human beings of all. But most of the victims are women, children to a much lesser extent, but women and human traffickers. And you know what made it that way is the internet. Who would think? It almost sounds like an ancient crime. It's not. It's very modern because of the internet because of the computer. And it's a horrible thing and we've stopped so much of it. We have an incredible group of people that go after these animals. And we built now over 320 miles of border wall and are adding 10 new miles a week. And the wall will very soon be finished. It'll be finished. We've invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. We've rebuilt our depleted… It was a depleted military. Now we have the newest, we have the best we've ever had and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in nearly 75 years, the US Space Force. And we did things that people said couldn't be done. After 52 years, we passed VA Choice in VA Accountability and 91% of our veterans now approve of their VA care. They think it's doing great. The fact is I did more in 47 months as president than Joe Biden did in 47 years. It's true. It's true. I withdrew from last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We eliminated the world's number one terrorist and mass murderer of American troops, Qasem Soleimani. He's dead. He's gone. Biden voted for the Iraq War. He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development. Oh, really? Tell me about it. Tell me about it. Not too positive. Joe Biden has been on the wrong side of history for 47 years. In fact, the secretary of state, secretary of defense said about him, ""He's never called it right. He never called it right."" If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would right now have died. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. You know that, especially with ventilators and equipment and masks and shields. We're delivering life-saving therapies that have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. And you don't hear that from the fake news. Europe's excess mortality rate is 24% higher. And these are statistics that come from people that do this stuff, right? This is not done by my secretary. 24% higher than the United States and despite their punitive lockdowns, they're once again seeing a spike. They're seeing a big spike in cases over there. They did the heavy lockdowns, just like you're doing right here. And they're seeing a spike. And there's no reason for that. The United States has experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation. Think of that. And by far, the fastest recovery. And if they wrote about it properly, it would be a proper thing, a proper thing to do. Through our historic relief programs, we've saved more than half a trillion Nevada cops and jobs and all of this yet. So many people going out. We've saved 42,000 Nevada businesses. Think of that. Biden would terminate this comeback. He wants to end it. He would terminate this comeback. He would put your families in danger. He will totally destroy Social Security. And in my opinion, if you look at what he's going to do to Medicare, they will destroy Social Security. They will. You called it. You know what you're talking about? Exactly, right. He's going to massively raise your taxes. Reimpose crippling federal regulations, destroy your Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. He's going to destroy that and decimate your 401ks and retirement savings and stocks. Your stocks are going to go down like you never saw anything go down before. He'll obliterate your Second Amendment. He'll give you… And he would, he would give free… He wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens that will bankrupt Medicare. He wants to give… You saw him raise his hand. Remember the debate where they're all standing there and he looked around, ""Who's going to give free healthcare to illegal aliens?"" And everyone's raising hands. He's going, ""Oh…"" Now take a look. I'm not kidding. It's sad. It's pathetic. He would end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions 700%, opening the flood gates to terror-afflicted nations. You understand that. He'll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal, illegal aliens. He loves sanctuary cities, meaning the people that control him love sanctuary cities. Biden, pledges to oppose school choice. And he has stated that if he is elected charter schools are ""gone"". They're gone. In the second term, and we've already started it very heavily, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and a limitless future for all Americans. Instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we've been through and we've been through more than any president has ever been through with these characters and they're falling one after another. But you do notice that I hope. One after another. Oh, I see the phones have been wiped out. I wonder what that's all about, but that's a criminal thing you did. We are changing Washington. We are changing Washington. Never forget that they're coming after me because I am fighting for you. And it's true. Over the next four years to conclude, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring economies and a record prosperity, even greater than last year. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices, and believe… We will believe in enforcing the law. We want law and order. We have to have it. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. And we are bringing our troops home as we speak tonight. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. It's already signed, starts on January 1st. I don't want anyone to… I know ours is a big deal. I don't want Sleepy Joe to take care of… Can you imagine? I'll be watching. ""Prices have dropped substantially all throughout the country because of price…"" And I'm the one that got it done. And he'll say, ""What did I do? What did I do? How did this happen?"" And we'll further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We just did favored nations. We're going to come down to the lowest price anywhere in the world because we did a favored nations clause. You know what that is? We will… The drug companies don't exactly like me too much. They're spending millions of dollars on negative commercials. Please understand when you see those commercials, it means your drug prices are coming down. We will strongly protect Medicaid and Social Security, which they will give up. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. And we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ""In God We Trust."" For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Nevada. So very importantly, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and get out and vote on November 3rd. From Carson City to Elko, from Las Vegas to Reno and from Clark County to right here in Douglas County, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty. They want to secure our liberty. Think of it and defend our freedom. Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, innovators and trailblazers, tough people, great people who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, lit up the brilliant lights of the Vegas Strip and transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis. So true. Our American ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth. And we are making it greater than it ever has been. We are making it greater than ever before. We are making it greater than it's ever been. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We're going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Nevada, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much."
Trump,"Thank you very much. Thank you, Minnesota. This is a great state. We are going to win this state in a very short period of time. Thank you. This feels like the day before the election. So we have 20,000-plus people inside. We just set a new record. And we have 25,000 people that we still love, outside. And close to 100,000 people wanted to come tonight. Thank you all. This is great. This is really great. Thank you. I want to thank our great vice president, Mike Pence, and Karen Pence, for being here tonight. It is great to be back in the Twin Cities with the freedom-loving American patriots who make our country run. You know that. You know it. For the next 13 months, think of that, it seems like yesterday, for the next 13 months, we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul, and we are going to win the great state of Minnesota in 2020. America now has the number one economy anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. You know I'm dealing with China right now. They're in Washington. We're going to see if we make a deal. But they want to make it. We're going to determine whether or not we want to make it. But they've been very nice. And today I got a call from one of the top representatives, he said, ""Congratulations, Mr. President, on having a truly great, great economy."" That's pretty nice. We picked up, since the election, trillions of dollars in value. And China has lost trillions of dollars in value. I will say this, if our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now China would become the … It would be the number one economy anywhere in the world. And right now I can tell you they're not even close. Our country is stronger than ever before because we are proudly putting, for the first time in a long time, we are putting America first.  cops love Trump, Trump loves cops. Our bold pursuit of this pro-American agenda has enraged, and you know what's happened, it's enraged the failed ruling class in Washington. Not easy to get them out, but we're doing it slowly, but surely. These corrupt politicians and the radical leftists got rich bleeding America dry. And they knew that my election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country. And that's what they were doing. And that's what they continue to try and do. That is why, from day one, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election, the election of 2016. They're trying. They're not getting very far. They want to erase your vote like it never existed. They want to erase your voice. And they want to erase your future. But they will fail, because in America, the people rule again. Do you remember that, just 19 minutes after I raised my hand and took the oath of office, The Washington Post, a terrible newspaper that doesn't know how to write the truth, published a story, and in this case, they might've gotten it pretty correct, they said, ""The Campaign To Impeach President Trump Has Begun."" That was the headline. Little did we know they weren't playing games. Think of that. That was 19 minutes after the oath of office. Months earlier, Peter Strzok, remember, he and his lover, Lisa Page. What a group. ""She's going to win 10 million to one. She's going to win. I'm telling you, Peter. I'm telling you, Peter, she's going to win. Peter. Oh, I love you so much."" ""I love you, Peter."" ""I love you too, Lisa. Lisa, I love you. Lisa, Lisa, oh God, I love you, Lisa. And if she doesn't win, Lisa, we've got an insurance policy, Lisa. We'll get that son of a bitch out. We got an insurance policy."" And we're living through the insurance policy. That's what it is. The phony Russia hoax. "" Lisa, I love you."" Now the do-nothing Democrat con artists and scammers are getting desperate. 13 months, they got to move fast, because they're not beating us at the polls and they know it, despite the phony polls that you see all the time, their phony polls. You know, polls are no different. Remember I always used to talk about polls, I know polls very well. Polls are no different than crooked writers. They're crooked polls. They're crooked polls. No different. Boy, that's a lot of media. Look back there. That's a lot of media. They are so dishonest. And frankly, they are so bad for our country. They are so bad. And they could be so good for our country. They could be so good. And maybe they'll change, and maybe they won't. I've been waiting for a long time. After I won the last election, I said, ""Finally it's okay. Finally I'll get some great press."" They got worse. They got worse. I said, ""Finally, we're going to get …"" I said to the first lady, ""Darling, we're going to finally get respect. We're going to finally get media and press coverage. It's going to be great. Look at what we've done."" And I'm telling you, they did, they got worse. They know they cannot win. You understand. Well, if you didn't understand, honestly, there's no way anybody could win, because you'd believe them. If you believe them, there's no way anybody could … Because it's like 94% … I can do the greatest things in history, and they'll make them bad to very bad. And if I do a neutral, something neutral, it worked out okay, not great, it's like, ""Give him the electric chair. That was terrible."" Right? No, this is the worst. These people and the Democrats, they're partners. It's a partnership. How about on the newscast, like the word ""manufactured,"" it's manu… And every newscast, ""Tonight, in a manufactured deal along the border …"" The word's never been used … All of a sudden every newscast is using it. It's a talking point given to these fakers by the Democrats. So they know they can't win the 2020 election, so they're pursuing the insane impeachment witch hunt. I've been going through it now for more time than I've been in office. Because, like Strzok with his insurance deal, this was before, remember this, this was before, that statement was made months before I took office. That statement was made months before the election took place. They said, ""Just in case, we're going to have an insurance policy."" That only means one thing, ""We're going to get him out."" So they're telling us. We can't let that ever happen again to another president. And Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, a lot of people, the great Mark Levin. We have a lot of great people. Lou Dobbs, great people. You know what they said? Every one of them, plus many others, ""There's no other man that we've ever met that could have taken it."" It's true. Maybe I'm a little different up here. I don't know. But I enjoy it. To me, I'm energized because we're draining the swamp. The Democrats' brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country. These are bad people. My phone call, as an example, with the president of Ukraine, was perfect. Everybody that looked at it. And the only reason I released it was that the Democrats put out a phony narrative. So I had no choice. And I don't want to do that as president, every time a president from a country calls me, or I call them, we have to release the text. How can you do business that way? Who's going to want to speak to your president? So the president of Ukraine reiterated today at a major news conference, on other subjects, that he was under absolutely no pressure. He doesn't even know what they're talking about. And he used the word, there was no ""blackmail"" during this call. He used that term. So in theory, that should be the end of it. Think of it, a president of the United States who's made our economy, with a lot of help from all of you, frankly, but from Mike and from some of our great senators and some of our great people that we have with us, we made this the strongest economy in our history. We've rebuilt our military. We're taking care of healthcare like nobody's been able to do. What we've done is incredible. And by the way, we're protecting your Second Amendment. If you don't have me, your Second Amendment is gone. So we have the greatest economy, the greatest military. We've rebuilt our military, $2. 5 trillion, because when I took it over, it was a mess. And what do they want to do? ""Let's impeach our president,"" right? I don't think so. I don't think so. I think we're going to have a turnout the likes of which we've never seen in the history of our country. So we were really forced, just to put it away, we were forced. I said, ""Just do it."" Got the approval from Ukraine. I have to ask. I said, ""Hey, do you guys mind?"" They said, ""That's a strange request."" I said, ""Don't worry about it. Do you mind?"" And they said, ""Please, go ahead. Nothing was said wrong on that call."" So we released the transcript of the call, which was so good that that crooked Adam Schiff, this guy is crooked, he had to make up a fake conversation that never happened- A fake conversation that never happened, and he delivered it to the United States Congress and the American people. It was a total fraud. And then Nancy Pelosi said, ""Oh, I think the president said that."" These people are sick. I'm telling you, they're sick. And you know what? Had they waited one day longer, they would have had the transcript of the actual call, word for word. It would've been perfect. Instead, they released it, they went early, they said all these horrible things. You know why? Because they never thought in a million years that I was going to release a transcript of the call. So Nancy Pelosi, upon hearing a false story from a whistleblower that had no clue what was going on in that call, or somebody gave her very bad advice, but also hearing it from shifty shift Nancy Pelosi said, a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the Ukrainian president, ""We've got to impeach him. We've got to impeach him."" Right? And then she saw the call and she said to her people, ""What the hell? Nobody ever told me this was the call."" But she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their hands. The do nothing democratic extremists have gone so far left that they believe it should not be a crime to cross our border illegally, and it should be a crime to have a totally appropriate casual, beautiful, accurate phone call with a foreign leader. I don't think so. As our brilliant White House counsel wrote to the Democrats yesterday, he said, ""Their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions, to our system of free elections, and to the American people."" That's what it is. To the American people. It's so terrible. Democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy. That's what's happening. We will never let it happen. We will defeat them. I mean, look at their debates. These people are crazy. They want to spend $99 trillion to redo buildings all over the United States. I said, ""What about China? What about Russia? What about India? What about all these other countries where that stuff is just flowing out?"" It's all right. Let him give you the answer. Man, did the cops act fast. He's already gone. That's unbelievable. That's the fastest … You know I have … Look, I love law enforcement. I love the cops. I love the police, all of it. Minneapolis, Minneapolis, you've got a rotten man. You've got to change your mayor. You've got a bad mayor. You've got a bad mayor. But you know what? The police … I've done this a lot and every once in a while we'll have very little disturbance. It's really … Actually, is there any place where we can have more fun than at a Trump rally? And we've set every record at every place, virtually, that we've gone. And one of the big musicians said, ""And Trump does it without a guitar."" Can you believe it? Without a guitar. But this guy … So I've had it a lot where … But sometimes it'll take the police like 30 seconds, 50 seconds. It's like Roger Penske when you watch him, who's getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by the way, pretty soon. He won 18 Indy 500s, 18, Roger Penske. But it's like the way they change those tires, takes four seconds to change the whole damn thing. I say, ""How the hell do they do it?"" That's the way these cops just reacted. That was a record. I think it was a … I've had good service, but I've never had anything like that. I look up, the guy is already gone. Ah, we love you with the red shirts. So now the Democrats are making a pathetic bid to save sleepy Joe, sleepy Joe Biden. And you know what? I'd love to run against him, to be honest. Anybody like that. If you can't beat him in a debate, you've got a big problem folks. You can't beat him in a debate, you can't be president. Because what are you going to do against President Xi and Kim Jong Un. You can't beat sleepy Joe, but now we're going to meet with Kim Jong Un? I don't think so. But he's totally owned and totally controlled by the Washington swamp for many years. Two months after president Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy, they put Joe Biden in charge of Ukraine policy. Listen to this. And the press will not write it. They say, ""In totally unsubstantiated charges …"" every time they talk about him. President Trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune. Now you know that's a totally unsubstantiated charge. Really? It's not an unsubstantiated, it's fact. Joe's son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days. By the way, whatever happened to Hunter. Where the hell is he? Where's Hunter? Hey fellows, I have an idea for a new t-shirt. I love the cops, but let's do another t-shirt. Where's Hunter? Where is he? Here's Hunter, being examined by sleepy eyes Chuck Todd or some of these people. Hunter, it's so great that you're here, sir. Hunter, I know they're giving you approximately $168,000 a month. I hear they paid you a big check of $3 million. I just want to speak on behalf of NBC who's absolutely one of the worst. I just want to tell you … Hunter, Hunter I just want to tell you I couldn't be happier for you and your family and I know you don't know anything about energy and I know it's an energy company, but I think they made a great deal, Hunter. And then they fly to China, and I'm dealing with people right now. They're tough as hell, those Chinese negotiators, and Hunter, who's not too smart, Hunter. He goes in, he has a meeting, he walks out in his fund with 1.5 billion, with a B, one point five billion dollars. These aren't the same Chinese negotiators that I'm dealing with, I can tell you. These are not the same ones, but we are doing very well in that negotiation. Now, think of it, where's Hunter? Where is Hunter? I want to see Hunter? Hunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly. Hunter, you're a loser. Why did you get one point five billion dollars, Hunter. And your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good Senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's ass. True. Thank you. Thank you. It's true. It's true. And they're always saying the same thing. Yeah, he got a billion five, we admit it, they admit it, it's nothing, but oh, it's not that same thing, president Trump made a totally unsubstantiated claim about Hunter Biden and his father. It's not unsubstantiated, you crooked son of a guns, it's 100% true. 100%. Even the smart guys on Wall Street, and I know all of them, they are smart. They've never seen anything like that one before. I've called them. Does that ever happen? Never happens. Guy walks in, no experience, no nothing. Walks out with a billion five. Gee. Flies in on Air Force Two with his father, the vice president. Don't forget, that's when he was vice president. So China gives his son 1.5 billion. How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China? I don't think so. I don't think so. Meanwhile, Biden allowed China to rip off America for eight years as vice president, and Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and we're not doing that anymore. Those days are over. The Bidens got rich and that is substantiated. While America got robbed, that's what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends out America, they didn't have tough negotiations. I look at these trade deals and I say, ""Who the hell could have done this?"" If you didn't … If you had no business instinct, no business ability, if you had nothing, if you're dumb as hell, you wouldn't make these deals, they're so bad. I say, ""Who made these deals? Who made these deals?"" But we're ripping them all up and redoing them and they're going to be very good. Wait until you see what happens. Now that I'm your president, you see it. America is winning again and we're respected again as a nation. A brand new report just came out as I'm walking on the stage. Hard to believe, actually. It turns out that Joe Biden was vice president, he worked with the so called whistle blower. This is nothing but a partisan witch hunt, sabotage, and I'm sure they're going to say it's totally unsubstantiated, but one of them wrote this story. Congratulations, by the way. That's very nice. That's really good. That's the way you should do it. Good. Good. Good. In the twisted worldview of Democrats and the media, it's okay for politicians to ship our jobs to foreign countries, flood our communities with drugs and crime, and enrich themselves at America's expense. Their treachery is allowed because they go along with the rigged Washington game, and it is far more rigged. When I ran, I thought it was rigged, but this is crazy what's happening. But if you refuse to bow or bend to the Washington swamp, which I could do very easily, I'd be much more popular. Folks, it would be so much easier. But they smear you, they spy on you, and they target your friends, your family, your staff for harassment, for abuse, for destruction. I came down to Washington with incredible people. We won a great political campaign. They were bright eyed and bushy tailed. that's a nice phrase. They came down, they were happy. They wanted to turn the country around. They wanted to do great things. All of a sudden they get summoned and they get subpoenaed by Robert Mueller. How good was he as a witness? Not too good and by people that were, I call them the 13 angry Democrats, that turned into 18 angry Democrats. It was disgraceful. So people that were going down, ""Sir, what is this?"" I look, ""Oh wow, that's a subpoena."" What the hell is this? They took people … I really mean this. They took people that were full of life and energy and vigor. We had just won the greatest campaign in the history of American politics, it's true. It's true. And they destroyed their lives. They destroyed their lives. They went home. I could name many people, one in particular, who came down, an incredible young woman. She was going to help people. She wanted to help people. She had causes that were so good. She wanted to help people, and she ended up going home, dark, dark. Her life became hell. They ruined people. They destroyed people, good people. People that ended up paying far more money in legal fees than they made. Than they made. They destroyed great people. They're vicious, horrible, and the media was behind every single step. They destroyed so many lives. They destroyed so many lives, and they're continuing to do it. And it's a disgrace. When all of their ludicrous hoaxes have been exposed as frauds, these sinister fakers then tried to impeach you for daring to call out their own corruption. There's nothing like the dirty political establishment, and I have to tell you, this is, friend of mine, very smart, brilliant guy, was with me about two weeks ago. We just got rid of the Russia hoax and then a week later the Ukraine hoax starts. I had a week of like, ""I can think about everything perfect. It's so beautiful."" And he said, ""President."" I said, ""Call me Donald. You've called me Donald for 35 years."" ""I will. Thank you Donald."" I've lost all my friends because they're all scared to talk. Honestly, I'm the president that they can't talk to me anymore. It's like they're afraid. They respect the office. It's true. They say, ""President."" I say, ""Do me a favor, Richard. You've called me Donald for 35 years. Call me Donald, please. I want somebody to call me Donald."" True. He said to me, I just told him call me … He said, ""President, I can't do it."" He said. So he says, ""President, you've been here now for, think of it, almost three years. Can you believe we're here three years?"" We, we, it's we. And we have to promise them no more than 16 years. Okay? No more. No more. 16 more years. I'm only kidding. Now they'll go back. See, he wants to run for more. But he said, ""President, could I ask you a question? It's so important to me."" He's a great businessman, very successful. He said, ""You deal with all of these nations, these great, powerful … Who is the worst to deal with? Is it China? Is it North Korea? Is India? Is it Russia? Please tell me, Mr. Pres, who is the toughest nation to deal with?"" I said, ""You're not going to believe this. It's the USA is the toughest nation to deal with."" The USA. It's true. Because we're dealing with some very sick and deranged people. There is nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a president that they cannot intimidate, own and control. They're trying to stop me because they know that I don't answer to them, I answer to you. It's true. I never say this. I don't think I've ever said it in a speech, but they'll find out if I did. They'll give me Pinocchios, he said it before, but I don't know if I ever said this before. But I make, as president, about $450,000. I give it away. I don't care. I don't want it. I never hear anything. Can you imagine if I didn't. I give it away to … You can only give it, you can't keep it. You can't actually make a gift. You can give it to your different agencies. So I can give it to health, I can give it to transportation, I can give it to military, but I give it away all the time. Now, and if I ever did … But it's 450. If somebody stays from, let's say, a middle East country in one of my hotels and we charge him 392 dollars and 53 cents for staying, and I never heard of the guy and I don't want to hear about him, they say, ""Trump is getting rich off our nation."" I lose billions being president. I don't care. It's nice to be rich, I guess. But I lose billions. If somebody rents a room someplace and they pay me two months in rent or hotel fees, I never heard of the people. I never know who they are. They say, ""Emoluments."" Nobody ever heard of the word emoluments before. Emoluments. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. I tell you, it's cost me billions of dollars to be president. It really has. And at some point I'll probably to prove that, and I look forward to doing it.. It's very easy. It's very easy. And there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created. So in desperate attempt to attack our movement. Nancy and Chuck, two beauties, have given control of the Democrat party entirely over to the radical left, including Minnesota's own representative Ilhan Omar. I know you people. I know you people. I know the people of Minnesota, and I want to tell you, and I also, at the same time, it's both a question and a statement, how'd the hell did that ever happen? How did it happen? How did it happen? Congresswoman Omar is an America hating socialist. She minimized the September 11th attack on our homeland. Where far more than 3,000 people died, saying, ""Some people did something big deal. Some people did something."" She pleaded for compassion for ISIS recruits right here in Minnesota. Omar laughed that Americans speak of Al-Qaeda. You remember that tape? Speak of Al-Qaeda. But when we say something about the United States, you just don't say America with any intensity. Remember that? Representative Omar has a history of launching virulent anti-semitic screeds, whether you like it or not. She's said the US support for Israel is all about the Benjamins. She said that pro-Israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country. Omar wrote that Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them to see the evil doings of Israel and the United States. How do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota? I'm very angry at you people right now. She is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that I'm going to win, and the Republican party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months. Thank you very much. So we're honored to have with us today a special guest, a man that really is a terrific talented writer. He knows a great deal about all those tangled lies of Omar. Mr. Scott Johnson of Power Line. He wrote some stuff, I can't believe it. Where's Scott? Where's Scott? Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Scott. What a job. Man, do you have her figured out. The only problem is, Scott, it's incredible talent, much more talented than most of these people that you heard about. The problem is they never pick it up. They don't want to pick it up, but we pick it up, Scott, and the people get it and we thank you for your great reporting. Thank you. Thank you very much. And Scott reported everything about Omar is a fraud, including her name. Scott reports his sources told him that, quote, Omar's legal husband was Omar's brother and that she had married him for fraudulent purposes. You mean like coming into the United States, maybe? And as Scott says, ""We have seen a plethora of congressional scandals in our history yet we have never seen scandals like Omar's in Congress, and nothing gets done about it."" I hope that some of you people are looking, because what AOC has gotten away with campaign financing and what … I call it AOC plus three, that's what it is. And Omar is one of the three. What AOC has gotten away with all of that money that she used for her personal self with campaign finance is worse, and nothing happens to them, but it happens to you, and it's not fair. The fact is, we're in a struggle for the survival of democracy in America. The only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand- Message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd, 2020. With your help, we will win back the House, we will keep the Senate and we will win the White House. And we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some incredible people that have helped me so much. One of your tremendous talented, tough, Congressman Tom Emmer. Tom. Also a man, you don't want to fight him, and you don't want to play him in hockey because he was tough. He just won, not that recently but pretty recently, and I was out here campaigning for him and working hard, and it turned out to be an easy race because everyone loves him and respects him. Congressman Pete Stauber. And a man who gets in the trenches, and he just doesn't care. He wants to win for the people. He loves you. He loves this state. He loves this country. Jim Hagedorn. Thank you. And a great friend of mine with his incredible family. He's a friend. He's smart. I guess you'd say he's brilliant. His education is incredible, his military career has been incredible. Then he ran for office, and now he's a United States Senator from the great state of Arkansas, Senator Tom Cotton. Great guy. And Minnesota Senate Majority Leader, Paul Gazelka. Paul. Thank you Paul. Minnesota GOP Chairwoman, Jennifer Carnahan. She's been incredible. I said, ""Jennifer, are we going to win in 13 months?"" She said, ""Honestly sir, I've never seen anything like this. It's going to be easy. Don't ever say… Just assume we're two points behind, okay?"" Two points behind. You never ever… Please. Always just assume you're a little behind, but we're going to win this state by so much that people are going to be shocked. Ad plenty of other states too. We had a rally three weeks ago in New Mexico, and New Mexico's a hard state for Republicans, hasn't been won in a long time also. And we had receptivity that was unbelievable. The audience was 40% Hispanic, where we're doing great. And you know, Hispanic, they understand borders better than anybody, better than we do. They understand safety, they understand their job, they don't want people taking it away, they don't want crime. They understand it better. That's why we're doing so well, but we're in New Mexico, and I'm telling you, that was electric. But honestly, all evenings are electric. We haven't had any bad ones. We haven't. They're all electric. A woman who headed up the great state of Michigan for me, a state that hadn't been won in a long time by a Republican for whatever reason, but it hadn't been won. I guess we didn't have the right candidates, right? But a woman who would call me constantly. I'd say, ""I don't want to talk to her. She's giving me a headache."" ""Sir, if you make one more trip, you're going to win Michigan."" I say, ""All right,"" I make the trip, I go back home. I get a call the next morning, ""Sir, we need one more."" This went over and over and over, and we ended up winning the state of Michigan, and I said, ""Who the hell was that woman that kept bugging me to go back to Michigan and speak just one more time every week? One more time, sir."" And her name is Ronna McDaniel. She's fantastic, and she's the head of the RNC. She's great. And our campaign manager, a man who's really been… They used to say that Crooked Hillary had a very very sophisticated campaign. After she lost, they said, ""I guess it wasn't sophisticated."" We had a sophisticated campaign. Nobody knows the world of computers better than this guy. Brad Parscale. Remember when they used to say it? You know, I never got credit. My father used to teach me, if you can do it for less and win, that's good. He wasn't talking politics. The last thing… He's looking down. He's definitely looking down, not looking up. He was great. He was tough, but he was great. But my father would say, ""If you could do it for less and win, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. If you can build a building for less money than the guy across the street, and if it's a nicer building and you can rent for less, you're really… That's like a good thing."" So in the campaign, we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary Clinton, much. And we won. And we won. We won 306 to 223. That's a pretty big… Remember? Remember they said electoral college. By the way, when you run, if you're running, the electoral college is like the 100 yard dash, and the total vote, you don't go certain places. You focus. Electoral college. We have to explain to them, it's different. So we won 306, and do you remember they sued to say one's the 100 yard dash. You practice. One's the mile. You practice. It's a different race. Winning the total vote is much easier in my opinion. The electoral college, I had to go to 22 different states. For the total vote, I'd go to four states maximum, right? Much easier. It's much easier. I'm all for it, but the electoral college is better for our country because it forces you to go places that you wouldn't go. I love Maine. I went to Maine four or five times. I needed one point. Maine gave me one point. And what happened? What happened? I went there numerous times. Everyone said, ""Why?"" Because I was told by these fraudsters back here in the media that Trump cannot get to 270. He cannot get… They had me maximum, if everything worked, right? At 269. So I kept going to Maine, and you know what? We won that one point in Maine. We won it. It's true. But I kept going. They say, ""Why?"" I said, ""Well, first of all, it is really a beautiful place,"" but we won the point. But they said, ""He can not get to 270,"" and I heard this for months and months. I had such a headache, almost as bad as listening to Mike's damn commercials about those pillows. Maybe I need one of those pillows to cure my headache. Does it cure headaches? I think so. But here's the thing. Here's the thing. So they said, ""He cannot get to 270."" In other words, you can't win. You don't get to 270, it's over. You can't win, right? He cannot do it. There's no way of doing it, and they were right. I got to 306. They were right. But I didn't get to 306. You got to 306. We won incredible states. We won incredible states. We won Wisconsin, we won Michigan, we won Pennsylvania, we won North Carolina, we won South Carolina, we won Florida. What a run. Do you remember the evening that we won? I think… Look, forgetting me, I think it was won of all of us together because we all worked hard. I was the messenger, but we all worked hard. That was our victory, not my victory. But that was one of the greatest nights in the history of television, one of the greatest nights, and hopefully it'll go down when we're allowed to get all of this stuff seeded… You know, it's like a tree. You plant it. You plant it. It has to go, but it needs a little… That's why we need the four more additionally years. It's got to grab on and catch, so they can't destroy it. So they can't destroy it. But I think it'll go down, and I hope it's going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country, because it's never happened, anything like that before. And these guys don't even question it. They just sit back and say, ""I guess he's right about that."" I'll never forget the night before, I was at a tremendous arena. The place was going crazy. It was like this, going crazy, and two reporters that hate my guts, they looked at themselves, they looked at each other. Famous shot. They're looking like this and they're saying, ""What the hell is going on?"" They knew. They knew. And I didn't need Beyonce and Jay Z, and I didn't need little Bruce Springsteen and all of these people. They'd get all these people. They'd come in because she couldn't get a crowd. They'd come in, they'd sing. They got Bruce Springsteen. Okay? He'd do about two songs and leave. What happens is, they leave, and then everyone leaves with them, and she's still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. And then they complain. Sometimes I'll use terrible word like hell. The other day I used the word hell. I got hell from… They said, ""He used terrible language."" I used the word hell. It was so bad. But you've got to hear Jay Z, the words he was using, he was using the F word all over the place, and then the next day they say I use bad language. The word hell is a terrible word. These people are sick. But that was an amazing evening. I'll never forget that evening. Look. Outside of your family and your children and things… I love you too, darling. It was one of the highest rated evenings in the history of television. You add up all those networks. Remember the woman crying? Oh my God. No, they weren't biased at all. Now, another very special man who's with us today, but he'll never be a man to me, he'll always be my boy, you know what I mean? Right? He's my boy. He's my little six foot six boy, Eric Trump. And the parents understand that, right? They may be big and strong and older. To a parent, a child is always their boy or always their little beautiful girl, and I know that's probably politically incorrect. They'll say, ""It was terrible what he said about women. Terrible."" But they're our boy and they're our girl, and it doesn't matter how old we get and how old they get, is that a correct statement? And I'm also proud to endorse your next Republican Senator from Minnesota, a man that I've known, a man that is tough and smart, a man that's running against somebody that's never done a damn thing in the Senate, Mr. Jason Lewis. And Jason did a great job in Congress. Congressman Lewis, thank you very much, and thank you for putting up with all of this stuff because I'll tell you, it's going to be nasty. It's going to be nasty. They're going to make up stories about you. They're going to say things that's going to want to make your wife say, ""Why did I marry this guy?"" Just say, ""Don't worry about it. It's just another phony story."" Thank you very much Mr. and Mrs. Lewis. Jason, thank you. And Jason, they can say that about Tom Cotton. He's too perfect, this guy. He can't say… They can't say it about you, Tom. Anyway, good luck Jason. Do well. And I don't know why, but with all of the great people I just introduced, for tonight, maybe this is the most important person, because I turned on a very good show in the morning. Fox and friends. They treat us great. I just want fairness. What a great group. Ainsley and Steve, and by the way, Brian has gotten a lot better, right? And how good does Jessie Waters do? How good? Right? Just some really great people. And again, Tucker's been very good I have to say. He's been good. Smart. He's been great. Tucker, and the legendary Sean Hannity. Great. Number one. Number one show. Sean's got the number one show. And Laura Ingraham is knocking them out of the park, Laura. And you go over, Maria Bartiromo, and the great Lou Dobbs. How good are they? Lou Dobbs. And many more. And many more. How about Greg? Greg used to hate me. Now, he's good. Oh, we can't forget… We can't forget Judge Jeanine. I would be in such trouble if I forgot Judge Jeanine. No, these are… And there are many more. I just… Look, I'm just rattling some names off, but they're just terrific people. They're terrific people. But a man that I have to really say something very special about… 00 slot, because I'm out of there pretty good, and I see a handsome young man named Bob Kroll, Cops For Trump. And he's talking about this lousy mayor they've got. Now, he didn't quite say that, but I say it. He's talking about this lousy mayor that won't let the cops, the police, the law enforcement… My father always used to say, ""Son…"" And he meant it to. ""Never say cops. It's disrespectful. Say police officer."" I said, ""Okay Pop."" But honestly, the truth is with time, I love you guys whether you're cops, police officers, law enforcement. I'll call you whatever you want. It doesn't matter. You are so great, so respected. You don't even know how much our public loves you. You don't know it. You don't know it. You don't know it. But I see this guy, and I don't know if he's done a lot of television before, but he was very effective and very good. And he was saying how the police aren't being allowed to take care of this rally, and yet with President Obama and Bush and all these people, they were fine, fine. Everybody comes. They fall asleep at a rally. But they weren't allowed to do the job for us, and they went wild. So what I want to do… Go home to Mommy. Mommy says, ""I saw you on television tonight. I love Trump. Don't you ever do that again."" ""Yes Mom. Yes Mom."" But the job he did before the election, I came right here to Minnesota, and I pledged to address this really important issue, and it's the issue of law enforcement. And when I saw this man, this great gentleman on television pouring out his guts, pouring out his heart… I don't know him. He knows I've been good to law enforcement. He knows I've been good to, as my father would say, ""The police."" He knows I love the cops. He knows that, and so does everyone else. I mean, it's so many shirts, so many red shirts, and there are plenty of people here without the red shirts, and I want to just tell you, the respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound. It's unbound. Come up here. Bob, come up. Say something. Thank you fellas. I'll see you later. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great people. Thank you. What a group. I think your very weak mayor made a mistake when he took them on. As you know, for many years, leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers. I promised you that as president, I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy, and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls. And I've done that. Since coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%, and as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I kept another promise. I issued an executive action, making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state. So speak to your mayor. You should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods, and that's what you have the right to do right now. And believe me, no other president would be doing that. If Democrats were ever to seize power, they would open the floodgates to unvetted, uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before. Do you think you have it bad now? You would never have seen anything like what they want to do. But in the Trump administration, we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota. We've also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place. We are keeping terrorists, criminals and extremists the hell out of our country. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. The president of Mexico has been incredible. We have now, 27,000 Mexican soldiers. They're great, and they're tough, and they are now protecting our border, and those numbers have gone down like this. Thank you Mr. President. We will not make the mistakes made in European countries, that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country, on our shores. We're not going to allow it to happen. And as you all know, to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us, I instituted a very controversial, very hard to get, travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries. And the other day, one of the fake news reporters in the back said… They were talking about the travel ban, and they said, ""Well you know, the president has lost in court."" They said, ""Where?"" ""On the travel ban."" And he's right. I lost, and then I lost at the appellate division, and then I won at the United States Supreme Court. Right? And he knew that, but he said I lost on the… And he was right. I lost, and then I lost again, but then I won, and we have the travel ban. But instead of saying, ""He lost, and then he lost at the appellate, and then he won at the United States Supreme Court,"" he said, ""He lost on the travel ban."" These are very dishonest people. Do you understand that? Very dishonest people. In the Republican party, we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values, honor our history, and love our people. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities, and we're not letting it happen anymore. Republicans believe American cities should be sanctuaries for Americans, not for criminal aliens. My administration is taking historic action to secure the border. We have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May, and we are building the wall faster than anyone ever anticipated it could be built. And this is a serious wall. You've all seen it. It's going up rapidly, and you think that was easy? I had every Democrat in Congress fighting me, fighting me, fighting me. I had a lot of the rhinos fighting me. They say, ""See, he's not getting it built. He's not getting…"" Let me tell you. You have every Democrat fighting you. We took it from here, and we took it from there, and we took it from all over the place, and we got that thing. That's the biggest patchwork of financing you've ever seen, and that sucker is going up, and it is the finest, it is the strongest, it's largely 30 feet tall, which is the maximum height that they wanted. I went to the Border Patrol, and I sat down with 15 representatives of the Border Patrol, and I said, ""What do you want? What's your ideal?"" I actually said, ""I want to give you the Rolls Royce,"" and they killed me for that. They said, ""It's not an American made product."" Yeah, they happened to be right. No, they're right about that one. They're actually right there, Tom. But I said, ""I want to give you the Rolls Royce of walls. Tell me."" And they told me everything, and then we built some alternative walls. We built all different types. We built about seven of them, and then we had climbers come in. The one that worked the best was the one we're building. It also, unfortunately… The bad news, it's also the most expensive. But we got it for the right price. We got it for the right price. It's steel, it's hardened concrete, it's deep, it's high, it's a thing of beauty. And it's going to keep bad people out of our country. That's what it's going to do. And the Democrats knew this. Most of the Democrats four years ago, they wanted a wall. Now all of a sudden, they don't want a wall. You know why they don't want a wall? Because I want it. That's the only reason. And I just thought of it a year ago. I said, ""Man, this could've been so much easier."" All I had to do is say, ""We don't want a wall,"" and they would've given me all the financing I wanted for the wall. What was I thinking? We're not going to build a wall, and they would have forced me to build it. I would've… It's true. Under this administration, we are also ending the- … this administration. We are also ending the endless wars. We have to do it, folks. We have to do it. We have totally defeated the ISIS caliphate, and I did that in rather quick time if you remember, because we have the greatest fighting machine, now. When I came in and was totally depleted. We have great generals, we have great warfighters, and they did it so fast. I flew to Iraq, I met with the generals, right? I met with the generals. I said, ""I hear it's going to take a year to two years."" ""Sir, we can do it in two weeks."" I said, ""What?"" ""They don't let us fight, sir. They don't let us fight. We want to fight. They don't let us fight."" I said, ""I let you fight."" I said, ""How come if they say it's going to take anywhere from a year to two years, you say you can do it so quickly?"" He said, ""Sir, we're going to hit them from the front. We're going to hit them from the back. We're going to hit them from the sides, from underground, from overground. We going to hit the hell out of them."" And they did. And we won very quickly. But from now on, we want to fight where it is to the benefit of the United States of America, not to the benefit of other countries. And we will only fight to win. We're only going to fight to win. We don't fight to win. We don't fight to win. The Turks have been fighting with the Kurds for two centuries, and Turkey, as you know, is a NATO ally. But I've been rough on them. We've defeated 100% of that ISIS caliphate, and no longer have any troops in the area. We don't have any troops. The troops have been pulled out. Where Turkey is carrying out now a very tough campaign against the Kurds, get them out. So Turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the Kurds. We got along with the Kurds, and we helped the Kurds. And don't forget they're also fighting for their land. You know that. But they're fighting. So we have three choices. You're ready? Here are the three choices. We don't have any soldiers there because we've left. We won. We left. Take a victory, United States. We left. Take a victory, take a victory. Bring our troops back home. I told this story yesterday, I have to sign letters, it's the hardest thing I have to do. I sign letters, ""Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith from Arkansas. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jones from Alabama. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Somebody from some great state, I'm sorry to inform you, your son has been killed in combat. I'm so sorry."" And every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents, they're grieving, and they get together with other parents, and I don't want to see that it's like the same letter. So we do different letters. It's the hardest thing I have to do. Hardest thing.it's the hardest thing I have … I was telling Tom Cotton, it's the hardest thing that I have to do. And I sign those letters, and it just, it breaks your heart. And by the way, there's a time to fight. Nobody fights harder than I do. But there's a time, and there's not necessarily a time. But I send these letters out, quite a few. And sometimes I send letters out, it's called blue on green, where we're teaching people how to fight and then they turn the gun on our soldiers and shoot them in the back. And that's the hardest thing for a parent. I have all of them. I know everyone. That's the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification, because they learn how their child has died. When the so-called people that were teaching how to fight turn the gun on them, and shoot. We've had a lot of that, a lot of it in Afghanistan, more than we've ever had proportionately before. It's a horrible, horrible thing. But I have to sign these letters. And sometimes I go out to a place, Dover Air Force Base, it's a very tough experience. Mike Pence goes, I go, other people go, Tom Cotton goes. We go out there, and we meet the parents and the families, the wives, the children, the sisters, the brothers. We meet them, and we talked to them, and their son or daughter is being flown in from some far away place in a coffin, and these things are just impossible. I don't know how parents can do it, even. And I'll meet them. And we have a particular Colonel, that's all he does. So good. So professional. That's what he does. He said, ""I greet the dead, sir. I greet the dead."" And what happens is this big incredible machine flies in, this tremendous cargo plane, and it flies in so powerful, so big. I'll be talking to some of the parents, and they'll act like they're fine. I said, ""How are you doing?"" ""We're fine, sir. We're fine. We're really good."" I say, ""That's great."" And I'll tell the Colonel, I'll say, ""Colonel, I think they're doing great."" ""No sir, they're not going to do great. You'll see."" And I didn't know what he was talking about, this is the first time. Then we went outside to the runway, and this incredible machine is flying in, and it lands, and it comes over, and it pulls up, and we have military guards, we have incredible talented musicians that do this. That's what they do. What happens is that door opens up, and the Colonel told me, he said, ""Sir, when that door opens up, those same people that you think are okay, do things that you'll never see. You will hear sounds like you've never heard."" That's what he does. I saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it. The door was opened, and these beautiful soldiers, five or six on each side, lifting the coffin and walking down the runway, the plank, they call it, off this cargo plane. And I see parents make sounds, that were just 20 minutes ago absolutely fine, make sounds, scream and cry like you've never seen before. The Colonel was telling me that, ""Sir, you'll see things that you've never seen before. A mother who was fine 20 minutes ago, you think, breaking the military line and jumping off, and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter, jumping on, on top of the flowers, on top of the American flag."" I've seen this. Then I have all these people that want to stay. They want to stay. And I don't want to stay. We were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days. We've now been there for 10 years. We were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time. We're now going to be there for close to 19 years. It's time to bring them home. It's time to bring them home. It's true. Time to bring them home. We've done our job, we've defeated everyone that we're supposed to defeat. And now we are, we are policing, we are now policing. That's what we're doing. We're policing. And that, as I said, no more respect for the police, but these are military people, and those are police, but we are now policing. We're not fighting, we're policing. And you know what? After all of these years … One other story, and I have to tell you. I go to Walter Reed on Friday, and I do it quite often. I gave out five Purple Hearts. And I meet people that are so beautiful, so amazing. I met five warriors, and one was so badly hurt, with the loss of arms and a leg, another one … they're just very, very devastated. But these are great, great people. And I gave out the Purple Heart. And I see the parents, and I have to say, Walter Reed, I want to just say, the doctors there, the job they do, you know, you hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets, and the vets' care, and nobody's done better. We got choice for the vets. We did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible. But I saw these young men, and I gave them their Purple Hearts. And their parents were there crying. And one of them was so amazing. I said, ""What's your problem?"" ""Sir, my face was blown apart. My nose was absolutely just blown apart."" He said, ""Sir, it's incredible."" And I looked at him, I said, ""That's the most beautiful nose I've ever seen. What do you mean?"" He said, ""A doctor worked on my face for 10 hours in the field. He said there were a thousand fragments."" Now I don't know if that's right, but well, a lot. He meant a lot. ""He said there were a thousand fragments. He rebuilt my nose with glue. He glued the bones together. He rebuilt my nose."" I say, ""You have the most beautiful nose I've ever seen,"" and it's true. And his father came over to me, he said, ""Sir,"" father was crying, he said, ""Sir, honestly, my son looks better now."" He said, ""My son did not have a good look. He knows. Now look at it, it's beautiful, it's beautiful."" But these doctors at Walter Reed, and these Army, and Marine, and the medical doctors, they are unbelievably great people. And they see sights that you and I hopefully will never see. They see things that nobody will ever see, and there's nobody like them. And I have to give a shout out to those people, there's nobody like them. So in the case of Turkey, and Syria, and the Kurds, we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with Turkey. No, you don't want to do that. We could hit Turkey very hard financially. Or we could mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds. I like that. You know? Let's mediate a deal. But remember they've been fighting each other for hundreds of years, and we were artificially put there, in this case by President Obama. So we did our job. We knocked out. And I'll tell you another thing, we have to be treated fairly. We have to be treated fairly. We're not treated fairly by other nations. We captured many, many ISIS fighters. Most of them came from Europe. They came from Germany. They came from France. They came from all of these countries. And we called them, I called them myself in many cases, I said, ""Take your fighters."" They said, ""We don't want them. You take them."" I said, ""No, no, no, we did you a big favor. They're citizens of Germany. They're citizens of France. They're citizens of these various countries in Europe. Take your fighters."" ""We don't want them, sir. We don't want them.' And I said, ""How unfair are we treated? We do them a great favor, and they won't take the fighters."" So we're doing some things that are pretty amazing. Every once in a while you have to change course, and do what you have to do. The United States has spent $8 trillion in the Middle East. We've lost thousands of brave soldiers, and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people, great people, their lives will never be the same. These wars produced only chaos and bloodshed. And all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed, made the Middle East, really it's less safe, it's less stable, and it's less secure. And I say it all the time. The single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going in to the quicksand of the Middle East. We spent $8 trillion and lost thousands of lives. And by the way, the other side, we can talk about that, lost millions of lives. What did we do? So we're going to pull them out, and we're pulling people out, and we're trying to make good deals, and we're going to bring our soldiers back home, and we may need them for something else, and they'll be ready. Previous administrations lust for regime change, and also put historic Christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started. They are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless foreign adventures. The Christians, the Christians. And we work hard with the Christians. We have tremendous evangelical support. We work hard with the Christians. So we're slowly getting out of the Middle East. We're doing it carefully. And we're rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before. When I came into office, a very prominent general told me, because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone, said, ""Sir, we have no ammunition."" We had old planes. We had planes that were so old, they didn't fly. We had people going to the desert, the plane graveyards, airplane graveyards, picking up parts. I never want to hear a President of the United States hear those words again. I never want to have a President hear the words, ""Sir, we have no ammunition."" Think of that. Think of that. Now, thanks to more than two and a half trillion dollar worth of investment in our military, we have more ammunition, more missiles, more rockets, more tanks, more fighter jets, and more of everything else than we've ever had before. And we have no choice. You look around the world, and we have no choice, unfortunately. And the Democrats want to dismantle our military. After years of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country. That's what we have to do. We're replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA, a giant victory for our farmers, ranchers, workers in Minnesota. Congress should pass USMCA immediately. We hope that Nancy Pelosi can start thinking about passing some legislation instead of thinking about nonsense. And to protect our industrial backbone, I placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel. I'm also fighting back against years of chronic trade abuse from China. And the supply chain of China, which was unbreakable, is now breaking wide open. And they understand that. And I don't blame China for what's taken place over the last 25 years. I blame the people that led our country that let that happen, where hundreds of billions of dollars a year was taken from our country to build China. It's not China's fault. In the previous administration, they put our nation's natural resources under lock and key, including thousands and thousands of acres in a place called Superior National Forest. Last year, I traveled to Duluth and announced that we would be ending this injustice, reopening Superior National Forest, and restoring mineral exploration for the iron ore mines of Minnesota. Tremendous jobs. And now the iron range is back in business. The last time I was here, a man came up to me, he said, ""Sir, President Obama took our heart away, took our life away.' I'll never forget it. A man, strong guy, had tears in his eyes. He said, ""You gave us back our life,"" because they took it away from him. We gave it back. Best iron ore there is anywhere. My administration is also fighting the Democrat socialist healthcare agenda that would obliterate Medicare. Republicans will protect Medicare, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And for those of you that have private healthcare, health insurance, 180 million people, they are going to end it, obliterate it, and most people are thrilled with it. We are going to leave it. You're going to have your plan the way you want it. And there's no plan like those plans. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up to the moment of birth. That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant Washington corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it's the party of the American Dream. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. You remember that? Gee, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Now you have a President who's standing up for America, we are standing up for Minneapolis, and we are standing up for the great state of Minnesota. We begin this political campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America. We begin this campaign with right now almost three years of perhaps the most successful administration in the history of our country. Together, we will help millions more citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. With your help, we will reelect, and we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years. Nobody thought that could be done. Going to be done. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our great national motto, In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist in history. Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put a man on the face of the moon. Proud citizens like the people of Minnesota helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Minnesota, I will tell you this with great certainty, the best is yet to come. Thank you very much. And just in concluding, together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Minnesota. Thank you."
Trump,"Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you very much. That is a beautiful site right behind me, isn't it? That's a beautiful site. Thank you very much. And a very big hello, Wisconsin, we've been very good together. And I'm thrilled to be with thousands of loyal, hard-working American patriots. 47 days from now, we're going to win Wisconsin and we're going to win four more years in the White House. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I feel that way so strongly, so do you. Joe Biden devoted his entire career to offshoring Wisconsin jobs, outsourcing your factories, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless ridiculous foreign wars and surrendering your children's future to China. You know what he's been doing? I just see he's up there tonight getting softball questions from Anderson Cooper. They don't ask me questions like that. And the audience isn't quite like this. Do you see what his audience … they've got cars. They have car in a parking, it's the weirdest thing I've ever seen. And CNN is going, ""Oh, this is so beautiful."" It's not beautiful. They have cars in a parking lot. What a deal, I'll tell you, what a deal. Biden's supported every disasterous global sellout for half a century, including a NAFTA, China. You take a look at China's entry into the World Trade Organization and TPP. He supported them all, Biden, surrendered your jobs to China and you know that. I probably wouldn't be here if it weren't for that, it was one of the big things, one of the big reasons I decided to say to my great wife, our first lady, let's go have some fun. Let's go have some fun. She's done a great job and very popular. And the family is all over the place, all over the country. But unlike Joe, who lets you down when he'd never even came back to Milwaukee to apologize or just to pay respects, I came to Wisconsin and I've been here a lot since, since we started this, a lot. And you've been a tremendous beneficiary of what I've done and I have to, because you've been with me, you've supported me and we've had great victories together, all victories, so I want to thank you. Now Biden wants to surrender our country to the violent left-wing mob. You see what's happening. If Biden wins very simple, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchists, arsonists, and flag burners, they win and we're not into flag burners. We don't like flag burners. I'd like to say, pass a law, one year in jail, you started burning flags, we put you in jail for a year. We should do that. They would have done that, it's a different world, I guess, but it's sort of coming back to the way we have to have it because we're for law and order. They say, don't use that term, it's too tough. No, everybody wants law and order. Minorities want law and order. Everybody wants law and order. They have to have it. I'm running for the reelection and a very important reelection to bring jobs in factories back and that's a continuation. Because I don't know if you know it, the single greatest year Wisconsin has ever had was last year. The second best year that Wisconsin has ever had was the year before. And guess what the third was the year before that? And you're going to have your best year economically next year, it's all heading in that direction despite the pandemic given to us by China. We want to put the violent criminals behind bars and we have to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, not to other very terrible forces out there, because if we win, very simply America wins. And that's what we want, we want this great country to win. Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders. Fixed the disastrous trade deals, they have been the worst ever. Not even … it was not even … when I looked at these, I studied them and I used to talk about them, they had to be bad. When I started studying, I said, ""Who are the people that made these deals?""2 Grossly incompetent people. Brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt the awesome power of the U.S. military and obliterated the ISIS caliphate. We open obliterated it. Obama was not able to do it, he wasn't able to come close. It was just announced that in 2019, before the virus came in from China, we grew median income by a record of $4,400 in just one year, achieving the highest median income in U.S. history. That's in the history of our country. In the first three years, we lifted six point six million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any president in the history of our country. That's not bad. And I didn't even make these numbers up. These are numbers that … they sound good to me. We built the greatest economy in the history of a world. This is the greatest economy in the history of the world. And then the virus came in, we closed it down, we saved millions and millions of lives. We'd be at two and a half million, two million, three million. A number that would not be sustainable, would not be acceptable. A horrible number, there shouldn't have been one person that died. It should have been stopped at China. They stopped it for their country, but it came out to us, to Europe, to the rest of the world, 188 countries. We will deliver a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year. And it could be very, very soon. You've been seeing what's going … could be very, very soon. Could be, it's amazing how all of a sudden they hate the vaccine. When they thought it couldn't be done, they said, ""Well, he's got to get a vaccine."" And then all of a sudden, they're looking like it's going to be very close. We're doing great. We're doing great with vaccines and therapeutics, Remdesivir, all sorts of other things that are bringing the rates down, like at numbers that nobody can believe. But we have three vaccines right now, they're in the final stage, clinical trials. We worked it for the FDA where they approved it fast. They went very fast, very quick, at levels that nobody else could have ever achieved. No other administration, certainly the last one, because the last one was grossly incompetent. In fact, that's why I'm here, because if it was good, I wouldn't have run. If they did their job, I wouldn't have run. I was very happy in my other life. I was very happy, but I'm very happy in this life. More happy, because nobody has produced in three and a half years, the first three and a half years, nobody has done what we have been able to do, nobody. So we'll defeat the virus and next year will be truly, I think, from an economic standpoint and from other standpoints, maybe the best year of all. Hard to believe we're going so fast, the numbers have been incredible. We've had employment numbers, the best ever. We've had retail sales numbers the best ever. You see them all, they come out every day. And our stock market is for the most part, at a new high. And if people have 401ks, if you want to have your 401k go down like to depression levels, I think you should vote for sleepy Joe, because he's going to raise your interest. He'll be raising your interest rates. I watch him though, he's denying all this up. Everything that he said, he's now denying. He said, no fracking, right? There will be no fracking during the … he didn't know what fracking was, but he said there's no fracking. The reason is because everybody else, all of the radical left candidates up there, they couldn't get too far left, so Joe agreed. Then he gets the nomination, now they're all angry. You know that crazy Bernie, all of the left democrats, they don't want to vote for him anymore because he made promises and now all of a sudden he forgot that he said no fracking. He said, ""Well, now we can do some fracking."" But remember this in politics, it's always the thing that they say first, that's what they're going to do. No guns, no religion, no energy, no oil, remember that. Remember, he put Beto in charge of his gun policy, right? Beto, crazy Beto. Remember when Beto went out, he said, ""I was born for this."" And that's when it all came down. As soon as I heard that, anybody said they were born for this, that doesn't play well. But he's in charge of the Second Amendment. And you won't have a Second Amendment. Frankly, you wouldn't have a Second Amendment if I didn't get elected, it would have been obliterated. It would have been torn up. Maybe it would have been totally knocked out. But there's tremendous pressure on your Second Amendment. As long as I'm here, you'll always have a Second Amendment. But I want to just say, they do disinformation, they make up a phony story and then they go with it. They make up a totally phony story. It's called disinformation. And one of the things, oh, what they did, the worst of all was the soldiers. Because, nobody loves our soldiers like I do and they made up a phony deal. And that's why I say the gloves are off because when they do that, that's worse than what I'm going to talk to you about, that's big 10. You know we got it back, right? We got big 10. But the soldier story, about standing over their graves, you know the one I'm talking about, then they do a commercial. And I said, the good news about that is the gloves are off. I can now call him grossly incompetent, the man is incompetent. He's been there for 47 years, he didn't do a thing. Now all of a sudden, in years where he was never considered smart, but now he's really not considered smart. And now all of a sudden he's going to do what he never did in 47 years. He's got to do this and that and everything that I'm doing, everything that we're doing. But I want to congratulate the big 10 conference on yesterday's announcement that the fall season will start very soon. Oh, I hope your team does well after all that. I hope that team does well. But I especially want to thank a football legend, he was great. Wisconsin's own Barry Alvarez, he was great. Good, got to be careful when you do that, a lot of times you don't like people too much. They say, ""Oh,"" but he's a good man. We worked with him. We worked with a whole group, including the commissioner of the league, did a very, very good job, did a very good job. But we called them, and the reason is that they took an ad. In other words, another one, disinformation. They took an ad saying I was against football. I'm the one that said they shouldn't close. But I said that, if they close, they close. But then they took an ad saying I'm the one, I didn't want it. I wanted it closed. So then I said, ""Well, no, I don't. I want it open. Let me call up the commissioner."" We called up the commissioner and he was great. He said, ""You really think so?"" And bottom line, we worked very hard, lots of calls to lots of different states, lots of people. We dealt with the players, the parents of the players, who are really the boss, that's okay, I won't say that. But these are players that have a shot at the NFL. They have a shot at pro-football. We want the NFL to proudly stand when they sing our National Anthem. Or their ratings are going to continue to go down like they did last weekend, down 27%. Because people don't want that. You know what, we have enough politics, right? We have politics here. We have politics all over. In fact, sometimes I have to turn it off. I can't do it anymore. I can't watch me. It's always … I can't watch me. I can't watch. But no, we have enough politics. We don't want to watch now on Sunday, all, here we go again with the politics, let them play football, let them stand and salute or put your hand on your heart and be proud of our country and be proud of our great American flag. And then go home to the mansion and have a good time. Take a nice sauna and then if you want, after you recover, you come out and you go and you do your thing, whatever the thing may be. But people don't want to see it and the ratings are down. Here we go again. I thought we taught them that lesson two years ago. Didn't we think? I thought we taught that lesson. But Biden would absolutely eradicate your state's economy. I know this state very well. It's one of the reasons I made the great deal with Canada and Mexico, but Canada, because they were taking advantage of you so badly on your dairy products. You had a 287% tariff on your dairy products with Canada. People don't realize Canada is one of the toughest negotiators and they treated your state and this country very unfairly until I came along, very, very unfairly. Did you know that? 287. But I saw some farmers and this was like the straw that broke the camel's back. They had something called specialty milk. Does anybody know what that is? Right, you know. A lot of people … it's a small little grouping of milks, specialty milk. But this was the final straw. And I met some people and Canada finally did it to them like they did it to everybody else. And they raised a tariffs massively, they made it impossible. They tried to take over that business too, along with all of them, it was just massive and horrible what they did. And that really got me going, the little specialty milk, specialty products, a small portion, but you know what, that was it. And we have a great deal. The USMCA is a great deal and I'm very honored to have done it. But it was all because of specialty milk and the way you were taken advantage of by Canada. You know, they have the wonderful, Oh, Canada, we love to hear the song, right? But let me tell you, they are very tough. And they've taken advantage of our country for many, many years. And I will tell you this, they're not so happy now, but at least they got a deal, but you're happy. And it's about time you were happy. You now have a great deal and you're not going to have your companies leaving for Mexico anymore or Canada. And you're not going to have them make your product in Mexico or Canada, send it over here with no tariff, with no tax. Where we lose tax, we lose jobs, we lose our companies, we lose everything. And they make a lot of money selling the product to us, same product. So we're not doing that stuff anymore. There's a tremendous disincentive, it's called, like, let's not do it. And you haven't seen that lately. You haven't seen too many companies leaving have you? It's sort of an amazing thing. It's a little bit like what we did with the statues. So on the statutes, they were knocking them down three or four months ago. I said, ""Do we have any laws? No, but there was a very old law."" I said, ""What was it?"" You get 10 years in jail, 10 years in prison, they actually use the word prison, which is a tough word. You get 10 years in prison if you knocked down a statue or a monument. I said, ""Let me see that law, I want to see that law."" Right, Glen, right? I want to see that law. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. So big tax cuts, big regulation cuts. The Democrats, they want to … the Democrats, they want to just really break us down in terms of our competitive ability to compete with other nations. Do you notice what's happening with Japan? You notice what's … We have taken billions and billions of dollars in from China. We charge them a fortune. In fact, many farmers in this group, because you got to love Trump. I gave you $28 billion, right? Thank you very much, China, right? You were targeted. 12 billion, Sonny Purdue, Secretary of Agriculture. I said, ""Sonny, how much have they been hit for, targeted for?"" Remember when China said we're not going to do anything, we're not buying. They thought they were going to put pressure on us. Sonny said, ""Sir, 12 billion, the year before last and last year was 16, total of 28 billion."" We took 28 billion out of the tariffs. China never paid us 25 cents, not 25 cents with Obama and Biden. And in all fairness with no president, they paid us nothing. They pay us now tens of billions of dollars. I took a small portion of it, I added it up, 16 and 12, 28, and I said, $28 billion is going to the farmers. Did everybody get that money, right? You had a very good year, the farmers have had a very good year. Last week, China ordered and you have to understand, I view China differently now than I did six months ago, we made a great trade deal but I view it differently because I don't know if I can ever view it the same. But last week they know how I feel and they're very smart. So instead of saying, we're not going to do business, which would have been okay with me. We would have worked it out somehow, you would have been very successful, the farmers. But last week, they had the largest order of corn. Did you know this? In the history of our country. Did anyone know this, the farmers? From China, thank you very much. The largest order of soybeans in the history of our country. And one of the largest cattle orders in the history of our country, because they're very smart. Somebody else would have said, well, let's not do business. And then it would have been easy for me, but they gave us so much. I have every farmer calling up saying, please do me a favor. We love this. We love this. This is a great deal. It's a great deal, but we feel differently about it, don't we? We just feel differently about it. I don't talk about it like I used to, I talked about it, it was great. And it turned out to be a great deal, but I don't talk about it the same way. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas for the future than these two parties, you got law and order on one side and you have chaos on the other. On November 3rd, Wisconsin will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we will allow Biden and the Democrats to impose a four trillion dollar tax hike, ban American energy, confiscate your guns, which is what they want to do. Shut down the economy, destroy the suburbs. You know they were destroying our suburbs, you know that, right? I don't know, if somebody said, you just doing okay in the suburbs? I said, ""How can I do okay, I saved the suburbs. What I've done is saved the suburbs."" And you know this, I don't have to go into it, but I saved the suburbs. I think the suburbs … Last time, four years ago, ""Oh, he's not going to do well with women."" I did great with women. They said, ""Well a big thing."" Remember that?. No, but was that one of the greatest evenings ever, remember? And remember all the fake news, look at all the … Oh la, that's a lot. That's a lot of people back there. Look at that, the red lights are on. Don't worry, I won't say anything bad about you CNN. Because as soon as I see, as soon as I- Because as soon as I see … As soon as I'm getting ready to say something about fake news, et cetera, et cetera, the lights start going off so I'm not going to … One just went off I think. You can tell by the lights, they got that little beautiful red light. You see it? But I won't say anything bad about them but they are fakers and do you remember when they … Remember when they were saying that the polls are terrible. Actually these polls are very good compared … That was so bad it was like why did anybody vote. They're called suppression polls. They make them so bad that you lose all your appetite, you lose all your spirit, they take your guts out, and you don't go and vote, and your wife looks at you and says, ""Darling I love that guy, but he's not going to win. He doesn't have a chance because the polls, he's down 10, he's down 20, he's down 50 points, darling. He can't possibly win. Let's go have dinner and then we'll come home and watch his concession speech."" But my people didn't buy that because my people went out to vote. Instead, we watched her concession speech. Crooked Hillary, that was a real piece of work. Remember when she was saying, ""Will you accept the decision of the voters? Will you accept that decision?"" I wasn't perfect, I said I'll see how it works out. I should have said, ""Yes, I will,"" but I couldn't do that because I know how crooked she is. Would you accept the decision? The anchor said to me like, ""Will you accept?"" They're coming after me, I said, ""You're supposed to be going after her a little bit too."" Did you ever see debates where you had all of the anchors plus the candidates against me? Here we sit, is that Air Force One, yes, that's Air Force One. How did that happen? A lot of the times I'd say to the anchor, I'd say, ""Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This isn't fair."" I mean I'm watching what they're doing with Biden where he's using teleprompters, ""Move it up, move it up, I can't see, I can't see."" He's shot. He's shot. President Xi of China is not shot. Putin is not shot. Kim Jong-un, remember we're supposed to be in a war with him, what happened to the war? No, it seems to be good. Did you see the Middle East two days ago? Remember our incompetent negotiator John Kerry? He never got up to walk. The guy's getting beaten on every point, I say, ""Walk. Walk. Get up and leave the table. You're giving up."" They'd say, ""We want this."" He'd say, ""Well, I'd rather not."" ""We want this."" ""Okay, you got it."" ""We want that."" ""You got it."" ""We want that."" Say no and walk. They'll probably possibly call you back and if they don't that's okay too. But right now I will tell you Iran, if we win, Iran will be calling us within the first week, they're dying to make a deal. GDP down 27%. They don't have too much money for terror anymore, it's actually amazing, do you notice what's going on? Now I don't want to speak too loud, but I did put out on social media the other day that if they hit us in any way, any form, written instructions already done, we're going to hit them 1000 times harder than we've ever hit them before. So hopefully they will just come and we'll make a deal and they'll go back to being a rich country, let them go back and be rich but they cannot have a nuclear weapon. They cannot. That deal was so bad that Obama made. $150 billion, they got $150 billion for nothing. You know the deal is practically … If I didn't terminate it which I'm proud to have done, but if I didn't terminate it, they got $1.8 billion in cash, how about that? If I didn't terminate that stupid deal, first of all you wouldn't have the deal in the Middle East and all these countries are joining, it's happening fast. They want to all join. We did it, you know, the reverse. We did it the … Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You know it's interesting, thank you very much. I knew I like you. So the Nobel Peace Prize. So the funny thing, a lot of people don't know because the fake news doesn't write about it. So if you're a president, right? And you are nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, you're the United States, no, but think of this. That's a big deal. I mean Obama got it like in his first couple of weeks and nobody knew why he got it including him, remember? He couldn't tell you why. He had no idea. To this day, he has no idea why he got it. But if you're a president and you get nominated, then two days later, you get nominated, did you know this, a second time, for a different deal. Kosovo. Serbia. They've been killing each other for hundreds of years. I stopped a lot of death and I did it like easy, it wasn't hard for me. It's sort of a natural thing to do but we did a good thing. But you know what? They did a check. So I got nominated twice for the Nobel Peace Prize, that's a big deal, I don't know. I should have gotten nominated seven times because we did a lot of other things, but these are for two different deals, and not one mention was made on the evening news. Think of it. I got rid of the prosecutor, here's the billion, right? But they don't want to play that too often. You have to look around for it. It's a very unfair deal but as the expression goes, we won, I don't know how the hell we did it. When you look at the opposition, when you look at how unfair it is and these guys know very well, you look at how unfair it is, it's pretty damn good, but we have a lot of support. We have tremendous support of the people. These rallies, look at this rally. These rallies … These rallies are incredible gap ever polled. I'm not a believer in the polls but I believe that one. It's the biggest enthusiasm gap, he's got no enthusiasm. The only enthusiasm is for the people that want to beat us, they want to beat me. That's the only thing he's got, the people that want to … They couldn't care less about him. He could be that piece of wood that was left in the ground. Biden will hand the left wing mob the keys to your kids' classroom. Earlier today I took a historic stand against the hateful lies being fed to America's youth, the parents know all about it. I checked, they're doing it in Wisconsin too. I was a little surprised, I'm a little surprised. I'm a little surprised you let it happen actually but we're going to get rid of it. I announced that we're launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We're going to teach our children the truth about America, that we're the most exceptional nation ever to exist and we're getting better every single day. Sleepy Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the far left. He even opposed sending the National Guard into a place called Kenosha, did you ever hear of Kenosha? How about that, did we do a good job? I wish we did it a little sooner but we finally got your governor's okay. We have to do that if … We got to get the governors to say please do it. How they don't do it, how they don't do it in some other places when you look at what's going on with Chicago, right? When you look at what's going on with Portland, those are just anarchists. You know how long it would take us to fix up Portland in terms of ending it all? I'd say far less than an hour, I'd say a half hour. Look what we did at Minneapolis. We're doing well in Minnesota because they saw what happened. Now they shouldn't have allowed it to go on for 11 days, they should have called us immediately but do you remember that beautiful night? Nice evening, a little problem, there were a lot of buildings in the background that were burning down to the ground as reporters said, ""No, this is a peaceful protest."" I don't know if it's your state but a couple of them they have … You're allowed to protest, so you can't go to church but you can rip the hell out of the streets, of Main Street, of 5th Avenue, break up the stores. Burn down the buildings. Climb over each other's face, you can climb right over their face. You don't have to wear masks, you don't have to do anything. 25,000 people walking down the street, looters, anarchists, agitators, burning down stores, throwing things at police. They've taken the authority away from our police, our great police. They've taken their authority and their dignity away. We're giving it back, we have to, we have to. By the way, I was endorsed by New York's finest and we're with them all the way. I was just endorsed two days ago by Chicago Police. I think that takes courage, right? Philadelphia, Florida, Texas, everybody, Ohio. I don't know, did anybody … Is there one group of … Even if it was a tiny little group of two or three police, did anybody endorse Sleepy Joe? I don't think so. But we did a great job in Kenosha. We got out there, I went there as you know, a little while ago but had we not gone in that place would … It would have been burned to the ground. They did damage, we should have gone in. I wanted to go in the first night, we would have stopped it immediately but it was a great outcome as was in Minnesota. Again, if they would have called us early it would have been over. Portland, I'd love to go there. That would be so easy. You know in Seattle, they heard we were coming in, they gave up. They heard we … I said, ""That's enough. We're going in. I don't care. We're going in."" ""Do you have permission."" ""No, we're going in."" They took over a chunk of the city, and when they heard we were going in it's like, ""Well we give up, that's it."" That was the end of the Settle problem. It's a terrible thing that's going on. All in Democratic run, super liberal run, cities. The red cities are doing great. I think we're doing great all over, the Republican cities, we're fair. We're not stupid. How stupid these people are. Did you see Chicago? 48 people shot, six died. You know we're in Afghanistan, we're pulling the troops, you know that, we're coming back, we're almost finished. We're pulling … Finally, these endless wars. These endless wars, and we had to fight other things but we've done a great job but we're acting like a police force over there. No, we're pulling the troops, we're almost out of Iraq. That's another one, we're down to about 2,000 troops, did you know that Sean? 2,000 troops. So Syria, we're out but we kept the oil so we have some … Was it okay that we at least kept the oil? I feel badly because we have some troops … ""Well you haven't pulled the troops."" No no, we're gone, we pulled all the troops out of Syria. Remember we were supposed to be guarding the border between Syria and Turkey? I said, ""Why are we doing that?"" They said, ""Well, we are."" I said, ""Wait a minute, we have an army of 100,000 here, an army of 25,000, 30,000 here. We got 5,000 soldiers. That's a very dangerous position to be in."" I don't like it. They've been guarding their own borders with different names for a thousand years. Why the hell do we have to be over there guarding their border? We want to guard our own borders, right, where we're doing very well. Where we're doing very well. We're doing great on our southern border, I hate to say this, but that wall is going up very rapidly, 10 miles a week. We're up to 330 miles and the wall will be finished very soon. You think that was easy, that was not easy, our great congressman over here, that was not easy. The Democrats were totally in favor of the wall until I said when I came in, ""We will build the wall."" As soon as I said it, they were against the wall. They said, ""We don't want you to build the wall. Walls don't work."" I said, ""No no, walls always work."" You know what else works? The wheel. The wheel and the wall, you can go back. Come back in 1,000 years from now. The only two things I know for sure, you're going to have a wheel and you're going to have a wall. The computers, they come up with a brand new computer, it's genius, 12 days later, it's obsolete. But walls are never obsolete, neither are wheels. So I made one mistake and I tell this to these guys because they were great warriors for me, the congressmen. They were incredible actually. I tell it to them. I should have said instead of we will build the wall, we will build the wall, we will build … Then the Democrats held us up and fought us and sued us and everything else and now we won so many lawsuits on the wall and we had the military money, I can build like 10 walls with all the money we have. It's the craziest thing. Maybe we'll build it double thick or we'll go twice as high. No, but the wall is great. Everything, everything, that they wanted, but I made one mistake. I should have said, ""We will not build a wall."" Then they would have insisted that we build it, I could have saved two years of litigation. ""We will not build a wall under any circumstances."" Then Pelosi would say, ""We demand that you build a wall."" These people are terrible. Crazy Nancy, crazy as a bedbug. She's crazy as a bedbug. She decided to make a nice little stop-in at the beauty parlor, how did that work out? Not too good, it didn't work out too well. Can you imagine? The owner of the beauty parlor is a MAGA lady, she loves Trump. Can you believe it? I don't know what it is but I think if I owned a beauty parlor, I had a customer, I'm not sure I'd be turning her in. The owner turned Nancy in. That's a lot of hate. That's serious hate, right? No, she's a great owner. As far as I'm concerned, I think she's fantastic. She's for us. They said, ""What made you do it?"" You know what she said, ""Because I see how hard our president has to work. I see what they put him through. I see what he puts with and I turned her in."" How about that? How about that? We love her. She can do my hair anytime. I think I'm going to call her in. Check it out, maybe you can do something. Maybe you can improve it, it's not bad though. I have friends that … I have friends my age, they're not looking too good. Instead of standing up for America, Joe Biden and the Democrats, they condemn America and war is always waged on our great law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. Kamala Harris, that's another great beauty, Kamala Harris, that's a beauty. Remember, I tell this story all the time. When you pick somebody, you pick somebody that's hot, that's going in the right direction, right? She came out, she was at like 14, 15 in the polls, and she started going down, down, down, it never stopped. It drove her crazy. She was terrible at the debates. Wait till you see what … I don't want to put pressure on him but wait till you see what Mike Pence does to her in the debates, but I don't want to put … I don't want to put pressure on Mike. Do we have a great vice president? Is he good? He's great, and he loves this state. Loves all the states actually. He's just a great American but do you remember his last debate? What he did to that character from Virginia? That one wasn't good. The other guy's jumping around, Mike is just sitting there, we love America, we're going to lower your taxes. Thank you, you win. No, Mike is great. But Kamala Harris and 13 members of Biden's staff urged their supporters to donate to a fund to bail out rioters, take them out of jail, get them out of jail as soon as possible. Including one who attempted to murder a police officer, a man who was accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl. This is what we're dealing with. This is what we're dealing with. You know Kamala was considered, is considered further left than Crazy Bernie, think of that. They got there … I mean seriously, watch. You know the manifesto that Biden and … It's not Biden, Biden has not agreed to anything. His people, his representatives, because Biden doesn't know he's alive, let's not kid ourselves. Biden. Biden didn't agree, he didn't, they just told him what's happening. They said, ""Listen, you're against fracking but now you have to be in favor of fracking because you lucked out. Elizabeth Warren decided not to drop out and when she stayed,"" Pocahontas, you know Pocahontas? Did anybody ever hear of her? She's another great one. Pocahontas. I said to her a long time ago, I've got more Indian blood in me than you do and I have none, I have none. Sadly. I'd love a little bit of it, but I have none, I said … I turned out to be right. She choked and she went for a blood test. Remember? Was it 1024th? Meaning maybe nine hundred years ago, there was a little action going on. Crazy Pocahontas, she's a nasty one though, isn't she? She's a terrible person. I was hoping that she'd win so we could go after her because I think Kamala is not as smart but she's a little bit less vicious. I think this. The one who treated Sleepy Joe the worst was Kamala. She accused him of MeToo, she accused him of everything. She accused him of … That he was a racist, right? That he was a racist? Because what he's done to the black population of this country was a terrible thing. She's accused him of everything under the book, the busing, remember, the busing scandal. So I said brilliantly he'll never pick her because she was too terrible to him. She was the worst of everybody. By far, I would say, but she picked him and hopefully that's going to be history, it's not going to matter, and that is no way for a woman to become the first president, that's for sure. If a woman is going to become the first president of the United States, it can't be her. That would rip our country apart. This is not what people want and she comes in through the backdoor, this would not be what people want, especially because it's her. Biden has called to end cash bail, you know that right, for vicious criminals? Meaning if you assault a copy or anybody else, you're right back on the street the next day. He called for police and he calls them all the time the enemy. He says they're the enemy and he just thinks it's terrible. He think it's terrible. Now he's liking the police much more. It's a little late. Remember, first instinct, that's where they're going, and he has no choice because he has to, because again, I was going to say, the radical left hates him because they think he deceived them because they agreed on that manifesto and that manifesto is seriously a leftist dream and he agreed from the Green New Deal, getting rid of your planes. No more airplane trips. Remember the crazy senator from Hawaii? ""Do you like the Green New Deal?"" ""I love it very much,"" he said. Oh okay, well you're the senator from Hawaii, that's right, the beautiful island of Hawaii. She said, ""Under the Green New Deal you basically can't fly in an airplane."" ""Oh that's a problem."" So they said they'd build a bridge from the mainland to Hawaii. It's 2,000 miles long but these are minor details. Remember her when they explained to her that planes are out, cows are out. Cows, they don't want cattle, they don't want cows. Did they withdraw that one? That was a tough one, wasn't it? They don't want cows, bad for the ozone layer. Who would even think of that? You'd got to be sick to even think it, okay? Give me a break. Give me a break and I guess under that theory this big guy is next, he's next. No, it's a sick deal going on there. To do it the way they want would cost $100 trillion. That's more money than this country could earn in 1,000 years to do it right. "" We don't like that building, the windows are too large."" ""Okay, let's rip it down and build a new one."" What windows are you going to have? You're not going to have windows anymore. Environmental. They love wind too, right? The big windmills, I always say, the greatest graveyard in the world for birds, just walk under a windmill. You will see more dead birds than you will ever imagine, what's happening, including eagles. You know, in California they put you in jail if you shoot a bald eagle, right? You go to jail, right? These windmills are knocking them out of the sky all day long. It's unbelievable, and yet they want wind, and wind also is very, it's very hard to store the electricity from wind. So if you go home and you want to watch television because President Trump is on and you want to watch one of his very brilliant State of the Union addresses, if the wind isn't blowing, the husband looks at the wife, says, ""Darling, I'm sorry, you can't watch tonight. The wind is not blowing."" ""Sorry, you can't watch tonight. The wind is not blowing."" And she looks at me, ""I like the old days. It's much better."" But the rhetoric of Biden and the radical left puts your law enforcement in serious danger. Last weekend, two Los Angeles sheriff's deputies were ambushed and shot at point blank range. And we have everybody looking for that creep that did it. I called him an animal the other night. I said, ""He's an animal,"" and we were challenged by some people on the left. ""He's not an animal. He's a human being."" He's not a human being. They got to find him. They got to find him. And the penalty has to be very fast, very swift and very, very severe. You can't do that. We call for the death penalty if you kill a policeman. You know that, right? But the anti police demonstrators, they cheered and cheered when they saw this. And then they tried to stop them from even getting into the hospital. As president, I'll always support the heroes of law enforcement and I'll fight to ensure that criminals who murder police officers do indeed get the death penalty. They want prisoners to vote too, they wanted to. I said, ""So what about the Boston bomber?"" Remember Bernie Sanders? He wanted all prisoners to have. And I said, ""Does that mean everybody?"" ""Yes."" So we sent in a question, ""Does that include the Boston bomber? Is he entitled to a vote?"" And even Bernie is going, ""Oh man, let's get into a different question. This is not a good question."" But we want to get that, we want to take care of it. If you look at all of the problems that we have, you look at crime, even somebody brought it up today, we're doing a great job relative to other countries on the coronavirus. You know how many names we have? Like 22 different names. I call it the China virus. We're doing a great job. But if you want to really see a great job, take New York and some of these other Democrat run states out of it. You'll see numbers that are unbelievable because New York had a very, very hard time. A lot of bad things happened. But you take a few of the states out and you'll really see numbers. But by comparison to other countries and by almost all metrics, we've done an incredible job, including the job of helping the world with ventilators and all of the things that we built. And I think our task force has been incredible. And Mike Pence has done a great job. Biden opposes the death penalty for cop killers or mass murderers. Biden says he wants to protect black lives, but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of African American citizens. The Democrat party's war on cops has already led to surging homicides in Democrat controlled cities. Yet Biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide. They ask him, ""What about nationwide? What about the fact that you just had your Democrat national convention?"" Where, by the way, we had far many more viewers, millions and millions of more viewers. We had millions of more. I thought it was a great thing. Did anybody hear Herschel Walker that night? It was … well. You talk about a good football player. He was some player. What a great guy. But all of them, everybody. The first lady did great, Ivanka did great. They all did, they did great. We had some … and some incredible stories, some very sad stories when you look and see what happened. But Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest the domestic terrorists. Joe Biden is a weak person. He's always been a weak person. And that was in prime time. And prime time was 25 years ago. And let me tell you, he's not old. I always defend him on this. I have friends that are 85, 89, 92, 95, and they're 100%. There's just something wrong with Joe. He's off, okay? He's off, and I have no problem saying it anymore when I watch the disinformation, because this is not disinformation. This is fact. If he's elected, his radical supporters won't just be causing mayhem on the streets, they'll be running the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Education. And most importantly, they will put many judges on the United States Supreme Court. We can't have that. We'll have a totally different country; radical left judges. And that has to do with the Second Amendment. It has to do with right to life, it has to do with so many different things that will turn your world upside down. And they'll have one, two, three or four, whoever is the next president. And hopefully, that's going to be us. Not me, us. It's us. But I put it, and think of this, by the end of the term, we'll have approximately 300 brand new, great federal judges, Court of Appeals judges 300, which is a record, 300. Give or take a little, tiny bit, but 300. Nobody thought that was possible. I want to thank President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Nobody gets left one opening. A federal judgeship is a big deal. Nobody gets left any openings. He gave us 142 openings. Thank you very much. What happened? They thought Hillary was going to win, so they didn't push it. And then they said, ""Wait a minute, these polls are getting a little close at the end."" And they tried like hell to get some judges approved, but it didn't work. That's what happens. You got to go and you have to act fast. You got to get it done. Get it done, right? We get things done like nobody's ever gotten it. Oh, he was a great president. He was great. He left 142 judges for the Republicans. He was a great president, right? If you are of that side of the plate of that ideology, and you had a president that left you 142 federal judgeships, I don't think you'd rate him as doing a good job. Hey, look at what happened in Iraq, look at what happened with ISIS, look at what happened with our military, look at what happened with our vets. Our vets are better taken care of now than they've ever been in the history of our country, but never forget they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. And that's true. That's true. And we're winning the fight and we're winning this election. This election, we are doing well. They refuse to say it. They refuse to say it, and they hate to say it. It just drives them crazy. But that night, remember they started off by saying, ""This will be a very short evening for Donald Trump."" That was Donald Trump in those days. Now, it's President Trump. I lost all my friends because of this position. I had friends. ""Hey, Don, let's go to dinner."" ""Okay. Good, Richard. I'll go."" Hey, Don, let's go."" ""Okay, Larry. I'll see you later. I'll meet you at a restaurant in New York."" Everybody was nice and loose. You could have a great conversation, and you don't want to know what we talked about. It's just none of your business, but we were loose. All of a sudden, I'd become president of the United States. And these are a lot of … I know a lot of important people. Actually, the people I like the best are the people that are less successful because it makes you feel so powerful. I always say, never go out with a successful person. You'll understand. But I know a lot of very successful people, very, very successful. And now they call me up, ""Mr. President, sir, would you like to get together sometime?"" I say, ""Loosen up. Yes, call me Donald. You've known me for 30 years, call me Donald."" ""Oh, thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. President, I appreciate it."" I lost all my friends because it's respect for the office, let's face it. It's different. They used to be loose, they used to be great. You could sit back, I'm not a drinker, but you could sit back and have a drink, whatever the hell you're drinking. And now, you can't do that anymore. You can't do it anymore. So I have to rely on people in Congress to be my friends. And we just happened to have a couple tonight. And one of them who's been a great warrior and he's doing a fantastic job, I just saw you on television by the way, Bryan. Does everybody know Bryan Steil? Bryan Steil; young, handsome, but a warrior. When the fake impeachment happened, it was a total fake, what did we finish up with the Republicans? 197 to nothing, right at the house. One night, it was a fake impeachment. I got impeached over a perfect phone call of congratulations to the president of Ukraine, who I never met before. If you're going to do something, at least know him a little bit, right? I never met him. And then they said it was eight times, quid pro quo. That was Adam Schiff. Shifty Schiff, right? And he went before Congress and he repeated my conversation, except that he made it all up. Remember he repeated it? And then I said, ""Ah, fortunately, we had that whole thing essentially recorded."" I'm glad I did, but these are very deceptive, deceiving, sick people. And I said, ""Well, he lied because there was no quid pro quo."" It was a perfect conversation. But by that time it was too late because they had already embarrassed themselves by doing it. And Nancy Pelosi was all set. She loved doing it, she from day one, but she thought it was what Schiff said. When she saw the conversation, she said to her people, ""What the hell did you get me into?"" So they could have dropped it, but they said, ""Let's give it a shot."" He's another beauty, Mitt Romney. He's a real beauty. He couldn't get elected dog catcher right now in Utah. So we have another great one and he's really a friend of mine, and he's been solid. He loves his country and he loves his state, Glenn Grothman. Glenn, thank you very much, friend. And a man who just got elected, and he's from an area that I know very well, we did very well, we got our big, big, fat, beautiful contract that produced lots of jobs. But he was taking a legend's place, so it's never easy to replace a legend. That's Duffy, in case anybody … And they was running and we did a lot of work for him, and it was great. And he reacted very well under pressure. A lot of people don't react well under pressure. They choke, they choke. He was under a lot of pressure and he ended up winning by like 18 points. And now, he's your congressman. He's doing a great job. You got to vote for all these people on November 3rd, Tom Tiffany. Thank you, Tom. And we have a great congressional candidate, Derrick Van Orden. Where's Derrick? Derrick, good luck. I hear good things, Derrick. You got my total support. I hear very good things. I could only be supportive. Our record is like 222 and three, so I don't like to have a loss. And I support you a 100%, you know that. You have my total endorsement, all right? I hear you're fantastic. All right. And your former congressman who I hope is making a lot of money in the private sector because he deserves it, especially his wife, Rachel deserves it, she's just fantastic. He's fantastic because I know he's coming back into government in some form. He can come with us. He can stay here. He can maybe run for governor or maybe do something, Sean Duffy. Sean Duffy. No, but he was the World Champion tree climber. And I love sports, right? Anytime you know the world champion at anything, but especially that, and I'll never forget. I was asking about it. ""How was it was?"" He said, well, he broke his back numerous times. He broke a lot of bones. I said, ""Let me ask you a question. How much harder was it to go up the tree than down?"" He said, ""It was easy going up."" The hard part was coming down because if he missed, that was where the danger was, right? That was where the danger. But many times, world champion. Could you still do it today? ""A little bit heavier,"" he said. You got to carry a little bit more weight. That's all right. That's not a good sign though, right? Anyway, great job. We love having you Rachel, thank you very much. You are a friend. Fox and friends, and plenty of other places, right? A lot of personality, a lot of personality. Rachel, she's been our friend from day one, I think from day one. And her fantastic family too. Tonight, we're also praying for everyone in the path of Hurricane Sally. We're out there working very hard. We are working in Florida and Alabama and Georgia. We have FEMA. We have everybody there. We just finished in … take a look, we just went to Louisiana, Texas. We're getting hit by some big hurricanes, but we have it under control. Really good. Our coast guard has been fantastic, by the way. Unbelievable, the bravery. They go into these storms. They go into these storms. They say, ""How dangerous is it?"" ""Sir, it's very dangerous."" I say, ""Yeah. All right."" He said, ""Would you like to try it sometime?"" I say, ""Admiral, no, thank you. I'll take a pass."" I think they might have a problem with me doing it, but I will tell you, they are … In Texas, they saved 16,000 people two years ago, the coast guard, US Coast Guard. I think there's no brand to me, that's gone up more than the US Coast Guard. So it's great that we're getting them new ships. Those ships are all coming in. Nice new ones, all built in the USA, beautiful ones. Most of them have already arrived. My administration will be by their side through every step. We're working again, very, very hard in the Panhandle. The Panhandle, we love the Panhandle. It got hit hard. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. We passed record tax cuts and regulation cuts. Nobody's ever done more, more than anybody else has ever done to keep our family farms in the family. We've virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax. So if you die in 100 years from now, and you have children who you love as opposed to children that you can stand … is anybody here they have children that they don't like, or perhaps can't stand? Because if you do, don't listen to the rest of this. But if you have a family that you love and you have a small business or farm or whatever, they were being put out of business. They'd have to go and borrow the money to pay the estate tax, the death tax. And it was a terrible thing. We got rid of it, so now you can leave your farm, your small business to your family. And just hope they remember you every once in a while. It's always a difficult situation, but it was. It was ruining farms. They'd have to go out and sell the farm, they'd have to go out and get partnerships, they'd have to go out and borrow money from banks. And then all of a sudden they're in foreclosure proceedings and they've never done that before. They don't have to worry about that anymore. If you love your family, that's a big deal. They've been trying to get that, Sean, for what, 30 years they've been trying to get that, right? Especially for the farmers, because it's that kind of a business. It's a great business, but it's day to day. You have a bad crop, all of a sudden you can't pay interest on a loan to pay your state tax, right? And they lose their farm. So we're not going to have that anymore. We achieved American energy independence for the first time. Totally independent. We don't have to be in those far away places unless we want to be. Biden pledged to abolish American oil, American jail, clean coal, natural gas. He said the fracking, I told you that, but we're not going to let him get away. We'll be bringing that up on occasion. For 47 years, Joe Biden crushed the dreams of Wisconsin workers and enriched foreign countries. That's what happened. Before I got here, what was happening with Japan? And we pay our deep respects to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a great friend of all of ours, a great friend of mine. He's going to be leaving office very soon, like in a matter of a day. And he was a great gentleman. He's a tough negotiator, I'll tell you that. He made very good deals against the United States, but he's somebody that's going to be missed. He's a great gentleman. He championed every special interest, Biden, every special interest. And he sold out on trade. He sold out like almost nobody ever before. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. You ever hear of that beauty? That would have really hit you. In 2017, I signed a historic executive order making government policy to buy American and hire American. I'm watching this Biden and he's got his sign in front, ""Buy American. Oh, by American."" I've been saying that for like 20 years, right? Where the hell has this guy been? They were actually accusing him of plagiarism. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of Wisconsin jobs. And it's all jobs, but you got hit particularly hard. Biden has vowed to remove those tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging. He wants to take the tariffs off that are paying us tens of billions of dollars a year. I fought like hell to keep them into the China deal and he wants to remove them. So tens of billions of dollars, billions and billions, I gave it to the farmers. I gave it to a lot of people, but I gave most of it by far, to the US Treasury. He wants to take them off. So let me just ask you just a very innocent question. There's a young man, about four years old up front, I think he could give the answer. Who do you think would like to have China? How do you think China would feel about this election? In one case, they paid billions and billions of dollars a month to the US. We never got ever, 25 cents from China. In the other case, he said, ""We're going to take them off."" I think they might be inclined to go for Sleepy Joe. This is like a dream for China. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. It's very simple. So we did many things. Not only China, not only the $28 billion farmers. We did so much and I'm proud to announce that I'm doing even more to support Wisconsin farmers. Starting next week, my administration is committing an additional, you've been asking for this for a long time, $13 billion in relief to help farmers recover from the China virus, including Wisconsin's incredible dairy, cranberry and ginseng farmers who got hurt badly. Been after that money for a long time. When the Wisconsin timber industry was threatened, I imposed tariffs on dumped foreign timber and subsidized products, saving many, many timber jobs in your state. If Joe Biden gets in, the radical left will shut down Wisconsin's timber production for environmental reasons. Do you believe that? Oh, boy. It's so sad to see it, and that would happen. But we can't let that happen. We've come too far. We're so good. If that virus hadn't hit us, and it did, and it hit the whole world, but if it hadn't hit us, we would have numbers the likes of which nobody thought were even remotely possible. But it did, and we saved a lot of lives. They keep saying, ""Oh, they just …"" By the way, if we had two people die, they would have said he did a terrible job. If we had 100 people die, if we had 1000, no matter what we do. We have trade deals. We announced a trade deal, everybody is saying how great it is. Schumer and Pelosi see it, they have no idea what the deal is, ""We don't like the deal."" Did you look at it? ""Oh, of course, we looked at it. It doesn't have tariffs. Oh no, it does have tariffs."" They know nothing about the deal. Automatically, anything we do, they just take the reverse. But you know what? I'd probably do it to them too, so I can't complain. And perhaps no issue have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended the catch and release. You know what catch and release is? You catch up them, they may be a killer, they may be a criminal at the highest order, you take their name. Then you're supposed to bring them to a court, like Perry Mason, right? But we actually catch them, take their name, release them, say, ""Come back in about four years for your court case."" We ended all this stuff. And you think that was easy? It wasn't easy, let me tell you. It was tough, but we have a really good, secure border. And the president of Mexico has been terrific. We right now have 27,000 soldiers from Mexico guarding our border, free of charge. We stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens of the worst kind. We're enforcing the clear requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient and not reliant on welfare. They have to sign a document. We invested $2. 5 trillion in the US military, including major contracts to build new warships that helped save the historic shipyard in Marinette. How about that? I was there two months ago. Marinette. That's a great company, but it was having a hard time. And now, they're building, what was that, like $6 billion worth of ships? And their beauties. They've started already, and we worked very hard on that. And we had a lot of help from your congressman on that one, because a lot of people wanted that contract. But we got it for Wisconsin, remember that. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in nearly 75 years. That's right, the Space Force. The fact is, and somebody said it on the other side, an opponent said whether you like it or not, Trump actually did more as president than he promised during the campaign. Like Space Force, that's a big deal. Think of it; army, navy, air force, marine. … Think of it, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, right. Think of it. I mean, that's all you heard your whole life, right. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, Coast Guard; and now, we have the Space Force. You know what a big deal, first time in 75 years, it's a new one. Last one was 75 years ago. The Air Force, right. That's a big thing. I never talked about that on the campaign, I never even thought about it. When I became president, I said, ""We have to do this."" Because I saw what Russia was doing, and I saw what China was doing. And, they've created their Space Forces, I said, ""What are we going to do?, not have it."" It's going to end up being maybe your most important or certainly one of your most important because that's where it's at, in terms of defense, in terms of offense. We passed VA choice and VA accountability for our great veterans that we had the other day. Veterans satisfaction, 91 percent, the highest score we've ever received. You haven't noticed, remember years ago, every story, every night, the Nightly News, you'd always have horrible stories about the VA, you don't see it anymore. Now, I don't want to give them any ideas, because they'll search all over the country for a vet who's unhappy. I'm hurting myself by telling this story. This is not a good story. But remember that, every night you'd have these horror stories about the VA. You don't see that anymore. 91 percent approval rating. I kept my promise recognized the Capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieve the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace; and, you saw that two days ago, UAE, Bahrain, Israel, nobody thought it was even possible. I saw John Kerry on television the other day. ""It is not possible."" Then we waited a little while. He went very, very strong, ""It is not possible."" And, it was not only possible, we have many countries that are joining us very soon. We killed the founder and the leader, the vicious leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. And, we also took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many, many troops and many people, all over the world. Qasem Soleimani is dead, he's dead, bad guy, bad guy, very bad guy. We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home. No one has been more wrong, more often than sleepy Joe Biden. He voted for the Iraq War, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military. I took over a military that was totally depleted, like. Hillary Clinton deleted, as opposed to depleted, she depleted them too; but, she deleted 33,000 emails. When is somebody going to pull the spring? Ah, come on fellows. No, that's terrible. 33,000 emails. Try going to court sometime on a civil case, and when you go before the judge, he'll say, ""Did you delete those emails?"" ""Did you get rid of those texts?"" ""Did you this…, Right."" And, now they caught Weissmann and all these guys cleaning their phones because they were under investigation, and they cleaned their phones. How many were there? 21, but they were like 33 phones. And yet, look what they do to General Flynn, and some of these people that did nothing. They cleaned their criminals, yeah, that's criminal, it's criminal, they're criminals. They talk and talk and talk, they're criminals. They clean their phone, so you don't have any of the information, but that's a big problem for them, I would imagine. It's a disgrace that they can do it. But, Hillary got rid of… She deleted and acid-wash, right. Who acid-washed? Did you ever… And, she also used to bang them with a hammer, remember that, we forgot that, right. So, let's see what happens with all of that stuff. I think Bill Barr's doing an excellent job, I have to tell you. And, he's fighting a very bad establishment in Washington. There's some bad apples in that whole deal. But, if you think that Biden opposed the mission to take out of Osama bin Laden, he was against it. He opposed the killing of Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS, what a mistake. And, he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for America and the world, I don't think so. I don't think so. It's not been too positive. If it were up to sleepy, Joe Biden, bin Ladin and Soleimani, would be alive. ISIS would still be on the rampage and China would now be the dominant power in the world and there not even close, I will tell you. We have weaponry, the likes of which nobody's seen. 2.5 trillion buys you some good stuff, especially when we have the finest scientific minds and military minds in the world. We have weapons, the likes of which nobody's seen, and just hope to God, we never have to use them. I say that, and I say, it's strongly. Hope that we never have to use them. My attitude was that, and I've learned this a long time ago, by having them, we keep ourselves out of war, as opposed to bringing ourselves in war. But, we have built and created weapons, the likes of which this world has never seen before. And, we don't have to talk about it too much, nor do I really want to talk about it. When I ban travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic, he said, ""He's xenophobic."" What does that mean? Joe, tell me. Biden also opposed my plan to ban Europe, I saw what was happening in France and Spain and Italy, and highly infected, we banned Europe. If we had insisted and listened to Joe and insisted on doing what so many other people said doing, which is, ""You don't have to do the ban."" Hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died from the plague. Biden was willing to sacrifice American lives, on the altar of open borders. And now, I hear him talking, he should have followed me. This guy did the swine flu, right, it was a catastrophe. And, the man that headed up the swine flu, I won't use his name because I'd like to have him have a nice evening, because I can't imagine the democrats are thrilled. He said, ""It was a horrible job, we had no idea what we were doing, it was a disaster."" He said, ""It was a disaster."" And now, Biden's telling us how to do what we're doing so well on, what other countries are calling me and congratulating me on the incredible job. And I got sleepy, Joe Biden, trying to tell me how to do it. And, his own man who headed it up, swine flu, it's H1N1 swine flu. Joe called it, N1H1. I keep saying Joe, Joe, it's H1N1, right. I said, ""It's easier to remember because H comes before N,"" but he can't do it. And then, you saw what he said the other day under a Harris-Biden administration. That was a disaster. I never said under a Pence Trump administration, he said, ""Under a Harris-Biden administration."" And, what made it worse, is she said the same thing. That was terrible, right. Sean, right. Did you hear that? They are a disaster together. Through our historic relief programs, we saved more than 1 million Wisconsin jobs and 87,000 Wisconsin businesses, that's not too bad. And, Biden would demolish all of those games, and we've done similar things in other states. He would destroy your social security, totally destroy it, and destroy protections for preexisting conditions. They want to go to social medicine, they want to go to social… You know that, right. You do know that. They want social healthcare where you don't… Remember Obama 28 times, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan, that didn't work out too well, right. Why haven't they looked into that one, 28 times. Well, under Medicare for All, but it's basically socialized healthcare, you will never have your doctor, you will never have your plan. You'll have horrible healthcare. You're going to wait long times, long times. And, he wants to wipe out 180 million private healthcare plans that people love, 180 million plans. I don't think so. I don't think he's going to make it. How do you get elected? Let's say you're doing, not only here, let's say Texas, right, he's against oil, he's against God and he's against guns. That's a tough combination in Texas. How does that apply? Now, he's against religion. They won't open these blue states, they will not open your churches. They won't open them. And, I think they have an ulterior motive. One thing they have is, probably everything opens on November 4th, you understand that. And, they better be careful, those paper ballots you talk about, a bad thing, just get out and vote, get out and vote. And, if you have to go that route, make sure they have it counted. And, they know it's trouble. They just had another election today, fellows, where it's a disaster. The votes come in, they have no idea, they can't count them. And, I don't mean they're off by a little bit, they're off by 20 percent, 25 percent. There's fraud. There's missing ballots. They have a woman in New York who is a terrible congresswoman, you know that. Carolyn Maloney. They gave her an election, they can't even find the ballots. And, they gave her a victory, and they cant find that the guy that is against her, who did very well, even though he's even more progressive, I don't even know what she is. I've known her for 25 years. I don't think she's progressive. I think she's whatever she has to be. But this guy, probably or possibly beat her. So, rightfully he's not too happy. And, they called the election for her and they can't find the ballots. Wants to force you to provide free healthcare to illegal aliens, you remember he raised his hand, that will totally drain your wonderful Medicare. Remember the question up there, he's standing up, "" Who is willing to give free healthcare to illegal aliens."" And, everybody raises their hands like fast. Kamala was right up there. By the way, that will destroy your country, you do know that. Because you can't afford it, and Biden's looking around, ""Oh, they all raise their hand."" He goes, remember. I remember. I said, ""Well, there it goes, the election for him."" He's end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by over 700 percent. And, that's the deal he made with Bernie Sanders, opening the flood gates to terror, afflicted nations. But I predict the Sanders people are going to vote for us, like they did the last time. We had a tremendous…. Because they love my stance on trade, because I know trade, and I was telling him much more so, than even Bernie. But Bernie, is right on that subject, that other countries, including our so-called allies are ripping us off on trade. Biden opposes, school choice and vowed to ban charter schools. Did you know that? Does everybody like charter schools? Everybody likes choice. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. We're all set up to get it done. A vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. It's really a vote for the American dream, instead of letting Washington change us. And, despite all that we've all gone through. We are changing Washington, that's what's been happening. And, just in conclusion, and I hate concluding with you because I like you. I like you. I don't know why the hell I like Wisconsin, but for some reason. You know what helps so, as you know for weeks before the election, she was four up, crooked Hillary, four up, four up, four up, I kept saying, ""Do you think we're going to win?"" And I will say, Sean Duffy said, ""You're going to win."" He actually said, ""Don't worry about it."" Right, Sean. I said, ""Sean do you think we're going to win here?"" I don't like these polls, but four down. He said, ""Sir, you're going to win so easy."" And, early in the night, they said, ""Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin."" And, so when I'm here, speaking in the freezing cold, I'm lucky they had… I said, ""Do you think we have…?"" It's very warm in New York and very warm in Washington, it was hot actually. And I said, ""Do you think we have a coat on the plane?"" They said, ""Yes."" I said, ""What's the temperature?"" ""Sir, it's 49 degrees."" I said, ""How about giving me a coat?"" They have everything on Air Force One, that's the great thing. Got more televisions in any plane in history. They've got televisions in closets, on floors, on ceiling. But, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And, we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We'll make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in the great state of Wisconsin. We will rapidly return to full employment, that's happening very fast, soaring economies; and the record prosperity will be even greater than it was, last year. We will hire more police, increase penalties on assaults of law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities. And, we will ban sanctuary cities, which are deadly. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious Liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear Arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless Foreign Wars. And, you remember with me, they thought because of my personality, they said, ""He'll be in war the first week."" What happened to the war? Remember, we were going to be in war with North Korea. Hillary would have been in war with North Korea. It would have been a nasty one too. But remember, everybody said, I was going to be in war. Everybody said, ""Oh, maybe I'll do something with social security."" And, I did. I saved it and made it stronger. And now, I'm going to make it even stronger. And, they're going to get rid of your social security because everything's going to come collapsing down. You will have a depression. If he gets in, they're going to raise interest rates. They're going to raise your taxes, you will have a depression. The likes of which this country has never seen before. And, your 401k's and your stocks and jobs will go down in flames. I just say it here, hopefully we're never going to experience it, but that's what's going to happen. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which I've already signed. Further reduced health insurance premiums, or the costs of prescription drugs, which are coming down now. You know, I signed favored nations clauses, their drug companies are not happy with me, I will tell you. They never thought it was possible and rebate clauses. They never thought anybody would do that to them. They made enough money for a long time. It's time, you got a big break. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security. And, we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always, you have a pledge. We will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And, NASA is now the hottest space center anywhere in the world. And, when I took over three and a half years ago, there was grass growing in the runways, you know that it was closed down, it was a mess. We are now the hottest in the world. You see what's going up. And, we've got a lot of rich guys sending them up too. I liked that better. I said, ""Let them do it."" Rich guys like rockets, I don't know, they like rocket, boom. I see dollars going right up, but they need a good place to launch. We have the best places. We have the best places, so it's been incredible what we've done with NASA. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We're already there again. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And, we will live by the timeless works of our national motto, In God We Trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America, and standing up for the State of Wisconsin. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get everybody and get out and vote, November 3rd. From Milwaukee to Madison, from Oshkosh to La Crosse. From Green Bay, how the Packers doing so far? Good team, good people, to right here in… Give me the proper pronunciation. That's right, thank you, that's what I said. We inherit the legacy of generations of Wisconsin Patriots, who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed a wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism; and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And, you haven't seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, with the incredible people of Wisconsin, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you. Thank you."
Trump," Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Wow. I will never, ever let you down, that I can tell you. Amazing. And I want to thank Manchester and New Hampshire, they're very special. You remember those primaries? That primary came around and remember what happened during the primary? Trump should come in third or fourth, and we came in easily number one, and that was the beginning. That was an easy one. I want to thank you all. This is incredible and it's great to be back in a state that I love with thousands of hardworking Patriots, who are the heart and soul of America. And that's what you are. We're actually here today to officially launch our campaign to win the great state of New Hampshire in 2020. And I saw some fake polls put out by the fake news media, and it said that I'm tied with three of the other candidates, the Democrats, I'm tied in New Hampshire. I don't think so. One of them has a rally, he's got 100 people. So this holds 12,000 we're full. And we could fill it up four times at least. We could fill it up four times. But I just want to thank you all. I just think it's going to be a tremendous four years. We're going to have a tremendous four years. Can you believe it? We only have a little more than a year to go, where it all started, right? The greatest political movement in the history of our country. And even though we had fake witch hunts on our back and all the other things that we had to go through, we have taken this big beautiful ship, and it's being turned around very quickly. Three years ago, we campaigned across the country on a pledge to make America great again. And that's exactly what we've done. I think we can honestly say it's the greatest slogan in the history of politics in America. Make America great again. So if you don't mind, the other candidates go, they spend millions and millions of dollars on this question that I'm going to ask you. They spend millions. You remember the first slogan from our opponent? That's right, neither do I. Neither does anybody. Nobody remembers. The only thing I remember is the first night I went out after I heard it and I said, see, it's all about her. And they immediately changed it after spending like a million dollars. It's all about her. That didn't work out too well. That slogan wasn't too good. So we have to do this. We have to make a decision. Do you give up the greatest slogan in the history of politics in our country? Make America great again, right? Do we give up make America great again for a new slogan, because look, our country is doing great. We are doing very well with China despite the fact that they want to have you believe in the contrary. All you have to do is say China, how you doing? They're not too happy, they're not too happy. They're losing millions of jobs. The tariffs are working, and they're eating the tariffs by the way. There's no price increase. You know, you gotta talk to these people. The fake news. But do we give up? And by the way, the biggest beneficiary, you know who have been great? Our great farmers have been so incredible because they've been targeted by China, and frankly they've been targeted for a long time, including by incompetent politicians that have run this country for a long time. So we're making up for a lot of lost ground. But do we give up make America great for keep America great? Keep America great. Okay, you ready? Ready? I love this because it's free. And we have all the time in the world, right? Is there anything better than a Trump rally? What about a sleepy Joe Biden rally? Well, he's made some beauties. I sort of hope it's him. I don't mind any of them. You got Pocahontas is rising. We got Kamala. Kamala is falling. You got Beto. Beto is like gone. All right, we'll see what happens. Whoever it is, I don't know that it matters, but whoever it is different, different people. But I don't know, I think sleepy Joe may be able to limp across the finish line. But today they announced that they're going to cut way back on his appearances because he is such a disaster, they're going to have fewer appearances. You've heard that, right? They're going to cut way back on his appearances. Can you believe it? If I ever did that, it would be over. The fake news would get us, but we don't let them get us and it is fake. And today the deputy editor of the New York times was demoted. Isn't that beautiful? All the news that is not fit to print. All the news, the fake failing New York Times. It's really we, it's not me. We're doing it together. They came from the Hills, they came from the mountains, from the rivers, they came from all over the place. And they showed up and they voted like nobody's seen before. And it was 306 to 223, remember? 306. And we won Wisconsin and they said, ""Oh, we never thought of that."" Got to think about those things. And we won Michigan. And now we have a lot of car companies coming into Michigan, and we have a lot of great farming events happening, really big in Wisconsin. And we have incredible things going on in Pennsylvania. We just opened up a $10 billion plant. We have many of them going up. Many of them, a lot of jobs. In Louisiana, an LNG plant $10 billion. Could never have happened, could never have happened. Pennsylvania would have never happened. They wouldn't have allowed him to frack. So they would've never been able to build it. But what a place that is, it will be open in a little more than a year, but I have to make a decision. It's a big decision. Do we give up the greatest theme, phrase, logo, whatever you want to call it, in the history of politics, risky, for a brand new one because make America great again. We're really sort of there, and we have a little time left. And now we have a group of socialists or communists, could be. They're not far away. The fake news will hit me on that. How dare he say that? But they're not far away, right? They're not far away. 95%. Does anybody want to pay 95% taxes? I don't think so. But I'm not going to go into their plan because as far as I'm concerned, the green new deal is a beautiful thing. No, it's a beautiful thing. We want it to continue onward until about a month before the election. I will let them have it like you've never heard before. I don't want it to change. Too early. It's like Elizabeth Warren. I did the Pocahontas thing. I hit her really hard, and it looked like she was down and out, but that was too long ago. I should've waited. But don't worry. We will revive it. It can be revived. It can be rewritten, right? It will be revived and it can be revived very easily and very quickly. And we're going to have some fun in the state of New Hampshire. Now what do we do, ready? Let me have first make America great again, then keep America great, right? Just applaud like crazy for the one you want to use for this campaign. And there's a possibility we'll use both. There's a possibility we'll use both 'cause I hate like hell to give up the one. Is it a possibility we'll use both? Maybe one a little bit less. Are you ready? So we'll start make America great again, and then keep America. Are you ready? Who's in favor of the campaign theme being make America great again? Who's in favor of our theme being keep America great? Oh, wait a minute. This is your hat. I was going to keep it actually. Thank you. So that's really been the reaction. I've done this before. Big crowds, and it really is keep America great because we have these socialists want to take it away from us. They want to take it away. Because until a couple of days ago, and that'll catch up very quickly, we have no choice. By the way, I never said China was going to be easy, but it's not tough and they want to make a deal. We just spoke to them yesterday. They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. They have to make a deal. And you know what? It'd be wonderful to make a deal. I don't think we're ready to make a deal. We're taking in billions of dollars in tariffs. And again, China's devaluing their currency. They're pouring out money, the prices haven't gone up. So that means we're taking in billions of dollars. We're not paying for it. And ultimately their devaluations are going to hurt them very badly. They want to make a deal, and they should want to make a deal. But when you listen to the fake news, look at how many there are. I mean, I actually had something today. I had something today. Are we sure that we're in New Hampshire? You know, you have a reputation. I mean, I know it's not true 'cause I know you too well. You have a reputation of being very stayed, very, very elegant, stayed, incredible people. You're not acting it tonight, and that's good. That's a good thing. Wow. We love our country. We have enthusiasm for our country. That's what it is. Before the election, our factories were closing. Hey, who knows it better than you? You're like central casting for the closing of factories. Our jobs were vanishing. Our military was totally depleted. When I took over, our military was sad. We weren't flying half of our planes, they were old. They were tired. Our equipment was tired. Our people weren't tired, though. Our people weren't tired. But everything we had, it was depleted. Now we've rebuilt our military like never before. And all made in the USA, just so you know. And our nation was weakened at home and disrespected abroad. They don't disrespect us anymore, folks. I got NATO to pay an extra hundred billion dollars. They weren't paying. They were delinquent. Many nations were, except for seven. Many nations weren't paying what they were supposed to be paying, so we're supposed to protect them. They kill us on trade. They have all sorts of barriers and everything else. The taxes are really unfair. The tariffs were ridiculous, what they do to us in Europe. And then we protect them. Then they don't pay, and I say, ""I'm sorry folks, you have to pay. You have to pay."" They were delinquent, they were delinquent. And my biggest fan is secretary General Stoltenberg from NATO. He said until president Trump came along, we were going, boom. They would've been finished very quickly, but I'm tired of paying for other nations anyway, I have to be honest with you. Today, our nation is stronger than ever before. We're now stronger than ever before. You saw we ended the Iran disaster. How about that? We paid them a $150 billion. $1.8 billion in cash. Cash, cash, cash. We got nothing. And they also want to make a deal. China wants to make a deal, and I will tell you Iran wants to make a deal because the sanctions are not good for them. They are not happy. So we'll see how it all turns out. But it's in good hands. It's in good hands. The United States right now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world. We're rebuilding that awesome might that we were just talking about. Our United States armed forces. America is working again. America is winning again, and America is respected again, respected like never before. They respect us again, and you see it. You know, a recent poll came out where it showed that president Obama was more popular in Germany and other places than I am. And I said, of course he's more popular. He's not demanding that they pay for their protection that we provide. He's not doing that. I'm doing that. And in fact, if I was the most popular, I'm not doing my job right. So true. We've created over six million new jobs since the election. If I would have said that during the campaign, those people back there would have been headlines, headlines. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Since my election, the number of new businesses starting in the great state of New Hampshire has skyrocketed by almost 25%. And you can't really go by my election. You gotta go by November 9th because the markets have gone through the roof since November 9th. That's the day after I won the election. So I won the election. The markets went up thousands of points. Things started happening. You started doing things that you would've never. Even though I didn't get sworn in until January 20th, but they refused to do that. And let me tell you, if for some reason I wouldn't have won the election, these markets would have crashed. That'll happen even more so in 2020. See the bottom line is I know you like me and this room is a love fest, I know that. But you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401ks down the tubes. Everything's going to be down the tubes, so whether you love me or hate me, you got to vote for me. I had a businessman the other day, one of the most successful guys in the country. I've never liked him, never liked him. He never liked me, I never liked him. I see him in the white house. I said, ""What are you doing here?"" He said, I'm working to make sure you get elected."" I said, ""You've got to be kidding. You don't like me. I don't like you. What the hell is this all about?"" He said, ""That's right. We've had our differences. I haven't liked you, but to be honest with you, Mr. President, I have no choice."" I said, ""You're right. You're right."" First thing I've ever heard him say that I agreed with, he's got no choice. He got no choice. Unemployment in New Hampshire has reached the lowest rate in actually 31 years. But within a very short period of time, it will be the lowest rate in the history of our country. Think of that. You have the best unemployment, you have the most successful state in the history of your state, and in the history of our country. And then you're going to vote for somebody else? Oh, great. Let's vote for Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren. We have the best numbers we've ever had. Let's vote for somebody else. I don't think that's going to happen, folks. I don't think that's going to happen. Only with fixed poles does that happen? Unemployment for African Americans. You've heard me say this many times, and I'm very proud of it. Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans have all reached their lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our county. Wages are rising quickly. Remember when I used to say people have been working two and three jobs making less money than they made 21 years ago? I used to say it all the time. Now I can say for the first time in 20 years, wages are rising, and you know who's the biggest beneficiary? Blue collar workers. My administration is fighting to expand opportunity for citizens of every background and every race, religion, color, and creed. Very important. Because we are all Americans. We all share the same home. We all share the same heart. We all share the same dreams. We are all children of the same Almighty God. But at the very moment when our country should be coming together to enjoy these wonderful blessings, the radical Democrats are trying to tear America apart. They vilify anyone who doesn't share their extreme views. They slander our law enforcement heroes. You see what they're doing with our police that we love. You see what they're doing. Has anyone ever seen anything like the water being thrown on New York's finest? Have you ever seen? And I know a lot of New York's finest. They're not happy, they're not happy. And they are great people. These are great, great, proud people. For that to be allowed to happen is a disgrace. They view everybody as fascist and Nazis. They used the term Nazi. This was a term, you couldn't even use it. Now they use it like on a regular basis. Nazi. He's a Nazi. Think of that. He's a Nazi. You couldn't use it. Now they use it. They accuse our heroic border agents of running concentration camps, and they do an incredible job. And the Democrats don't want to fix the loopholes or asylum. They do an incredible job, our border agents. And they looked down upon the hardworking citizens who truly make our country run. But while the Democrats rage and resist … That guy's got a serious weight problem. Go home, start exercising. Get him out of here please. You got a bigger problem than I do. Got a bigger problem than all of us. Now he goes home and his mom says, ""What the hell have you just done?"" We are continuing our incredible movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country. There's never been a movement like this. Never. Our movement is built on love, and it is, and we love our family. We love our faith. We love our flag, and we love our freedom, and that's what it's about. And add to that the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our- … the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our country. Together we are all united by one fundamental principal. A nation's first duty must always be to its own citizens, it's own. We've got to take care of our own. You haven't heard that from a politician or a political leader in a long time. It's called America First. It's America First. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many tremendous Republican leaders and great friends of mine, a man who's doing an incredible job as your governor, because I want to take 100% of the credit for the incredible turnaround of New Hampshire, and I remember it not so long ago, things were not looking good. People were leaving, a lot of bad things were happening, but we have to give him a lot of credit. He's been a great governor, Chris Sununu, with a great father too, great father. With a great father… His father was tough. Chris, your father was so tough. He was for somebody else in the primaries, and then one by one… I won here, I won there, I won there. And then when I won his father got on and I said, ""Oh, this guy kills me. He's so tough,"" and he said, ""President Trump will be the greatest of all time. I said, ""What happened? What happened?"" He went from being the toughest critic to the best there is. So I want to say hello to your father, okay Chris? You'll tell him. Great guy. What a family. What a family. Thank you for Chris. New Hampshire Senate Republican leader, Chuck Morse. Chuck. Thanks, Chuck. New Hampshire House Republican leader, Dick Hinch. Thank you, Dick. Thank you, Dick. Great job. A man who was with me right from the beginning. In fact, he had a meeting at his house. His house has never been the same. His house is a disaster now. Like somebody said he just sold it. But you know what? Because of the Trump economy, I'll bet he sold it for a big, big, fat, beautiful profit. Where is Steve? Steve Stepanek and his wife, who's incredible. Did you make a lot of money on the house? We destroyed the house. This was the beginning. He held some kind of a meeting for me, and he has a nice house, but literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people showed up and they destroyed his house. It's never been the same. No wonder you sold it. They finally gave up, and that was four years ago. Anyway, thank you very much both for being here. I appreciate it. What great people. Thank you, Steve. Great job. And I hope the buyer of his house didn't hear that little… Steve. I hope the buyer didn't hear what I just said about your house. He'll cancel… That's all right. You'll sell it for more to somebody else, don't worry. Republican party chair, Ronna McDaniel. You know, Ronna headed up Michigan, and for many, many years nobody won Michigan as a Republican. But I used to complain, I'd go there and I'd say ""They're stealing your car business."" I'd go for years. In fact, five or six years before I even thought about running, for whatever reason, they named me Man of the Year in Michigan. I said, ""How come?"" I didn't even understand it myself, but I was named Man of the Year. I wasn't even political. That was years before I did this. But I was always complaining that our car business is being stolen. I mean, it's sort of obvious, right? Mexico now has 32% of our car business. It all left the state of Michigan. We are bringing it back at a level that nobody's ever seen before, our car business. But I went to Michigan and my opponent was told that the Republicans, no way you can win Michigan, or Wisconsin, that you just can't. And we had a campaign manager named Ronna McDaniel, and Ronna wouldn't stop. ""Sir, can you be here next week?"" I say, ""I don't know."" Then I leave and she said, ""Sir, can you come back in three days?"" I said, ""I don't know."" Then I do it and she said, ""How about another time?"" And then on election night she said, ""Sir,"" it was six o'clock the day before the election. In other words, just a short while before the election. She calls me, ""Sir, can you be here tonight?"" I said ""Tonight?"" And by the way, you know where I was? I was in New Hampshire. That's right. She said, ""Sir, can you be here tonight?"" I said, ""Are you sure?"" I started speaking at one o'clock in the morning. Now it's election day. We had 32,000 people show up. It was like this. The crowd was just, they want to see things happen in our country. They love our country. It went crazy. I left and I said, ""I don't know why going to lose Michigan. Why would we lose Michigan? Look at this."" The opponent went there with Barack Obama and Michelle Obama and she went there much earlier. Prime time, one o'clock, two o'clock in the morning is not exactly prime time. We had 32,000 and they had a tiny little crowd, and I looked at my people and I said, ""I know we're not supposed to win the great state of Michigan, but I think we're going to win Michigan"" and we won Michigan and we won Wisconsin. We won Wisconsin. Wisconsin was a great victory, and we won Pennsylvania, and we won North Carolina and South Carolina, and we won Florida, and I hate to tell you we should've won New Hampshire. That was taken away. New Hampshire was taken away. It was taken away from us, but we should've. We did great in New Hampshire. We should've won New Hampshire, but that's okay. I'm not holding it against you because it was not your fault. But we had a woman in Michigan and I said, ""When it came time to choosing the head of the Republican National Committee,"" I said, ""Who the hell is that woman up in Michigan that got me to keep coming there and explaining that we can't continue to lose our car business?"" We have 17 companies now coming back in. ""Who is that woman?"" And it was Ronna. We put her in charge of the Republican National Committee. The job that she has done is incredible. Thank you. The same with another man, our campaign manager. He started off as a computer genius, and remember when they used to say that the Hillary Clinton campaign is highly sophisticated, highly… She did a lot of bad things folks. 33,000 emails deleted after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress, 33,000. Remember she said it was about her daughter's wedding and yoga classes, 33,000, yes. it was disgraceful. I will tell you this, we now have a great attorney general. A fair guy, a great gentleman. Another man who's here tonight is the world's tallest campaign manager. He is an unbelievable talent. But they were saying about our opponents… I'm not going to mention the name again because we'll never get it finished here, so I'll just say my opponent. Is that better? They were saying how sophisticated her campaign was. Except ours was far more sophisticated, and we had a man that did an incredible job. He's now our campaign manager and he's one of the tallest human beings I've ever seen. His name is Brad Parscale and he is fantastic. It's nice when you don't have to look for anybody. You just look over and you see a guy who's twice as tall as everyone. Great job, Brad. Thank you. How we doing, Brad? Good. Doing good. Got great poll numbers. We've got great poll numbers in a lot of states, Ohio, Iowa. You know Iowa, every week that they campaign our numbers go up. They're winning Iowa. We gave them ethanol, which is very important. A lot of things for Iowa, but every week we seem to be going up in Iowa because they're campaigning in Iowa. Wherever they go, our numbers go up. Somebody's going to have to explain that one to me someday, but we like it. A man who's a friend of mine who was the greatest mayor in the history of New York City. Stand up, Rudy. Stand up, Rudy. Rudy Giuliani. Man, he did a job in the first year. I've never seen anything like it. New York was crime infested. We had problems. We had problems like nobody would believe. Rudy went in there and he did the job and people loved him for it. It wasn't like, ""Oh gee, he's a horrible person."" People loved Rudy Giuliani. He was a great, great mayor. So thank you, Rudy, for being here. The first person that I put on on the campaign, he was driving me wild. He said, ""I'm saying you can win, sir. You can win. I'm telling you, you can win."" He loves this state. He's from this state. He said, ""You can win, sir. I'm just telling you."" I had him on for month after month. He'd come drive me crazy. He'd say, ""You can win, you can win, you can win."" And finally we said, ""Let's give it a shot."" And I had Corey, I had Hope, I had just a couple of people. We had a rather lean and mean staff. But Corey Lewandowski loves your state, loves New Hampshire. He was the first one that talked about us possibly winning the whole big ballgame. He's tough and he's smart and I'm hearing he's thinking about running for the Senate from New Hampshire. There we go. I think he'd be tough to beat. I'll tell you one thing, he'll go into Washington and he's going to have you in mind. He's going to do a job if he does do it, so we'll see what happens. He hasn't made up his mind yet, but he would be fantastic. I guess it's something you go back and you talk to your family, you talk to your wife and you make a decision. They're all saying, ""Are you going to support him?"" I said, ""I don't know if he's running."" So Corey, let us know please, if you don't mind. Let us know. Our shared Republican agenda is pro worker, pro jobs, pro family, pro growth, and 100% pro American. For decades and decades the permanent politicians in Washington pursued the very opposite. They sold out our workers. You see it. You know it better than any place. When I talk about the horrors of NAFTA, the horrors of trade deals… I mean, I'm sorry to tell you this, I usually refer to New Hampshire. Nobody took it worse than new England and nobody took it worse than New Hampshire. Now, here's the good news. I would never let that happen again and Chris will never let that happen again. Is there a doctor, please? Doctor in the house? Thank you. Doctor in the house. Please, doctor, please. Thank you very much. Take your time. Yeah, take your time. Thank you. Take your time, fellas. Plenty of time. You know, people got here two and a half days ago, many of these people in the front, right? Two and a half days ago, a lot of these people, so you can understand. It's pretty tough. Thank you. Thank you. That's okay. These are great people. These are great people that love our country, just remember that. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Pretty good. Pretty good. So our politicians shipped away our jobs, shed our sovereignty, surrendered our dignity, and saddled our nation in one foreign debacle after another, and we're still here. He just said it. We're still here, you better believe it, and we're here stronger than ever before we're here. But all of that ended the day that I took the oath of office, the American people are in charge of their country again. We cut a record number of job-killing regulations that were strangling our country. We cut more regulations in two and a half years than any other president in their full terms. Four years, eight years, or in one case more than that, cut more than anybody. To get relief to working families we passed the largest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country. You're making a lot more money. You're making a lot more money and you see it and you know it because you see it in your paycheck every week. We ended the last administration's cruel war on American energy and we are delivering a policy of American energy independence like you've never seen before. In fact, if you look at the straits where we're having all of the problems, you look at the straits, number one, they're not touching our ships, they're not playing with our ships. They're taking them from this country, from that country, from that country. But you know what? Very importantly, we have very few ships going there anymore because we don't need that oil and gas. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. Every leading Democrat has pledged abolish the American oil, coal, and natural gas industries that are fueling our economic boom. Can you imagine this? We're sitting on great wealth. They want to take it away from us, and the alternatives don't have the power. They don't have the power. They want wind, wind. Wind is oh so beautiful, as long as you don't have to stare at a windmill and your house goes down in value like to nothing. Steve, if you had a windmill anywhere near your house you would've gotten one third of the price you got, Steve. That's true, by the way. Steve's too smart to let that happen. We won't let them take it away from you. We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that shattered New Hampshire and your factories. They shattered your communities and they shattered American power and American prestige all around the globe. New Hampshire lost one in four manufacturing jobs following NAFTA and China's entrance into the Organization, two of the worst deals ever in the history of our world, not just our country. Election after election, politicians came to your state pretending to have the courage to stand up for the American worker, then they went to Washington and let other countries push them around, and special interests, buy them off and steal your jobs and take your companies. That's what happened. Me, I don't care about their campaign contributions. It doesn't matter to me, folks. We want to do a job. We want to do a great job, and we're setting records, and you know who's sending us the money? The small donors. Well, we have big donors, but we have small donors are sending us the money for the election. Pretty amazing. That's not supposed to happen to a Republican, but it's happening to this Republican and it's happening to you. Every vow that politicians made was broken, every hope was dashed, and every promise turned into a total betrayal of New Hampshire and of our country. But in this administration, we have something those sell-out politicians could only dream of. It's called strength and commitment. We don't play games. We don't play games. After years and years of building up other countries we are finally building up our country, standing up for our jobs, our workers, and standing up for our dignity. The forgotten men and women of America will never ever be forgotten again. You were forgotten. The last administration with sleepy Joe and Obama tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated, worse than NAFTA, worse than WTO. It was called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It would have been a disaster. TPP would have gutted the American auto industry. It would have been in shambles. Our auto industry is coming back so strong. It would've gutted, would've destroyed the industry. But in my first week in office I proudly withdrew the United States from that job-destroying catastrophe. We're imposing beautiful well-placed tariffs, money comes in, on foreign countries that cheat our workers, steal our jobs, and break all the rules, I'm sorry. And by the way, they've been changing and charging tariffs on us for years. We have countries that charge us 100%, 200%, 297% in the case of Canada with your farm products. We're not going to stand for it, and man, did we turn things around and we've just started. If companies don't want to pay a tariff, I have one simple solution. Come make your product in America. Come make your product in New Hampshire. Zero tariffs. Zero. No tariff. Together we're restoring this nation's industrial might and we are doing it with American iron, American aluminum, and American steel. We're doing it steel. Steel industry is high. They were dumping steel all over. They were destroying our companies. US steel now, all of them, they're all expanding. the steel industry is back. It's doing great. We're opening up mines in Minnesota, the great state of Minnesota. They have magnificent mines that have the best iron ore in the world and President Obama closed them down. Maybe we can get Representative Omar from Minnesota to open it up, but I don't think so. She'll open them up. I don't think so. Representative Omar, that's another one. We're replacing NAFTA with the brand new USMCA. That's Mexico and Canada. Great deal. The USMCA will create countless jobs for farmers and manufacturers all across the state. We need Congress to pass the USMCA immediately. We'll make it a bipartisan deal. We don't even want credit. The unions benefit. The non-unions benefit. Everybody benefits. It brings it back to fairness and it makes it very hard for our companies to leave our countries, go to Mexico or Canada. We lose all our jobs. We lose all our taxes. We end up with empty factories and plants. It makes it almost impossible. We're not going to have that. That was my one rule that I had to have. It's going to be very, very hard for companies to do that. I've also taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China's chronic trade abuses. Earlier this month, the US government officially labeled China for the first time ever a currency manipulator, another promise kept. While others allowed China to freely loot the US economy, $500 billion a year, not million, not million, billion with a B. We've made it clear that the theft of American jobs and American wealth is over. Yet today, the Wall Street Journal editorial board and some others continue to publish foolish articles that demonstrate that they understand nothing about trade or business. Nothing. They advocate only economic surrender. They actually say, ""Go to China, take off the tariffs, make a deal."" I lose all the cards we take off the tariffs. We don't have any cards. Think of it. They say ""Go to Europe."". By the way, the European union is worse than China, just smaller. It treats us horribly. Barriers, tariffs, taxes, and we let them come in. It's worse than China. Many of us come from there. I do. That's what it's got going. That's about it. They treat us really badly, and many others, many, many others. India tariffs us probably higher than any nation anywhere in the world. We have tariffs of 100% on products and much more than that. India. So we're working on all of them. I called Prime Minister Modi. I said, ""Mr. Prime Minister, it's not fair. We've got to change, we've got to change, we've got to change,"" and we're talking to them very seriously. We're talking to a lot of places. But when the Wall Street Journal comes out and they say, "" No, no, take the tariffs. Go and talk to China."" They've been trying to talk to them for 25 years. But actually, you know what? They really haven't. The fact is the leaders that were in my position, they didn't do a damn thing. They didn't talk. They didn't talk. Past leaders followed the terrible advice of these editorial boards that are frankly totally inexperienced in business, I guess, and our industries were utterly decimated. Globalism enriches foreign countries at our expense. Globalism. I love our country. I'm the President of the United States of America. I'm not the president of the the world. As long as I'm president, America will never bow to a foreign nation like we were for so many years. As we restore our prosperity, we are also restoring public safety. We are fighting to reduce violent crime. You see so much, and over the last 25 years so much crime, and ensure that every American can live in safety and peace. And yet with all that you see, we've had one of the best years of crime prevention that we've ever had. It wouldn't seem that way, but it is one of the best years because those gentlemen that we just saw, the law enforcement, they do a great job. You've been reading about this a lot lately. We are working very hard to make sure we keep guns out of the hands of insane people and those who are mentally sick and shouldn't have guns. But people have to remember, however, that there is a mental illness problem that has to be dealt with. It's not the gun that pulls the trigger. It's the person holding the gun. Years ago, many cities and states, I remember it so well, closed mental institutions for budgetary reasons. They let those people out onto the street. You probably have your examples up here. I can tell you in New York they closed so many of them and they let really seriously mentally ill people out on the streets, and you see plenty of them today, even today. We're going to have to give major consideration to building new facilities for those in need. We have to do it. And at the same time, we will be taking mentally deranged and dangerous people off of… … Mentally deranged and dangerous people off of the streets so we won't have to worry so much about that. The big problem. We don't have those institutions anymore and people can't get proper care. They're seriously ill people and they're on the streets. We can't make it harder for good, solid law abiding citizens to protect themselves. We will always uphold the right to self defense and we will always uphold the second amendment. We will. So important. One of the most powerful promises I made to the people of this state was to confront the opioid and drug epidemic. I used to go around New Hampshire more than any state and you'd say, ""Sir, the state is infested."" You said, ""Sir, we'll like a drug den."" You tell me. And I didn't really see it. And then I met with the police officers and fire departments and all the people that do. And you just seem to have a bigger problem. And by the way, the wall is being built. That's- That's going to stop a lot of it. The wall is being built. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. It's being built. You know, we have the fake news. You know about that, where they … A wall that's lying on the ground in a very important section. So we pick up the wall, it's in pieces. I mean literally it's gone and we build a brand new 30 foot steel and concrete wall and the fake media said, ""He didn't build a wall. That's just renovation. There was no wall, it's lying on the ground."" People walk right over and it's rotted, rusted, gone. We take it away. We put a brand new wall up. They give me no credit. You know why? Because they're fake news. That's why. We're building a lot of walls. The Army Corps of Engineers is doing a great job. They're doing a great job. Since I took office, we've attacked the challenge with everything we have. We have secured a record $6 billion in new funding. Opioid. We vastly increase the distribution of overdose reversing drugs, which are pretty amazing things. We've given them to your police department, your fire department, pretty amazing. We have reduced the total amount of opioids prescribed by 34%. The department of justice has prosecuted more than 3000 defendants in opioids related cases. And our public awareness campaign about the terrible suffering that drugs inflict has already reached 58% of all young Americans. I said that you have to show them. We're doing ads beautiful ads. Shows them, and you've seen them. I don't even want to describe them. They're brutal. But we're doing ads on television and papers about how bad it is for children so they can see it. Because the greatest thing we can do is not get people started on drugs, right. Not get them started. It's hard to get off. You know, we can get them off and we're doing it and it's been done. But it's hard to get off. If they never start. It's real easy. It's real easy. So we're trying to get young kids, you won't see the fruits of this labor for a little while because it takes a while. But we're really, we are working so hard on advertising and promotions to tell young kids, children how bad drugs are, how dangerous they are, how horrible they are, how they destroy your brain, how they do so many bad things. And they're really very tough ads. They're hard hitting ads. And I think they're having a big impact. You'll see over time you'll see. Over time you'll see. But we still have much work to do. But as a result of these efforts, last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in 31 years. That's pretty amazing. And at the center of America's drug crisis is the border crisis. Vast quantities of deadly narcotics are being smuggled across the border including meth, cocaine, heroin and fentanyl. And as part of my trade deal with China, it's been very important. And President Xi said he's going to do it. So far he has not done it. But I said, ""You have to stop sending us fentanyl."" Have to. ""And you have to criminalize in China the making of fentanyl."" And so far he has not come through, but I think he will. You'll know, you'll know. Yet Democrats want to open borders and Republicans want strong borders. That you're difference. One wants open borders. Who can even think of an open border? Think of it? Even though many people that come into our country are wonderful people, they're are still coming in illegally. They're not coming in through merit. But what about the bad ones? We have serious, serious criminals that want to come in, and if we had open borders they would be flowing in like you've never seen before. Democrats want open borders, they don't mind crime. We do mind crime and that's the way it is. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities. Last year alone sanctuary cities declined more than 17,000 requests from federal authorities to hand over criminal aliens already in their custody. In other words, 17,000 criminal aliens were released by these cities directly into US communities. You don't understand even what the hell are they doing? What are they doing? 17,000. Republicans believe our city should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. We will always support the amazing heroes of ICE and Border Patrol, and we will always support law enforcement. Every Democrat candidate also wants to give illegal immigrants free welfare. Republicans believe public benefits should be protected for truly needy Americans, not for illegal aliens. And we should reduce our taxes and many other things with all of that money that we're talking about. We need to elect a strong Republican majority to end sanctuary cities. Stop human traffickers, stop drug smugglers and adopt an immigration system that puts the needs of American workers and families first. It's also time for Democrats to join with us to protect the sacred integrity of our elections by supporting voter ID, voter identification. It's incredible. They're constantly saying, ""Oh, we need to protect them."" But they're not looking for that. They're not looking for that. We say, ""What about voter ID? In other words, you have a picture, you have to go up. What about voter ID?"" That they don't want to do, but we need voter ID. The Democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream. Where do they come from? You know, you say you want low taxes, good education, strong military, strong borders. You want to have safe homes. You want a house, you want low interest rates, you've got low … Hey, you got low interest rates. The lowest ever. Got low rates, it's a good time to refinance your house, by the way. Great time. You got everything, and then you see these people they're against … They have no idea what they're doing. They have no idea what they're against. Every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would raid Medicare and destroy the private health insurance plans of millions of American families that they love. My administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you. The individual mandate is gone. The most unpopular part of Obamacare, and we almost have Obamacare gone. We're close. We would have had it before, but we had a vote that was a little bit surprising. I'm sure none of you knew who that vote was. We had it done, repealed and replaced. But it's going to happen and I think it's going to actually be in the end, actually better. You watch. So we got rid of the individual mandate, which was the most unpopular part of Obamacare. And we're running it better. You know, I had a political decision. Do I make it great? Alex Azar our secretary, do rerun it well and sort of say, ""Hey, we run it well."" Or do we run it badly and have everybody upset? We said, we got to run it well, but it's still much too expensive. It's lousy healthcare. But we got rid of the worst part of it. Individual mandate, individual mandate, where you have the privilege of buying the right not to have to pay for expensive insurance. that's no good health insurance. And we won't … And you got to remember this. Republicans, and I speak for every one of them, we will always protect pre-existing conditions. We're going to protect, always. Right, got to do it. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in 51 years. The only decline in 51 years. We have launched a historic initiative to require price transparency, empowering you to choose the lowest price for yourself and for your family. Believe it or not, you didn't have the right to go in and price your drugs. Who could even believe this? I wonder if big pharma had something to do with that. So we're going to have transparency. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb. Right up, up till … Right up until the moment of birth. And in the case of the Virginia governor, he's having a rough, rough time. In his case, the baby is born, and then he goes to talk to the mother. The doctor talks to the mother. The baby is now born, wrapped as he said, and then they decide whether or not to execute the baby. Who would believe that. That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred, the gift of God. Hard to believe isn't that. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion and socialism. The Republican party is the party of freedom. We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream and I'm fighting for you each and every day. So importantly we have confirmed more than 140 federal judges. Within 90 days it will be 179 federal judges. Thank you very much President Obama. Thank you very much. I don't know what happened to them, but I came to office and I had 138 judges that were not appointed by President Obama. So I say, thank you Mr. President, very good and they'll say he was a great president. Oh, the fake news. He was a great president. If he was a great president how come he left me 138 judges to appoint when everybody says that's the single most important thing a president of the United States has to do. Great president. He was great. He was a great president. And these judges will apply the law as written, including we appointed two great Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. And to help patients with life threatening illnesses we also pass something I'm so proud of, 44 years they couldn't get it passed, right to try. You can use our newest, our best medicines. Incredible. What's happening. I'm so proud of that. And this from forever, five decades. We pass for our great veterans VA choice and VA accountability. And one of our great friends was a veteran who's been with me in New Hampshire. I don't know where you are. Where's our guy? Where is he? So, Al. So, I walk in I said, hello. He's been with me from the beginning. He wasn't with … He liked Trump. And I came in. He said, sir, he's a great veteran. He said, ""Sir, I have cancer. And sir, I went into the vet. They were very, very late. They had problems. I'm not blaming them, but they gave me the right to go out and get a great cancer surgeon."" He had his operation. You look much better than you did three years ago Al, much better. Much better. VA choice, right Al. VA choice. Great story. Thank you very much, and thank you for your loyalty. He's been to every rally I ever gave a New Hampshire right from the beginning. I got so tired of looking at him. He'd always be here. Now he's … Look at him, now he's sitting in very good. That's good. But I appreciate that story. I appreciate. VA choice just makes sense, right? Doesn't it make sense? We've achieved record funding for the United States military. $716 billion, $700 billion and $738 billion. And it's almost completely rebuilt. Including, and we hope to God we never have do use it. We have the finest, most powerful nuclear capability anywhere on the face of the earth. And I hope to God we never have to use it. We're investing in the future of human space flight. And someday soon American astronauts will plant the stars and stripes on the surface of Mars. I told my guys at NASA, you know, NASA, when we took it over, it was exhausted. The runways and the grounds had all weeds growing through the cracks in the concrete. You wouldn't recognize it now. It's beautiful. It's the best place anywhere on earth. And I also said, though, you know, I hear all these rich guys for some reason, they love space. So they're rich. I said, let them send the rockets up. What the hell do we have to do it? Right? So I see Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, they're putting rockets up. I think it's great. And they pay us rent. They use our facility. That's great. But we're also doing it, and NASA has some of the greatest plans we've ever had. These are great people, great scientists. But we also let the private sector put up rockets. The one which recently went up and you see the engines coming back down and they coming … There's no wings, no nothing. It's almost like, what are we watching is this fiction? And they come down and they save all of the propellants. All of the, really the most expensive parts. They're able to save it by bringing it back right to where it took off. Who would think they could do this? I never saw this before six months ago, but they're doing it now more and more. They're saving a lot of the most important and expensive parts of rockets. So we have a lot of rich guys paying us a lot of rent. But we're also doing it ourselves. To protect America's security. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And just three months ago, we also recognized the Golan Heights as being a part of and protected by Israel. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of New Hampshire. Thank you. And you must never forget the 2020 election right around the corner. 2020 right around the corner. And it's about one thing. You know what the one thing is, you. It's about you. It's about your family. It's about your future. And it's about the fate of your country. So when we ran together last time, we said the most importantly we had to turn it around. This country was going bad. You see what happened to Venezuela with socialism? Venezuela 15 years ago was one of the richest countries. Now they don't have water, they don't have food, they don't have anything. And this was one of the richest nations in the world. They don't have anything. We're working on it. We're helping people, but it's very sad. It's never going to happen to us because we will never ever be a socialist nation. Ever. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction … The destruction of the American dream. We have a dream. It's a great dream. This the destruction of the American dream. We begin this campaign tonight with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for the people of New Hampshire and for the people of America. Together we will lift millions more citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Millions and millions of people. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that are already happening that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, ending the AIDS epidemic in America and finding new cures for childhood cancer. Something I never thought I'd be able to say, within one decade the AIDS epidemic in the United States will be gone. Think of that. Did you ever think you were going to hear that? No. Did you ever think you were going to hear that? The work they've done on AIDs is incredible. That's an incredible thing. When they told me that, it's just shattering. It just, it breaks your heart what's happened. But think of it in 10 years, the AIDS epidemic will be eradicated. So great. Who thought that was going to be happening. Who thought I'd be able to get to say that so early in what we're doing together. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious Liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together. There is one America we will support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We'll stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. Through every day and every challenge our hearts speak to the words of the New Hampshire state motto, live free or die. We are fighting for every American mom and dad who wants to protect this land of Liberty for their precious, beautiful children. We are fighting for every young boy and girl who deserves to grow up in a nation of builders and dreamers, pioneers and patriots, and we are fighting for every citizen of the greatest Republic on the face of this earth. Every day my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The brave this beautiful, strong, proud, and free future. It belongs to us. It's up to us. We control our own destiny. And with your help, your devotion and your drive. We are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one great movement. One people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And together we are making America wealthy again. We are making America strong again. We are making America safe again. And we are making America great again. Thank you. New Hampshire. Thank you. Thank you."
Trump,"Hello, everybody. Hello, everybody. Wow. Hello, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. And I'll tell you, we're landing and there are thousands of people along the runways, and I said, ""Why aren't they here?"" ""Sir, we couldn't let them in."" ""Why not? Let's let them in."" Oh, these people. And then they put in a floor. This is for Manchester because you know about flooring. They put in a floor that's like an ice skating rink. So we're going to tiptoe around. How are you, everybody? We love you. We love you. Great, great people. Manchester, we had some good memories in Manchester. 2016, but this is going to be, we are right now in the most important election in our history. But I'm thrilled to be back in the Granite State with the true hard-working American Patriots. Last night it was my great honor to accept the Republican nomination for President of the United States. We're going to win. We're going to win. Does anybody have any doubt? Does anybody… It's very interesting, last night we had an incredible time and I don't know if you know, it's driving the fake news crazy. They're back. But the poll numbers have swung. If you go back six months before the plague flew in from China, the plague, the horrible plague, this election was over. This election was over. And then I had to go back to work. I had to go back to work. And then I went back to work and we've done an incredible job in every aspect of running government, but I also had to start campaigning a little bit again, and I did. And today it was announced that Joe Biden is coming out of the basement. Because the poll numbers have totally swung. They totally swung. And they've swung like nobody's ever seen them swing before. And it was rapid. It was a rapid swing. Because they all admit that we're doing a great job. There's not too many presidents that have done a job like we've done, including keeping you out of wars, bringing you home from the endless wars. But they've swung. But here's what I don't get. Sleepy Joe's coming out he said in 10 days, that's a long… 10 days. 10 days. That's like an eternity in Trumpville. 10 days. I view 10 days is like an eternity, okay? So he decided he's coming out and he's going to be out in 10 days. That's a long time. That's a big percentage of the remaining time. That's all right, he's much better off where he is. I think he's, I think he just… And how about those stories from friends of mine? How about those stories? Was that just compelling and incredible television, but really that was an exciting, a really good quality convention. Really great. So many people. So many people, you saw some tragic situations, some really great endorsements, you saw everything. If you… How about the endorsement of Herschel Walker? When you watch that that was from the heart. That was from the heart. Dana White today. I just saw it today because last night I was looking at this speech a little bit. We had a wonderful turnout last night. What I didn't like, you saw this right, when it was over, you saw when it was over? The thugs outside because the Democratic mayor of Washington DC, it's another Democrat that's not believing in law and order. And you know we give Washington DC a lot of money to run it, but they don't do a good job of running it. The mayor, she doesn't run anything. And these incredible people from all over the country, all over the world that were there last night, they walked out to a bunch of thugs. And that wasn't, remember this, that wasn't friendly protesters. They were thugs. They were thugs. And the DC police are good, but the mayor gave bad instructions last night, that should have never been allowed to happen. When a senator like Rand Paul walks out, and thank God we had some good police around him and they took a tremendous… They took tremendous abuse. And Rand Paul was in big trouble last night, he's a good guy, he's a friend of mine, and that shouldn't happen to anybody. But he is a US senator walking outside and those four policemen should be brought over to the White House and we ought to give them a medal of some kind, and we're going to do it. We're going to do it. I told that to Rand. And the mayor should be ashamed of herself for that kind of a display of incompetence because that's what's happening in Portland. And that's what's happening all over where you have Democrat-run cities. Just take a look. And we're looking at the whole situation in DC, and tonight they have a lot of people gathering, let's see how that works out. They have to be able to manage their affairs, they get a lot of money. She's always looking for money, ""Could we have more money?"" ""What are you going to waste it on? I mean spend it on. What are you going to waste it on, Mayor?"" And then our people walk out, and these are people from all over the world, they walk, including Congress, by the way, they walk out and they get accosted, they get abused, they get spit on. It's a disgrace. And our country is going to change. We're not going to allow that to happen. You know, we're not supposed to be… We're not supposed to be involved unless we're invited in by the people that run, these are all Democrat cities, just so you understand, including DC. So we're not supposed to go in unless we call it an insurrection, but that's a big statement. It's a big statement. No reason for it. But you know what we're going to do? We're going to have to look at it. Mark Meadows is here, we're going to have to look at it because we're not going to let that happen to people that go to the White House to celebrate our country. And a weak guy named Joe Biden, and he's weak, he's weak as hell, a weak guy like Joe Biden didn't even bring law and order up as a subject for discussion in the entire Democrat National Convention. Now they're all of a sudden… Now they realize because they've gone down like a rock in water, they've gone down in the polls and now all of a sudden they're talking all, ""Well, we have to talk about crime."" Number one, they have no… Look at what happened to New York, look at what's going on in Chicago, all Democrats, all radical left Democrats. Look at what's going on in the great State of Wisconsin. Now I will tell you, two days ago we sent in the National Guard. That was the end of that problem. Look at Portland. We want to send in the National Guard, we sent in Homeland Security just to protect our… couple of our buildings, including a courthouse, can you believe it? We sent in because- … couple of our buildings, including a courthouse. Can you believe it? We send in because they can't protect it. So we sent, they did a very effective job. We could take care of Portland in 45 minutes, 45 minutes. If that governor, if that mayor would call and say, ""Please send in the National Guard."" just like … Hey, we did it in Minneapolis. Remember that? The place was going to burn down. Another few days, we send in the National Guard, it was over within an hour. They ought to get smart and that's what they ought to do. So now they're talking about, ""Well, we want to …"" Why did they call it a friendly protest? Right? Remember the idiot from CNN, he's standing there. This is a friendly protest. Behind him over his shoulders, the entire city is burning down. Sixty seven days from now, we're going to win the great state of New Hampshire. We have to. We're going to win four more years in the White House. Within my first term in office, we've secured America's borders, brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt the United States military. It was a mess. It was a depleted mess. Wiped out the ISIS caliphate, killed our terrorists enemies, kept America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. Achieved American energy independence. You see the price of your gasoline. When you go fill it up, ""Oh boy, that's a nice price."" It's half what it was. We built the single greatest economy in the history of the world. That includes China, which was having a very, very bad year. Then the plague came in from China. We had to close it up. We saved millions of lives and now we're open again and we're setting records. We're setting records. Wait till you see the numbers just before the election. There'll be released and this is despite the fact that the Democrats are holding back Michigan, North Carolina. You take a look. Pennsylvania. They want to keep them. By the way, on November 4th, regardless, they'll be opening them up, November 4th, because they think that hurts the economy and that will hurt me, but our numbers are going to be great. We're going to have a great third quarter. We're going to have an unbelievable next year, unless somebody stupid gets elected and raises your taxes. This November, each of you will vote in truly the most important election in the history of our country. I used to say it about 2016. This is now at a new level. Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to obliterate and destroy everything that you hold here including your second amendment, which will have no chance. Your vote will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow Biden to eliminate your jobs. By the way, it's not Biden. It's not Biden. It's his masters, his … They tell him what to do, his masters. They want to erase your borders, confiscate your guns, appoint radical left judges and prosecutors, tear down our history. Demolish your suburbs. You saw what I did. I ended the rule. You're not going to have low income housing built in your suburbs anymore, but nobody writes that because the fake news doesn't want to write that, but everyone knows. Unless our friends in the suburbs have gotten a lot dumber than they used to be, they know that. They want to destroy your suburbs, indoctrinate our children, defund the police and try everything in the book to turn our cities so that they look more like Portland, Oregon than what we're used to looking at. Never forget, they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. It's true. Today's Democrat party is filled with hate. Just look at Joe Biden supporters on the streets screaming and shouting at bystanders with unhinged manic rage. Right? You see it. It's crazy. It's crazy. You ought to see last night in Washington. It was a disgrace. It was a disgrace that these people are representing the United States of America. It was a disgrace. Protesters. You know what I say? Protest is your ass. I don't talk about my ass. They're not protestors. Those aren't … Those are anarchists. They're agitators. They're rioters. They're looters. They're not … You know you say that and some of the people, not all of them, but some of the people back there, ""Oh, how dare you. These are friendly protesters, right?"" Friendly … They're just looking for trouble. Has nothing to do with George Floyd. Has nothing to do with anything. They don't even know who George Floyd is. Okay? They don't know who George Floyd. They have no idea. If you ask them, ""Who's George Floyd?"" They couldn't even tell you. These are just bad people, troublemakers and they shouldn't be representing our country at important events and we've got to stop it. Democrats have no complaint about the rioters and the vandals, marauding through our cities or mass unruly demonstrations, but they don't believe law abiding citizens can go to a church together. You can't go to church anymore. You know how many churches are closed in this country because of the Democrats? You can go out and you can have thousands of people marauding through the streets, threatening other people, beyond threatening, kicking them in the face, doing what they've done. You've seen it. They would have done that to Senator Rand Paul last night. He'd either be in very bad shape or dead and that would include his wife if those policemen didn't happen to be there. They took some big beating. The reason they didn't fight back too much, they don't want to lose their pension. They don't want to lose their job, because we've become so politically correct, everybody's afraid to do anything now, but they did a good job. The puppet Biden, who's just controlled so strongly wants you to cancel weddings, funerals and school, but has no problem with thousands of so-called peaceful protesters cramming into your streets, mugging people, hurting people, robbing stores, looting stores, burning down storefronts. The radical left will do anything to get power. They smear justice, Brett Kavanaugh, and they are … Did you see anything like that? Justice Kavanaugh. People forget. Time goes by, they forget. We don't forget. I don't forget. They're destroying the livelihoods of innocent people and if Biden wins, which I honestly can't believe can happen. I will have lost to a low IQ individual. I don't want that. I don't want it. Sleepy Joe, I don't want it. But the agitators will go from rioting in the streets to running the halls of government. Can you believe it? The levers, they call it the levers of government. The top 10 most dangerous cities in America are run by Democrats and have been for decades. Now they're trying to impose those policies across the entire country. No one will be safe in Biden's America. I can't even call it Biden's America. God doesn't know he's alive. He's going to be out in 10 days. He's going to start 10 days. Ten days. I mean, I gave a big speech last night. I said, ""What am I doing tomorrow night?"" You're going to New Hampshire, but sir, we can cancel New Hampshire because you had a big night. We can cancel. Are you crazy? I don't have the courage to cancel New Hampshire. I got to win New Hampshire. I love the people and you've been very good to me. You've been very good to me. You've been very good to me. So, New Hampshire was the first state I won. Right? Remember, I came here. I was very excited. That was an exciting evening. That was an exciting race, but we don't talk about that anymore. We have to talk about the future. We don't talk about it. That was great. It was important. We've done more than any administration in its first three and a half years in the history of our country. That's despite phony witch hunts, phony investigations, a phony impeachment based on a phone call that was absolutely perfect. That's despite a pandemic that was probably sent in by China, who the hell knows how it got here and all over the world, because China does not want to see me win I can tell you that. We're not happy with China. I'll tell you why. If Biden got in, China would own the United States very quickly. They'd own it. If the Democrat party wants to stand with anarchist, criminals, rioters, looters, and flag burners, that's up to them. The Republican party and you, I can see you. Is there anybody in this place that enjoys burning the American flag? Is there anybody? Please quietly raise your hand. Be careful. Could be very dangerous. The Republican party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and our law enforcement. Right? We are all that stand between the American people and the left wing mob. If you want to save democracy from the mob, then you must vote to defeat an extremely poor candidate. Look, I believe I have the honor of running against the worst candidate ever put up by the Democratic party, the worst. How do you get worse? I believe he's the worst candidate, the slowest candidate. I mean, in prime time, he was the slowest candidate, which was a long time ago. Primetime. You know what I don't like though, they say he's like 78, 79, 78, I guess. Right? I know people that are 85, that are 88, 92, Bernie Marcus, Home Depot, he's 92 years old. He's the sharpest guy you'll ever meet. There's nothing … 78 is okay, but that's a bad 78, not a good 78. 78 is okay, but he shouldn't say that. They shouldn't say … The press, they say he's too old. He's not too old. He's not too old, but 78 is okay, but I do. I know people in their 90s that are 100% sharp and good physically, actually good physically. You want debate? So do I. I want debates too. I want debates too. Tonight, we're honored to be joined by New Hampshire House Republican leader, Dick Hinch. Where is Dick? I think your great governor is here. Where's the governor? Where's our governor? Hi, Dick. Good job. Do we like Dick? Yes. Where's our governor? He's here. He just met me. I told him, ""Go back."" Hi, Steve. Because you have a great governor and we don't have same day voting anymore. We don't have same day. What a joke that was last time, remember? Buses poured up from Massachusetts with a lot of people that weren't going to vote for Trump, and they poured up thousands and thousands of people came in on election day and then you had a senator running on the Republican party who wasn't exactly the greatest for us, but we have done so well here and we're going to have a big win. I'm hearing we're going to have a great win. So, I want to thank you, governor. Also with us, our state representatives, Al Baldasaro and Fred Doucette. Where are you? Hi. Hi, Al. I know these guys so well. Hey Al, have I taken care of the vets better than you even thought? This guy I met him. He's a big vet. He wanted the vets. He didn't care about anything else, but the vets. Honestly, he couldn't have cared less about anybody here except the vets, but I did a good job, right? We did a good job for the vets. Very importantly, very, very US Senate candidate Corky Messner. Good, Corky. I hear you're doing well. Good, Corky. Get them. We need Corky. Get them. I hear you're doing well, Corky. Congressional candidate Matt Mowers. Matt, thank you. Thank you, Matt. Great people. A friend of mine for a long time, he said right from the beginning, ""You're going to win this state, sir."" We met him at the primaries. Chairman of New Hampshire Republican Party Steven Stepanek. Steven. Hi, Steve. Great Steve. Co-chairman of my New Hampshire campaign Lou Gargiulo. Where's Lou? Lou Gargiulo. Hi, Lou. How am I doing? Are we winning, Lou? Lou, are we winning? Thank you. You said yes. If he said no, he's out of here. A friend of mine and a friend of the state, he loves this state and he is a smart cookie. So good. I love him on television. He's no games. Just looks and gives her the answer, but he's done a fantastic job. The first person on my whole … You read about all these people. This is the first guy and he's a great guy and he's a friend of mine, Corey Lewandowski. Where is Corey? Great guy. Tremendous guy. Tremendous help. Thank you, Corey. Are you having a good time, Corey? Who's going to win this year, Corey? You bet. A little bit slow with that head, Corey. With the help of everyone here today, we've accomplished more in the first three years. We've done so much. We've done so much. You can go over at taxes and you can go over what we've done with the military. We passed the biggest tax cuts ever, ever the history of our country. Now, they want to raise taxes. Think of it. All my life, I've watched politicians. Don't forget, I've only been doing this for four and a half years. I haven't been to … I've had senators come in. I've had congressmen come in. ""Sir, I've been doing this for 25 years and in 25 years I've only lost three races, sir."" I said, ""But I've only been doing it for four years and I only won one race, but now I have to win two. One race I won, but it was the president. It was for president."" It was for president, but we did the largest tax cut in the history of our country. We eliminated the most job destroying regulations in the history of our country. I ended the job killing Paris climate accord. That was a killer. That was meant to hurt the United States. By the way, in case you had any questions. Today, the United States is the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth. To give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed and hopefully anybody here doesn't need it. Nobody here. Uh-oh, do you need it? Uh-oh. Don't raise that … Oh she is? Is she okay? I'll get it for her. Is she okay? We got to get her on the list. Tell me. Oh, from before. Well, that's a long time before I was president. Does she want to get on the list? Because I've seen you at rallies before. I want to get … Will you please, I want to get his wife on the list. It's called right to try. Right to try. Good work. He's been a friend of mine. Come on. He's been here for a long time. He's been a good guy for a long time. We got to … Is your wife, how she doing? She couldn't get it before me. Well, we had that with Mueller. You saw that with the Mueller's last night. You saw that, right? Was that Assad with their incredible daughter, what happened? He said if Trump was president that wouldn't have happened and they're right, that would not have happened. We took out al-Baghdadi. I wish I were president, you would had a different solution. Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead. How about you? Yeah. We'll talk to you later. Right to try. You have no idea. So many people, they used to travel all over the world to get a cure. Now, we can sign a quick simple document. It sounds easy, it wasn't, but it was easy for me. I understood it. Now, you signed a document. We give you the greatest medicines even if they haven't been approved. If somebody's terminally ill, like in the case of your wife, if somebody's terminally ill, at least you have hope, but it's beyond that because people have gone home. You have to see some of the results have been incredible. You saw one of the people the other day, right? That wonderful young lady that was so incredible and spoke so well. She's a special person. She really is a special person. Thank you. We'll talk to you. Thank you very much. To bring opportunities to our inner cities, I signed the groundbreaking criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. True. Before the China virus came in, before that China virus came in, we had the best job numbers ever recorded the history of our country. We had almost 160 million Americans working. We had never had numbers like that. The Republican party is the party of Abraham Lincoln. Remember that. We- We stand for so much, including Martin Luther King's dream of a nation where our children are judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. You know that. The radical left's effort to divide everyone by race tears us apart. There's so much racial hatred, and it's put there by CNN, by MSDNC… They stoke the flames and they know it. The good news is the ratings aren't great. So that's okay. They don't have great ratings. But they stoke the flames. Uh-oh, CNN just turned off their camera again. They always turn off their camera. Why do I keep doing that? Every time I do it, they turn off their camera. They did it last time. I mention CNN, they're screaming, turn the camera off. Our movement is about a brighter future for all Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the African American community. I've spent the last four years delivering for the African American community like nobody, with the exception possibly of Abraham Lincoln, has delivered before. It's true. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from the last administration's horrible, stupid, insane Trans Pacific Partnership. Would've destroyed the US auto industry and many other industries. New Hampshire lost one in four, and I think much more than that, manufacturing jobs following twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO. It was more than one in four. That statistic is wrong. Please have it changed. The statistic is wrong, far more than one in four. Earlier this year, I kept my promise and replaced the NAFTA nightmare with a brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. They said that couldn't be done. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging and plundering of American jobs. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in America. After years of building up other nations, we are finally building up our nation and our jobs, and we're taking care of our people. Last night, I got great reviews of the speech and all, but some of the fakers back there, they said, ""Well, it was a little long. He shouldn't have used the White House."" Oh really? Tell me. But they said it was a little… Then one person, I think it was Chris Wallace. Nice guy. He's actually a nice guy. He said that, ""He didn't have the same energy in the speech that he usually has."" Well, it's a different kind of a speech. Tonight, I'm in New Hampshire and we can wing it. See, actually, actually Chris, who has always wanted to be his father, but it never worked out because of a lack of talent. Actually though, actually Chris has it wrong. If I did last night's speech here, by now you would have all been walking out. And if I did tonight's speech there, I would have been criticized by being slightly radical. But we're having a good time doing it this way, right? Because we are finally putting America first. Under my administration, America's borders are more secure than ever before. We ended the catch and release, stopped asylum fraud. And we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens. We've already built 300 miles of border wall and we're adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be completed. And our numbers on the border are the best they've ever been. And by the way, Mexico is paying for the wall. Just in case you didn't know that. They don't know that. They're paying for the wall. You haven't noticed on the wall. Everything was wall, wall. They didn't think I was going to get it done. Because look, you have one major party controlling Congress and they don't want to give me a wall. So they're going crazy. ""Wall. The wall's not getting done."" Then I get it done. Get it from the military, get it from everything. I'm a developer. I know how to get money. It's one of those. Developers understand. And now that the wall is almost complete, it'll be soon complete. And it's the wall that border security wanted so badly. This is the one. But now that it's built, you never hear about the wall. They don't talk about it anymore. They don't talk about it anymore. It's incredible. But the wall will soon be complete. We've invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in nearly 75 years. The space force. And Al, in honor of you, we have passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, Al. That guy's been bugging me for years. Al has been bugging me. What's in that hat, Al? Let me see. Let me… It's something. Al, he's been bugging me for years. Did you ever think we'd get VA Choice, VA Accountability? Did you ever really believe it? Thank you, Al. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, a disaster. $150 billion we paid Iran for a basically short term deal. And we gave them… What's more impressive, we also gave them $1.8 billion in cash. Cash. Many plane loads. You know what that took? Many, many plane loads, $1.8 billion. I said bad. That's when I realized how powerful a president is in the United States. When a president has the right, which by the way, I don't believe he did have that right, okay? When a president has the right to go into the banks and take out $1.8 billion and hand it to people that hate our guts, that's power. That's power. I don't believe he had the right to do it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the US embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East in 25 years. You saw that just last week. UAE, highly respected. Mohamed, highly respected. UAE and Israel. And now they're all going to be coming in. Now they're all saying, ""How come you didn't tell us about this?"" You'll have peace in the Middle East. And yet we're moving our trips out. It's pretty amazing, actually. We'll get no credit for it, but that's all right. Remember that Kaitlan. Cover that properly, Kaitlan. We like Kaitlan. Together, we've spent the last four years cleaning up 47 years of Biden disasters. Joe Biden has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. He supported NAFTA. China's entry. He's done so many things. This man, if you look at what he's done, we went into a deal, the Korea, you know about the Korea deal? Hillary Clinton's deal, along with Biden. They promised 250,000 jobs, right? 250,000 jobs. And they were right. Except all those jobs went to South Korea. They didn't come to us. 00, the polls close. And they said, ""Donald Trump has won the state of Texas."" Simultaneously with the closing. I'm now running in Texas against a man who's against oil, guns, and God. How do you win Texas? I said this, you could bring George Washington back as your Presidential candidate. You could bring Abraham Lincoln. Let's put him as the Vice Presidential candidate. Run in Texas and other states, you couldn't win. You couldn't win. Now, they're not going to win. We're going to win this. And you're against the oil stuff too. Because his whole thing on oil, no fracking, no this, no that. New England has the highest energy costs in the United States. And you know why? Because Governor Cuomo will not let a pipeline go across the tip of New York State so that oil and gas, of which we have plenty, can come. And do you know where you buy your energy from? Russia. Did you know that? You have ships, much of it from Russia, because Governor Cuomo, New York won't allow a pipeline and they're desperate to have something happen in upper New York State. And those are great people, but they've been treated very badly. But they won't allow a pipeline. By not allowing a pipeline, we're trying to do it through essentially eminent domain. By not allowing a pipeline to go through upper New York State and create a lot of jobs for them, you have the highest energy prices in the United States by far. Thank you New York. Thank you. Thank you Governor Cuomo. Biden voted for the Iraq war. I was against the Iraq war. He opposed a mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani. You remember that one? He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and for the world. That's not a positive development. Before they went into the WTO, China was flat lined. For years and years and decades, flat lined. And then they got into the WTO and a lot of bad things happened. First China's stole our jobs, plundered our intellectual property and unleashed the virus. And now China is trying to just hug and kiss Joe Biden. They want him so badly. Look, if you like China, you should vote for Biden, that I can tell you. How about his son? You think the son, maybe there's a conflict? How about his son? Where's Hunter? Where is Hunter? Where is Hunter? Does anybody know? Where's Hunter? He's in another country right now, probably, ripping off another country. No, as soon as Biden became vice president, bad things happened with respect to a Hunter. If that happened with respect to my family, I wouldn't be standing. I guarantee you that. I guarantee you that. What a disgrace. What a disgrace. Ukraine. And it's not just Ukraine and it's not just China. But he goes into China, takes out $1.5 billion to manage, and he knows nothing, and he wasn't even employed. He got thrown out of the armed services. So give me a break. It's a disgrace, what's happening. There's a double… There's a thing happening with the media like nobody's ever seen before. These people right here. Because if that happened to a Republican, in particular. If any of that stuff happened to me, it would be brutal. But it happened to him. They don't want to talk about it. And how about the questions asked by Anderson Cooper yesterday? Anderson Cooper. He's interviewed me a lot over the years and I always got along with him, but they were tough interviews. Did you hear the questions? And Biden kept looking down. I think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter. Right? I think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter. And that's happened before. And how about David Muir of ABC? He's a nice guy, right? How soft were those questions? How soft were those? They don't ask me questions like that. They got fire pouring out of their eyes. No. ""Mr. Vice President, what do you think of this? How was your breakfast, sir? Did you enjoy it?"" When I banned travel from China Biden, called it hysterical and xenophobic. He even used, somewhere along the line, the word racist. He always figures, they always want to get that word in there. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. But instead my decision, saved thousands and thousands of lives. And then we banned Europe very early because I saw what was going on, really in Italy and Spain and France. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Mike Pence did a great job. We produced more than 100,000 ventilators within weeks. And not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, not one. You heard all about, and now we're producing ventilators. Hard to produce. Expensive, complex. We're producing them now for the rest of the world. 188 countries were affected by this. We pioneered advances in treatment that have reduced the monthly rate. And you look at this, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since April. Think of that. 85% since April. Under Operation Warp Speed, three different vaccines are right now in final stage trials. If you go back three years, that would have been something that would have been impossible to even discuss. It would have taken years. We will produce a vaccine this year and together we will defeat the virus. It's already getting defeated. And by the way, another big Democrat hoax. Another big hoax. I want football back. I'm the one that's been saying. Is that a correct statement? I want football back. These are young, strong guys. They're not going to be affected by the virus. If you look at it, it's generally older people. Older people that have heart conditions, that have diabetes, that have problems. These are big strong guys. They'll be just fine. But I want football back. I've been calling for football to be back, including Big 10. Big 10, get with it. Open up your season, Big 10. And the Dems don't want it back for political reasons. But now their new line… This is like Russia, Russia, Russia. All this crap they come up with. Now their new line is they are trying to blame me and keep football shut down. They want to keep it shut down. And they're saying that President Trump shut it down. I'm the one that wants it open. So they're reversing it. They're playing a big con game. It's just a con game. And that's what we're dealing with. And we have to defeat them on November 3rd. I want football back and Big 10 open. And now the other day, Joe Biden came up with a plan to impose a blanket shutdown. He'd be willing to do another blanket. And we had to do it. We blanket, we shut down. We saved millions of lives. Instead of the number we have today, 175,000, we could have had 2 million today instead. It would have been unacceptable, unsustainable. Unsustainable. We did everything right. We did it right. We closed it down. We stopped China. We stopped Europe. Now we're opening it up and we're opening it up to record numbers, despite the fact that the Democrats are keeping their states shut down and hurting people that live in those states, shut down as long as possible. But now Biden wants to do another blanket shutdown, possibly, that would decimate the economy and cause suicides, drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, heart attacks, joblessness. You'd have jobs, all of the problems that it causes. Because it's not just a one sided equation. A shut down causes big problems also. And at this point, when the economy is roaring back. We had record job numbers this last quarter, over 9 million jobs. We're going to throw that all out? We have a market… You know, your stock market. Who has 401k's here? Your 401k's and your stocks, when you have stocks, would be obliterated. And right now, we have just, on two of your markets, as you know, S&P and NASDAQ, you're at new records. And you're about to hit another new record. Think of it. Who would have thought the stock market? And hopefully we're at the end of this horrible China virus. Came from China. They should have stopped it and they did. But who would have thought, just who would have thought that the stock market is at record levels right now? Record levels. And everything else is going to follow. Before the virus, we created an economic miracle and now we're doing it again. We did the Paycheck Protection Program where we saved more than 200,000 jobs in New Hampshire alone. 200,000, right? Over the past three months, we've gained so many different, if you look at retail numbers. Take a look at our retail numbers. They're literally at records. Look at some of the numbers be announced by companies. They're at records. Can you imagine giving that all up and starting again? It's not acceptable. If I'm reelected, we will create 10 million jobs over the next 10 months, and we'll do that easily. The Biden agenda, with big tax increases and big regulation increases, would immediately kill everything. You will go into a depression. And I'm very good at predicting this. You will go into a depression the likes of which this country has not seen since 1929, and who knows, maybe worse than that. They are playing a suicide mission. … be worse than that. They are playing a suicide mission if they want to raise your taxes. They want to raise your taxes by $4 trillion. And that's going to be almost everybody. They're saying for the rich. No, not for the rich. They're going to be raising everybody's taxes almost. Joe Biden is running on the most extreme far left platform of any nominee in American history and of our foreign adversaries, we're devising a plan to destroy the United States from within. All they have to look is at the Biden Harris. How about her? Is she a beauty? What a beauty that is. They pick a woman who starts off… She starts off sort of strong. She's one of the favorites. Within a period of a few months, she goes down, down 15, 12, 11, nine, eight, five, three, two. Then she goes, ""I'm going to leave because I've decided that I want to leave. I want to leave."" She left because she wouldn't have gotten any votes. She was terrible. This would be your president possibly. I don't think so. I don't think so. I want to see the first woman president also, but I don't want to see a woman president get into that position the way she do it and she's not competent. She's not competent. They're all saying we want Ivanka. I don't blame them. They want to eliminate America's borders in the middle of a pandemic, suspend all deportations, restore catch and release, and expand horrible, dangerous, disgusting sanctuary cities. They want to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers. That's what we need is more lawyers. Let's get some more lawyers into the act. They want to end national security travel bands from jihadist nations, very dangerous, and increase refugee admissions by 700%. This is in the Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, you know crazy Bernie. A lot of his people are going to vote for me just like they did last time. You know why? Because of trade. Because I agree with Bernie Sanders, but my trade policies are much tougher than his and I'm able to do it. All you have to do is how is China doing last year with my trade policy? Not too well. And we had the best year we've ever had. We're going to get a lot of Bernie Sanders voters because they like my attitude on trade. They really like it because I've been telling people for years our country is being ripped off by China and many other countries, including, I hate to say it, our allies. Our allies have been ripping us big. And you heard me say last night, NATO, I got $130 billion from them first time going up to $400 billion a year from NATO countries, by saying, ""You got to do it. You got to do it."" And general Secretary Stoltenberg said it can't be done. He could not believe it. He's actually my biggest fan and nobody ever calls him for a quote. Call him sometime. They want to abolish cash bail and cut funding for law enforcement. They want to end… We want to increase law enforcement, not cut law enforcement. And by the way, Pat Lynch is a great guy, New York, New York. Really great, New York's finest, right? Their rights have been taken away from them. Literally they're not allowed to do their job, but Pay Lynch, he said the first time in history that they know of New York's finest have endorsed a candidate. The candidate is Donald Trump. First time they've done it. All over the country, the sheriffs of Florida, all of Texas, all over the country, Ohio, law enforcement's endorsing Trump. I cannot imagine them getting any law enforcement endorsements. If they do, please let me know and we'll have a little discussion. We'll ask why did that happen? They want to end school choice and ban charter schools. They want to abolish American energy, including all of the things I said before. And add to that coal and add to that shale. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a bright future, the American dream for all Americans. There is no limit to what we can achieve with four more years. So in conclusion, I have to say this. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world that's happening already. We will end our reliance on China once and for all. We'll do it here. Like we used to do in the good old days before we owed trillions of dollars. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and neighborhoods and ban sanctuary cities. We will kill our terrorist's enemies as we've been doing while keeping America out of the endless foreign Wars. I go to Dover and I greet these incredible families of soldiers that have been so sadly killed. So sadly killed. It's such a shame. I go to the hospital, I go to Walter Reed Medical Center. It's incredible. The doctors are so talented. I see what they can do, but soldiers so badly hurt. And they're really acting as police. They're acting as police. Now, we're very low in Afghanistan now in terms of numbers of troops. We're getting out. We'll be getting out soon. We're very low in Iraq. We're very low in Syria, except we kept the oil. We left some behind for the oil. If you don't mind, we kept the oil. We should have kept the oil in Iraq like I've been saying. We'll appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda, which is what we have in many cases right now. The next president will be in my opinion, responsible for two, three, four, and maybe, maybe even five US Supreme Court Justices. You better vote for me, you better vote for me or you're going to have the greatest depression you've ever seen. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Second amendment. We will surprise medical billing require, it's already done. I signed it. Nobody can believe I did it. Price transparency. You know what that is? Do you know how big that is? Where you're able to actually negotiate with hospitals, see their prices, compare it. You know who likes it? Good hospitals and good doctors. Other people don't like it. It's the biggest thing and nobody even talks about it, but I've already put it into effect. The bad news is it goes into effect on January 1st. You better make sure you elect me so I get credit for it. Otherwise, could you imagine if sleepy Joe got in and medical prices and drug prices and everything had dropped, but he said, ""I wonder what happened?"" And I did it all. I'll be so angry at New Hampshire. I'll never speak to you again. Now, all these things, what we're doing with drugs, we instituted a favored nations laws. We instituted favored nations. That's going to drop your prices 50, 60, 70%. And I'm the only president in 51 years, last year, drug prices went down a little, not much, but they went down the first time in 51 years. Favored nations could drop at 50, 60, or 70%. On top of that, I instituted rebates where the rebates go toward price reductions and back to the customer instead of to a middleman. So we will protect Medicare and we will protect Social Security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful American flag. Do we love our American flag? Or Mars. Above all, we will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history and be inspired by the words of the New Hampshire state motto. Have you ever heard of these words? Live free or die. Live free or die. Vote for those people. And you do, you have a great governor. Vote for your people, vote for your governor. You have a great governor. From Portsmouth to Dixville from Concord to Keene. I know a friend from Keene. Great guy. I had a friend from Keene a long time. Keene, New Hampshire. And Merrimack to Manchester, we will fight for every job, every family and every neighborhood. We will fight for every vote. We have to win. We have no choice. Can I be honest with you? We're working hard. We're all working. I don't have to do this. I could get off that beautiful plane that used to be black and white with a red stripe. That was mine. But that's Air Force one. I get off that beautiful plane. I could come up and say, ""Ladies and gentlemen of New Hampshire, you have no choice. You have to vote for me because if you don't, you'll be put in radical lefties. You'll have a depression. Your stocks will be worthless. Your 401ks will be gone. There'll be crime all over your streets. So I'm not going to work at all. I'm leaving now, but you have to vote for me because you have no choice."" Right? I could say it. Right? Right? We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trail, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads. Won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the greatest nation in the history of the world and we are making it greater. We will be greater than ever before. Incredible citizens like you, the people of New Hampshire, helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are not going to let the radical left socialists or communists take our country. We're not going to let it. We're returning power to you the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one nation under God. And we don't take the beautiful word God out of our Pledge of Allegiance, do we? They did it twice. They it twice. Then they say, ""Well, we didn't mean that."" Oh, I see. I was listening once they said, ""That's right."" You don't know what it is, what happened? What happened? They did it on purpose. They did it twice. That's where they're coming from. You can be fools and you can be fooled, but that's where they're coming from. So don't be surprised, but they're not going to get there. We're not going to let it happen. We're not going to let our country be destroyed by a bunch of nut jobs. America will soon be thriving like never before and together with the people of New Hampshire that have meant so much to me, and I brought down opioid and I brought down drug problems for you by 19% and nobody even talks about it. 19. I talk about New Hampshire a lot because you had one of the proportionally worst problems of any country, of any state in this incredible country. You had one of the worst problems of any of the states. And I talk about you a lot. It was incredible. And you still have. But we brought it down 19% and people are absolutely shocked. If it weren't for the China plague, the number would be 25 or 30%. That really hurt us because people sort of went back to some old ways because they don't want to be shut down any longer. Joe, don't you understand that? They don't want to be shut down. So I worked very hard on that for this state and for other states, but this was a state that was so severely impacted with the drug problem. That wall is stopping them and it's stopping them like never before. It's stopping them like never before. I want to thank New Hampshire for all you've done for me. I want to thank New Hampshire. You were my first victory, as I said, but you are going to lead a nation to the most important victory and the most important election that we've ever had. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you."
Trump,"Hello, Manchester, and I am thrilled to be in the great state of New Hampshire with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family, and country. Thank you. Thank you. And I'll tell you what — we have more in this arena, and I hate to say this to you… we have more than this outside of the arena trying to get in. So if you'd like to give up your seat or where you're standing… Sorry we couldn't get you seats, but if you want to give it up, let them come in, you go out. Does anybody want to make that deal? I don't think so. But we have more in this arena and outside of this arena than all of the other candidates, meaning the Democrats, put together and multiplied times fave. And the fake news, these guys will never report that. They'll never report it. They don't even like showing the crowd. They always show my face. They never show the crowd. But you know what? The people can hear the crowd. The people can hear the crowd. They know. That is not the sound of 200 people. One of their prime candidates today, they worked a big deal. They had exactly 104 people, and the fake news said, ""It was a nice crowd. Very nice."" If I had one empty seat here, one empty seat in this massive arena, they'd say, ""He didn't sell out."" But you know what? We have never had an empty seat from the day your future first lady and I came down the escalator. Never, not one time. And we have the biggest arenas in the country. With your help on November 3rd we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats. We are going to win New Hampshire in a landslide. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy we've ever had, the most prosperity. We have got the most prosperity we've ever had. By the way, we're going to keep it that way, too, if it's okay, who was mumbling, very distracting, very distracting. It's true. You know, it was very distracting. I'm speaking and a woman is mumbling terribly behind me, angry. There was a little anger back there. We're the ones that should be angry, not them. We're the ones that should be angry, but we proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. Our country is stronger today than ever before. And the day after my address, our good Republicans in the United States Senate voted to reject the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax and to issue a full, complete, and absolute, total acquittal. And it ,wasn't even close and I want to thank our Republican senators and our Republican House members. They were tremendous. In the House, we won 196 to nothing and then we got three Democrats. And in the Senate, other than Romney, we got 52 to nothing, 52 to nothing. That's something, and in one case we got 53 to nothing, but I don't even count that to be honest. The radical left's pathetic partisan crusade has completely failed and utterly backfired with 18 votes… think of that… 18 votes to spare, with a lot of votes to spare. And also very importantly, as of today, I… we, because it's not we. It's not I. It's we. We're all in this together. We have the highest poll numbers that we have ever had. Thank you, Nancy, very much. Thank you. While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with this vile hoax, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our borders, and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. From our rural communities to our cities, we are expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens. We added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. Amazing. And I listened. I watched. I had all these experts. They were saying, ""Yes, I think 60,000."" Another one said 101,000. Another one said 125. Another one was 118. And then the number came out, 225,000. Pretty good. Pretty good. We have destroyed the ISIS caliphate. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS. Al-Baghdadi is dead. Al-Baghdadi is dead, and we just took out the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. The fact is, America is respected again. It's been a long time. But as we keep on winning, Washington democrats keep on losing their minds. They're crazy. That's why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement. They're joining our great Republican party. Now, I can't tell you what's happening tomorrow because you know you have some pretty strange election laws here, right? Remember last time? We won the primary tremendously. We should have won the election, but they had buses being shipped up from Massachusetts, hundreds and hundreds of buses. And it was very, very close even though they did, but this year we have a great governor, Governor Sununu. Great governor, Chris. And now you get prosecuted if you do what they did, so it should be a lot different. But we have done great. This has been an incredible state for us. It's a state where the people are great, just great people. And we hear that there could be because you have crossovers in primaries, don't you? So I hear a lot of Republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the Democrats. Does that make sense? You people wouldn't do that. My only problem is I'm trying to figure out who is their weakest candidate? I think they're all weak if you want to know the truth. We proudly welcome and embrace voters of all parties and political persuasions who want to join our mission. A very simple mission, remember? Make America great again. And then after we make it great again, which we already have… We've had 141 days where the stock markets have reached their all-time historical high. 141, think about it. Out of three years, 141. And to me, I view it differently. Well, look at your 401ks. I mean, who is doing well with their 401k? Up 90%. Up 104%. Is there anybody doing badly with the 401k? I'd like to not talk to that person. Does anybody have a 401k where they're doing badly, please? Oh, don't put up your hand. I don't believe it. Nah, the 401ks, they're up 90%, 95%. I always tell this story. People come up to me. They say, ""I want to thank you. My wife thinks I'm a total loser, sir. She thinks I am the worst person with money, with financial. She thinks I'm just horrible. In the last three years, I'm up 94%, sir. She thinks I'm a total genius when it comes to finance. She loves me again. She didn't love me before, sir. She loves me again."" That tells you something about money, doesn't it? The first step to victory in November is tomorrow. Go send a message that Republicans… And you can vote for the weakest candidate if you want. Don't worry about it. I don't really think we actually have a candidate against us… that Republicans are energized, that we're united, and that nine months from now we are going to take back the House of Representatives. We are going to hold the Senate and we are going to keep the White House. You know, they always talk about the Democrats. They have enthusiasm, right? We have so much more enthusiasm than them. It's not even close. They're all fighting each other. They're all going after each other. You got them all over the place. They don't know what the hell they're doing. They don't know what they're doing. They can't even count their votes. We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many great leaders from across this state and this country, great national leaders. I want to thank our tremendous Vice President, Mike Pence, who spoke earlier this evening. And also with us, our warrior senators, the two people that wanted to be here. They're going to be here tomorrow. They're going to be here to get out the vote. I don't think we have to worry too much about it, but that's okay… And very highly respected, Senators Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul. Great guys. Warriors, they're warriors. Hey, Lindsay and Rand. That's not bad. Can you imagine if you actually came from New Hampshire what it would be? Right? That's not bad, but they have been great. All they do is they looked at everybody for the last couple of months and they said, ""Read the transcripts please. Read the transcripts."" But I want to thank you both very much. Two great people, two great friends. Man, look at all that television back there. Whoa! That's bigger than those terrible Academy Awards, I've got to tell you. That used to be big. Not so much anymore. A friend of mine, another great leader and somebody that's going to be Speaker of the House hopefully next year, Kevin McCarthy. Our leader, Kevin McCarthy. Oh, will that be nice to have Kevin, a pro. You'll see things get done like you'll never believe. Thank you, Kevin, very much. Great. A very brave man… He took a bullet. He got shot and he got up. He was going to die that night. I tell this story all the time. His wife, she was crying so much. When he finally did awake, I said, ""Well, one thing I learned, your wife loves you."" ""Why do you say that?"" ""Because she was devastated."" I know many wives that don't get too upset. His wife was devastated. His family was devastated. The doctor told me he didn't have a good chance, but he's tough as hell and he's a really terrific friend. He's a winner. He put himself back into shape. He actually looks better now than he did before he got shot. Steve Scalise. Lot of guts. Your NRCC Chairman, Mr, Tom Emmer. Congressman, thank you. Tom Emmer. Thank you, Tom. And Representatives Mark Meadows. Did anybody ever hear of Mark Meadows? These are warriors. Matt Gates. Matt. Whoa! Not bad, Matt. That's not bad. Mike Johnson, great lawyer. Mike Johnson. Thank you, Mike. And a man with a very familiar last name, Greg Pence, the brother of Mike. Thank you. Thank you, Greg. And thanks also to New Hampshire Senate Republican leader, Chuck Morse. Thank you, Chuck. Thank you. And I see somebody, two great people, a great couple in the audience, Matt Schlapp and Mercedes Schlapp. They are warriors also. They're warriors also. And I see next to them, two warriors. Corey, you just are such a fighter. You are such a fighter. Ah, boy, if we could get him to run for Senate, he would win so easily. Corey Lewandowski, who loves this state a lot. And Dave Bossie. Thank you, David. Thank you, David. Great job. I'm just picking these people out of the audience. We have everybody here. The New Hampshire House Republican leader, Dick Hinch. Thank you, Dick. Thank you, Dick. A man who's been with us right from the beginning… When I left here last time, I felt so good. Everybody coming up to the room, ""you're going to win. You're going to…"" We win by a lot, right? We had actually a total of 18, and we won. We had a tremendous night and I've never forgotten it. And there was a friend of ours, Chairman of the New Hampshire Republican party, Steve Stepanek. Steve Stepanek. That was a big evening. And three friends of mine that are co-chairmen, Al Baldasaro, Fred Doucette… Baldasaro, Fred Ducette, and Lou Gargiulo. Thank you all very much. And David and Corey, thank you also for being here. Also a woman that not too many people know. Very powerful, very smart, very beautiful even though I'm not allowed to say that because she's my daughter, Ivanka. Fred Ducette and Lou Gargiulo. Thank you all very much. And David and Corey, thank you also for being here. Also a woman that not too many people know. Very powerful, very smart, very beautiful, even though I'm not allowed to say that because she's my daughter, Ivanka. Come here. Come on up, Ivanka. And Jared who's making deals that are so good for this country, people have no idea what's happening. I will tell you, we are making trade deals and other deals the likes of which nobody's ever seen before. Jared Kushner. Thank you, Jared. Thank you. And Kimberly, thank you so much. I heard your speech on the plane on the way in. I was very impressed. And did Don Jr. make a good speech? Come on. They're good kids. They went through a lot with this hoax, I want to tell you. They went through a lot with the hoax. Helping us was the RNC chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel. Great job. I said, ""Get me the woman from Michigan to head up the RNC! Who's that woman from Michigan to head up the RNC?"" Thank you, Ronna. Great job. Setting all kinds of records, polling records, contribution records, everything. We're doing everything so it's great. And Tommy Hicks. I want you to say hello, Tommy Hicks, who's a special friend. And Haley. Thank you, darling. I retweeted you, Haley. I retweeted you all over the place. And all together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere in the world. It's a great thing. It's a great thing. Since my election, America's gained 7 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has hit the lowest rate in half a century. The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. You believe that one? That's pretty amazing. That's pretty amazing. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows, all time, never been lower than what it is now. And by the way, our poll numbers with African Americans, with Hispanic Americans, with Asian Americans, the other side is getting a little nervous because they are like rocket ships. They're going up. African American youth unemployment is so important. It was a horrible number a few years ago. You remember, it was a really terrible thing was happening. It's just reached the lowest time in the history, lowest, the best number in the history of our country. And African American poverty numbers have hit the lowest rate ever recorded. Wages for African American workers have increased by $2,400 per year, also a record. And you know this. For decades, the Democrat party has betrayed African Americans. They betrayed us all. They betrayed all of us. But we're delivering for African Americans. We're delivering for Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans like nobody has ever done. We are fighting for great jobs, great schools, great healthcare, and a truly great future for our country and for them. We are the party of equal opportunity for all Americans. Thank you. To support working families, we've reduced the cost of childcare, expanded paid leave, and given 40 million American families an average of $2,200 more in their pockets thanks to the Republican child tax credit. Who would have thought that? We have cut more job killing regulations than any… You know this one. So you go back four years, eight years. In one case, longer than eight years. We've cut more job killing regulations than any other administration in the history of our country, and we're not finished. We've ended the war on American energy. They want to take our energy away. They want to take our wealth away. They want to give us wind. Wind. If it blows, wonderful. If it doesn't blow, you got problems. Wind. They want to destroy our countrysides, put windmills all over them. Watch your house go down in value. You ever see what happens? They build a windmill within distance of your house. You could forget about your house. You could just say, well, that was the end of that investment. You want to see a bird graveyard, go to the bottom of a windmill. Take a look. It's a graveyard for birds. They kill all the birds. Lowering utility bills and reducing prices at the pump, that's what we're doing. We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies, Washington politicians… You know this. They shuttered New Hampshire factories. You were one of the worst examples ever. NAFTA, what NAFTA to your communities, I mean to your state, is incredible. Shattered your communities and sacrifice your jobs on the altar of globalism. We can forget globalism. We want to take care of our country. New Hampshire alone lost one in four manufacturing jobs following that twin disaster of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO, the World Trade Organization, one of the truly bad deals ever made in the history of our country. For decades, politicians campaigned across this state promising to replace NAFTA. They lied. They never did it. They never even tried to do it. They wouldn't have been able to anyway. It wasn't easy, I will tell you that. But then they got elected and they did absolutely nothing. But I'm not like those other politicians. I keep my promises. We took care of it. We took care of it. You saw last month being bye-bye. I say Donald J. Trump, bye-bye NAFTA. We ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new US Mexico Canada Agreement into law. That's going to be great for our manufacturers, our farmers. Great for everybody. Great for our workers. The USMCA will bring jobs back to New Hampshire right where they belong. They should have never left in the first place. Probably the number one reason I ran for office. I'm one for one. I have friends. Some of these great senators, look at Lindsey over there and look at Rand. These great senators. Sure, I've run five times and I've won three. And other senators said ""Sir, I've won seven times, sir."" Southern senator. ""I won seven times, sir, and I've won five of those damn contests."" I said, ""Senator, I ran once and I won just once."" And we're going to run twice and that's going to be it. Although they think we're going to run much more than that, you know that, right? It scares the hell out of the fake news, I will tell you. They can't take a joke. I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs, and our strategy worked. Massive tariff and tariff money is pouring in and has poured in, poured in by the billions and billions. We never took in 25 cents from China. They ripped us so much you wouldn't believe it. Now they respect us again. Last month we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defeat so many of our opponents. The money that's pouring in, people don't even believe it. And by the way, the virus, they're working hard. Looks like by April, in theory when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. I hope that's true, but we're doing great in our country. China, I spoke with president Xi and they're working very, very hard and I think it's going to all work out fine. Rough stuff, I tell you. Rough, rough stuff, but I think it's going to work out good. We only have 11 cases and they're all getting better. But our trade agreement with China will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and substantially boost exports of American made goods. Is that nice? After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. On no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than a thing called immigration, right? Before I came into office, the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country and that's what they want. I see them campaigning right down the street. It's really boring to watch, but I try and watch. No, I have an obligation to watch really boring stuff. But they want open borders. They want thousands and thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom are not exactly what we're looking for, okay? I mean murderers, rapists, and some other things. They're going to be poisoning our children with drugs, including right here in New Hampshire, and you have one of the drug problems in the country. And we brought it down 18% but we have to do better. 18%. Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. They want to let anyone into our country from all around the world. Just come on in, folks, we're going to give you free healthcare. We're going to give you free education. We're going to give you more than our vets are getting. Every family will get a free Rolls Royce. You know I said that, Matt. I said that to them and some of the fake news picked it up and they said, ""President Trump said every family coming into our country illegally gets a brand new free Rolls Royce. He lied. He lied. He lied."" They gave me a Pinocchio. They don't get it, Matt, do they, Matt? Actually they get it better than we understand. They get it very well. They get it. They know what's happening. And the wall is being built. I will tell you the wall is being built. And you know they went after us on everybody knows the wall is going up. So what's happening? You do know who's paying for the wall, don't you? Right. Redemption from illegal aliens that are coming. The redemption money is paying for the wall. They're so sad to hear that because it's okay, finally, they go. You have to understand an entire party is fighting. They'll give me anything I want. Our military would rebuilt it. 2.2, it's really $2.5 trillion over a period of three years. They give me anything but not 25 cents for the wall. They said, ""We like drones."" Well, drones don't keep people out. Drones are wonderful. They fly around, take pictures. We're going to give you a drone. No good. So we now have built over 100 miles of wall. And when we have that wall built, you have to see what happens to the illegal aliens that don't come in. I say they can't come in. They don't come in. So we up to over a hundred, substantially more than a hundred miles of wall, and we'll have close to 500 miles of wall in the very near future. And by the way, you have to see. You wouldn't believe it. You have to see what happens when that wall goes up. You have to see the numbers change like magic. They change like magic. You ever hear the thing with all the modern technology, all of the new computers, the new genius, the new everything, cyber this, cyber that, two things never change, right? A wheel and a wall. Right? A wheel and a wall. They're going to have a lot of brilliant people working over the years. They're never going to replace the wheel and they're never going to replace the wall, and it's a high wall. Illegal immigrants coming in, coming into our country illegally, very few of them are getting in right now. Mexico has been terrific. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border and the numbers went down 87% from this year and this time last year. And for the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild the cities in America. We could rebuild our cities. But I have something, because people were screaming to me for the last four or five rallies, read the snake. The snake. Does anybody know what I'm talking about? She knows. She's been standing outside for four days, no wonder. And you look good, I'll tell you what. Four days outside in the rain and snow. Look at these front row people. These are warriors. They're warriors too, like my congressmen and senators. I made minor changes. They mentioned illegal immigration. This is about immigration. This was a song from the 1950s, Al Green. And they mentioned little changes to it, that's okay. But they mentioned illegal immigration, right? And I used to do this a lot and people couldn't get enough of it, to be honest with you. And I haven't done it for a while, and I thought I'd do it tonight because you're on the eve of giving us an opponent and all of these people want open borders. They want open borders, and we don't want open borders. We want very strong closed borders. And we want people to come into our country, but they want to come in through merit and we want them to come in legally, right? Right? Through merit and legally. Right? So we'll do this quickly. This is illegal immigration. It's called… Oh, listen to how quiet it is. Listen to how quiet. Now watch how quiet it gets. Gets so quiet. But this is all about… I love you too. That was a guy that said that, but I love him too. I love everybody. Ready? So important. Illegal immigration. On our way to work one morning down the path along the lake, a tender hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. ""Poor thing,"" she cried, ""I'll take you in and I'll take care of you."" Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk. She hurried home from work that night and as soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she'd taken in had been fully, fully revived. Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed that vicious snake. She clutched him to her bosom. ""You're so beautiful,"" she cried. ""But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you truly would have died."" She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, the snake gave her a vicious bite. Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake. ""I saved you,"" cried the woman, ""and you've bitten me, but why? You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die."" ""Shut up, silly woman,"" said the reptile with a grin. ""You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in."" Got to come in legally and through merit. Under my administration we're fully taking care of our own citizens first, including millions of African American and Hispanic Americans who are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities. In this region of the country alone last year, ICE officers… We love our ICE officers. The Democrats don't like them. The Democrats don't like them. ICE officers are the toughest human beings, and they love the country as much as anybody in this room. Last year alone they … in this room. Last year alone, they arrested over 2,000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. Over 2,000 accused of murder, yet left wing politicians support sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into the American community. One of guests at the State of the Union was American citizen, Jody Jones. I introduced him that night. His beloved brother, Rocky, was murdered by a criminal alien in California, shot him eight times at close range, wouldn't stop. Rocky's killer had been previously arrested many, many times, but under California's totally insane and outrageous sanctuary law, authorities were ordered to set him free. Tragically, left wing politicians in New Hampshire tried to replicate California's disastrous policies. Last year, the Democrat controlled New Hampshire house blocked legislation that would have banned sanctuary cities in your state. And by the way, you have a great governor, Chris Sununu. He's on top of it. He's on top of it. And his father is a great guy. His father didn't like me too much a few years ago. Once I won, I'm telling you, he was so good. He was as good. He fought like hell for us, all of us. It's a great family, and Chris is doing a fantastic job. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote Republican in 2020, November. And thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down now at record numbers and we've ended catch and release. You know what catch and release is? You catch an illegal alien by law. You then take his name and address. They don't have addresses. What's your address? What? They don't have addresses. They come into the country, they don't have addresses. So you take his name and then you have to release him into the country and you say, ""We'll see you in four years for your court case."" We never see them. They never come back. We have seized record amounts of drugs. We have deported record numbers of gang members, MS-13 by the thousands. And we have done more to secure the border of our country than any administration in history. … Does anybody know who won Iowa? I don't know. Maybe Rander, Lindsey. Grant, does anybody know who won? Lindsey, you're a total pro. Nobody knows. He said nobody. Flip a coin. Flip a coin. Flip a coin. They're going to run your health care. Unbelievable. Nobody knows who won. Actually, I think they're trying to take it away from Bernie again. I think Bernie came in second. Can you believe it? They're doing it to you again, Bernie. They're doing it to you again. We're saving your healthcare while these socialist Democrats are trying to take away your healthcare. We are making healthcare better and much, much cheaper. You've seen what we did. We are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will. The Republican party always will. Always will. And we got rid of the most unpopular thing in the healthcare world, the individual mandate. We had to pay a fortune not to have pay a fortune. You paid a fortune not to pay a fortune for bad healthcare. And we got rid of it, saved a lot of money for a lot of people. And we're stopping surprise medical bills and making everything transparent. That's bigger than healthcare transparency and that'll go unfortunately into effect right around the election time. It would be nice if we could get it earlier, but it's all done. It's all signed. Because when providers are required to show you what the prices are, those prices are going to come tumbling down. Blood tests as an example, one hospital has them for $53. Another hospital, the same test, $2,415. Same exact test. And it may even be better, who knows? We're approving more generic drugs than ever before at any time in the history of our country. That's bringing prices down. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan. Remember President Obama, you could keep your plan. You could keep 28 times. You can keep your doctor. That didn't turn out very good. We should impeach him for that. Why aren't we impeaching him? 28 times, you can keep your doctor. We should impeach President Obama. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right? Abraham Lincoln. Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. We love people. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. People are signing up left and right. But if you want to vote for a weak candidate tomorrow, go ahead. Pick one. Pick the weakest one you think, I don't know who it is. We are a big party with big ideas for the future. Very big. We become a big party and an open-minded party and we're the party that people like. We're the hot party and we're the party with all the enthusiasm. We are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. Right? We pass criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Most incredible thing that's happened. Prisoners never really had a shot. They'd get out, they couldn't get a job no matter what they did, and they'd go back. They'd go back to their ways. I mean, in many cases I guess they had no choice. It was a disaster. Now they're getting out and because our economy is so good and because of what we've done with criminal justice reform and other things like opportunities, zones, et cetera, they're getting jobs and employers are loving them. They're doing great. They're doing great. They are doing great first time ever. They're not going back. To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. And as you know, we've also confirmed two great new Supreme Court justices. Thank you very much. Thank you, Grant. Thank you, Lindsey. Thank you. We have invested $2.2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, as I said, and I love saying it because we are funding for New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Army National Guard readiness centers just a few miles from here in Pembroke and in Concord. Concord, I love Concord. I love Concord. Oh, Concord. You know how famous Concord is? Concord. That's the same Concord that we read about all the time, right? Concord. I love Concord. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, been trying to do that for 52 years. We got it done. And for years you watched as your politicians … They really, I mean, they went out, ""I'd like to apologize for the behavior of the United States."" No, no. We don't know we don't apologize anymore. We don't apologize. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of New Hampshire. Thank you. At stake in our present battle is to survival actually of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory November 3rd, 2020. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And I will tell you, that swamp is much worse than I thought when I was out here innocently campaigning. Let's drain the swamp. That swamp is a lot worse than anybody ever thought. That swamp is that dirty swamp. That's a dirty swamp. You have some really evil, dirty, horrible people. Like to say nice, everyone's nice. They're not good. They're not good people. But we're draining that sucker slowly but surely. With your help, we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. How about that? It'll be done. We will land the first woman in the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant its flag on Mars. We're very advanced. All made in the USA. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to- … keep and bear arms. We're going to protect your Second Amendments. By the way, they're going to take away everything. They're going to take away your wealth. They're going to take away your guns. They're going to take away everything. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, ""In God we trust."" From Nashua to Dixville, from Portsmouth to Plymouth, from Concord to Claremont, and from Meredith to right here in Manchester, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. New Hampshire was founded by tough frontier men and strong, powerful pioneer women who defied the dangers and raised their children to embrace the eternal motto, ""Live free or die."" I love that motto. Live free or die. These courageous Americans tamed the wilderness, braved the elements, changed the hills, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth and we are making it greater. Every single day, greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. That's what this is all about. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of New Hampshire, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, New Hampshire. Thank you."
Trump," Wow, thank you. Thank you, New Mexico. Thank you. We love being with you. We love being with you. Incredible people, incredible people. Thank you very much. And I'm thrilled to be here in Albuquerque with thousands of hard-working, freedom-loving American patriots. Thank you. Incredible. We're all united by the same love of our great country. And by the way, our country is doing great. You see it. The same devotion to family and the same profound faith that America is blessed by, the eternal grace of Almighty God. Good night to that person. Tomorrow they'll say, ""Massive protest."" No, one person just going home to mommy a little bit sooner. Good night. But we're bound by these convictions. We will campaign for every vote, and we will win the great state of New Mexico in 2020. And by the way, you have thousands and thousands of people outside who can't get in. So we love you, we love you, we appreciate it. We try to get the biggest arena we can get, and they're never big enough, frankly. So there's something going on. And I always say, 2016, I don't know if there'll ever be another 2016. But right now it's like a great tree or a great plant, you plant it and it has to take hold. We have to win 2020. We're doing so well. We have to win 2020. And every day, and you know as well as I do, we're battling against the corrupt establishment of the past, and we're achieving historic victories for the American people. We're winning again. We're winning again, and we're winning big. We're winning big. Crucially for your state, we have ended the last administration's war on American energy. And since my election, natural gas productions, big story today, in New Mexico has increased by 40%, 4-0. And that means great wages, and it means jobs. And that's why you're breaking every single record in your state's book. Crude oil production in New Mexico has more than doubled, and going up a lot higher very quickly. And your state's energy revenues are up by nearly two-thirds. Think of that. Two-thirds. And that's in a short period of time. Give me a little bit more time, okay? The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And this means more jobs, higher wages, and American energy independence, which is what we have. A few years ago, if we had a problem like you saw two days ago in the Middle East, we would've been in a panic. Although, not if I were your president. We never panic. We don't want to panic. But a few years ago, they would have been in a panic. Today we got a lot of oil, we got a lot of gas. We got a lot of oil and gas. We don't have to send too many boats over there. Did you notice the other day, they were saying, ""We don't see too many American ships anymore."" You know why? Because we don't need … We're independent, as independent as we want. And we are now a net exporter of energy. Revenues from energy production provide up to 25% of your state's budget and going much higher in the very near future. And they've generated nearly a billion-dollar budget surplus in New Mexico. Thank you very much, president Trump. Thank you. Now, under the Green New Deal, that all goes away. That all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric. Single car. You're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles. They'll call us ""the hermit nation."" We'll never leave our house. No, it's crazy. But that's okay. I don't want to bring it up because I don't want to do it too early. Maybe they'll change, and I don't want them to change. But think of it for you, and for Texas, and for so many other places, they want to get rid of your energy. I mean, explain that one. Explain that. Yet, every major Democrat running for president, they want to abolish all production of oil and natural gas. In other words, the Democrats want to completely annihilate New Mexico's economy. The Democrats want us to be subservient to foreign producers. They want us to be at the mercy of rogue regimes. That's not happening anymore. It's been a long time. It's been a long time. It's not happening anymore. But Democrats will never get the chance because New Mexico will never give them that chance. Under this administration, America is working again. America is winning again. And America is respected again, like it hasn't been for a long time. And I can tell you because I meet so many of the leaders, and their presidents, and their kings, and their queens, and their prime ministers, and their everything, dictators every once in a while. Every once in a while, you get an a rogue dictator. And I'll tell you, they always start off, today I had the Crown Prince of Bahrain, and they come in and they say, ""Sir, I'd like to congratulate you on what you've done with the economy of the United States. It's a model for the entire world."" They all say it. And earlier today … Do we have any baseball fans? Right? Right? You know what I'm going to say. But earlier today in the White House, I had the honor of awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom, that's the highest civilian award, to someone who truly embodies the American dream, baseball legend, the greatest, by the way, the greatest relief pitcher of all time, you look at those records, Mariano Rivera. He was something. The Yankees won a lot of World Series because of Mariano. Great guy. We gave him the medal. Done so much for charity. A fantastic man, fantastic family. It was a beautiful day at the White House, so it was good. My administration is fighting to empower all Americans to reach their dreams and achieve their potential. We have created six million new jobs since election day. The fake news would never have allowed us to say that during the campaign, even as a projection. Unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in over 50 years. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Nearly 600,000 Americans came into the labor force last month alone. Think of that. Wages in your state, New Mexico, are growing at a rate of much more than 3% a year, which is unheard of 20 years ago. And I used to say during the campaign, you go back, it's hard to believe, I'm here almost three years … Can you believe how time is flying? Can you believe it? I don't know about it me, but you look all much better than you did three years ago. You're wealthier. And even with the Me Too movement, we can't say this, but I'll say it anyway, you're better looking, including the men, including the men. Now you're all looking good. Since my election, the number of new business applications for New Mexico has increased by almost 30%, more than any state in the United States. Think of that. More than any state in the United States. So essentially, that's saying you're in a certain category, which is a very important category, you're doing better than any state in the United States. How do I lose New Mexico? Explain that one, right? How do we lose that one? And yet, for whatever reason, it's been quite a while since a Republican won this state. But we're going to win this state. And I think we're going to win this state easy. You had to see the people all the way in from the airport. That was a long drive by the way, 35 minutes. That was a long drive. But all the way in, we had people, and they were waving. And I didn't see any negative hand gesture, right? No, I think we're going to do great here. And we're here for a number of reasons, but we're here because we really think we're going to turn this state and make it a Republican state. Yesterday marked the beginning of the Hispanic Heritage Month. Who is Hispanic here? Latinos for Trump. Thank you. Incredible people. But we have much to celebrate. Unbelievable when you think, the unemployment for Hispanic-Americans is right now at the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic-American poverty reached a brand new all-time low in history. And after years of stagnation that you know very well, wages for Hispanic-Americans are rising really fast, up nearly 8% since my election. Those are unheard of numbers. They're unheard of. And median income, think of that, median income for Hispanic-Americans surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever. That's your median. That's not bad. That means you're wealthy and you're getting wealthier fast. And I just want to tell you it's an honor. But when I'm on the debate stage debating one of these far left radical Democrats, whoever it may be, and they start telling you what they're going to do for you, and you say, ""But we have the best numbers, every category, that we've ever had."" Hispanic-Americans … excuse me, New Mexico as a whole, we have the best numbers. African-Americans, the best numbers that we've ever had in the history of our country. Asian-Americans, the best numbers that we've ever had in history. Women, the best numbers that we've had in 71 years. We're working night and day to deliver a future of limitless opportunity for our nation's Hispanic-American citizens, including millions and millions of extraordinary Mexican-Americans who enrich our society, strengthen our country, serve in our military, and contribute immensely to our shared American family. And I want to just tell you that Mexico is doing a great job for us on the border, and I want to thank the president of Mexico. You know, it's very interesting, I hear everybody screaming, well, you know we're building the wall, and it's going up, and it's going up fast. And if you think that's easy with the Democrats who control the House, we have to take it back, but if you think it's easy … But we're building a lot of wall. We'll have almost 500 miles of wall built by the end the next year, and it's making a big difference. 500 miles. But you know we won a big case two months ago in the Supreme Court that allowed us to do what we're doing. This has been … I'll tell you what. Ready? Another president would have given up a long time ago. We don't give up. So we're building the wall, the Army Corps of Engineers, we're doing a beautiful job. It's a great, it's a great structure. It's a great structure. You're going to have to really want to get over that wall, to do it. But it was very interesting because, not too long ago, I saw where the Hispanic-American, the Hispanics, were up with me in a poll, 17%. And everyone said, ""How is that? How is that? How is that? 17%. Up by 17%. I won't even tell you what the final number was because they won't believe it, but you're going to see what the final number … But you know why? Because the Hispanic-Americans, they understand, they don't want criminals coming across the border. They don't want people taking their jobs. They want to have that security, and they want the wall. They want the wall. And we have a man in the audience who is, I think, the best dressed man in this entire place, including me, right here. Look at him. Come here. Look at him. Look at this guy. And he's been to a couple of rallies too, haven't you? Huh? We have some people, a group of people the other day, you know, we had a victory in North Carolina that was unbelievable. Two of them. One of them, it was going to be very, very close. Here's another one of my friends. Thank you. I like that beautiful red tie you're wearing. But we had a victory, two victories, North Carolina, where one was 17 points down three weeks ago, we got involved, we started sending out lots of different social media messages, we did a couple of little robo calls, but the big thing, we did a speech the night before. The turnout was beyond belief. And instead of being down by 17 points, he easily won the election 4,000 or 5,000 votes. Dan, thank you, Dan. Thank you, Dan Bishop. And Greg Murphy was up a couple of points, and he ended up winning, I don't know, I'd ask the media, but they won't give me how many … What did he get? Do you know? Like 20, 21? He won by a lot. He won by a lot. I'd asked them, but we're not going to get a straight answer. They were not happy. They were not happy. I'll tell you, Tuesday night, the fake news was not happy. They had their studios all built. CNN had their A- list talent. They don't have A-list talent, but they had the best they could have. And they were all set. This was going to be the end of Trump, because this man was going to lose. But he turned out to be tough and smart. And in all fairness, I helped a lot too. And toward the end of the night, they started dismantling that studio. Probably it would have been there for four weeks. This is the end. But we had two great victories, congressional victories, on Tuesday night. And it was something. The one gentleman won by a number that nobody thought even possible, so much. And the other won a race that he was way, way, way back. In fact, I shouldn't tell you this, but my geniuses, my people, some of those people standing right there, right there, some of them right there, they said, ""Sir, don't get involved in that race, sir. You can't come back from 17 points, sir. It's too much."" I said, ""But you know, I really like the guy. I think he's great. Let's give it a shot."" They say, ""Sir, if you lose, they will never, ever … It'll be much worse."" I said, ""Let me tell you, I know them very well. Whether I help him or don't help him, it's going to be the same. It's going to be a disaster. So let's help him."" And we campaigned, and we worked hard, right? They said, ""Don't do it, sir. Don't do it. Please don't do it, sir. It'll be very embarrassing."" I said, ""No, I don't mind being embarrassed. I don't mind being embarrassed."" We're also very proud that unemployment among Native Americans has reached the lowest rate in nearly two decades. And we're building an amazing future for citizens of every background, race, religion, color, and creed. And that's what we have. That's what we have. Race, religion, color, and creed. But the radical left Democrats want to demolish everything that we've gained. They want to raise your taxes. They want to bury you in regulation. They want to take away your health insurance, 180 million Americans. They want to erase American history, crush religious liberty, indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology. And left-wing Democrats want to confiscate your guns and eliminate your God-given right to self-defense. You know that. As your president, I will never allow them to take away your liberty, your dignity, and your social security. And I will never, ever allow them to take away your sacred right to keep and bear arms. The left tries to threaten, bully, intimidate Americans into submission. They use Democrat prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever they can. They'll do whatever they can to demean you, to libel you. They try to blacklist, coerce, cancel, or destroy anyone who gets in their way. Look at what they're doing today to Justice Kavanaugh. Look at what they're doing. Did you see the New York Times? Did you see what they're doing? Did you see what Democrats, they're calling for his resignation. They're calling for his impeachment. And the woman involved said she didn't know anything. But they still, so the New York Times had to put out a major apology, and they had to change their story. The woman said, ""I don't remember that."" Can you believe? And they still want him to be impeached. And I just put out a statement. And he's a great man, by the way, a great talent. A great brilliant man, Brett Kavanaugh. and I just put out a statement on social media that said, I don't think they'll do it, but they should, for the good of the nation, ""I call for the resignation of everybody at the New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh smear story."" And while you're at it, the Russian witch-hunt hoax, which is just as phony a story. They've taken, the old gray lady, do you know the New York Times, for years, the old gray lady, so prestigious, they've taken the old great lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue, and ruined her reputation. She can never recover, and will never return to greatness under current management. The Times is dead. Long live The New York Times. Long lived The New York Times. And I do want it to live, but they have to be, they have to change their ways. Think of it, they wrote a story about somebody that said she doesn't remember this. Can you even believe it? And yet, all of these radical left crazies are in judiciary committee and all of these committees that are set up to hurt the country. With all that we have going, with Saudi Arabia, with Iran, with China trade deal, with Russia, with North Korea, with all that we have going, look at the cards that we've been dealt, lucky we won the election in 2016, believe me. With all that we have going, they say, ""Let's impeach Justice Kavanaugh,"" one of the smartest, most brilliant students, top at Yale, incredible life, incredible family. ""Let's impeach him."" It's a made-up story. ""Let's impeach President Trump."" Think of that. The Muller Report came out. Think of this. This crazy Mueller Report comes out, 18 Trump haters, liberal Democrats, some worked for Hillary Clinton, they found nothing. No, think of it. After two years, they found nothing. They spent $40 million. There's not a person in the room that I couldn't find something on with that. They spent, think of it, they found nothing. No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing. To stop the far left's campaign of destruction, you must vote Republican. And you're going to get the chance very soon. We're joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders, and somebody that's done an incredible job, she ran Michigan for me. And as you know, for the presidential races, Michigan hadn't been won in decades, and she kept saying, ""Could you come back, sir?"" I didn't know who she was. I said, ""Who the heck is the woman in Michigan that keeps asking?"" She said, ""Sir, if you keep coming back, you're going to win Michigan."" Hasn't been won in decades. And I won Michigan. Remember that great, great night? November. That great, great night. ""Donald Trump has won the great state of Michigan."" And they were going crazy on television. They were going, that was not a good night- Going crazy on television. They were going, that was not a good night for certain people. Remember the couple of people that were crying? I guess they don't like a strong military. They don't like cutting regulations. They don't like low taxes. They don't like Right to Try, you know Right to Try. All these things we've done. For the Vets, we got choice. We got choice for the Vets. Choice. Everybody said it was impossible. We've rebuilt our military. I told this story for the first time today. A general came into my office in my first few weeks, you remember? It was a little dangerous out there. President Obama left us with a few beauties, right? And I said to this general, ""You better be prepared, because this is looking like it could really be conflict."" And he looked at me and he goes, ""Sir, we have very little ammunition."" I said, ""Say it again."" And I want to tell you the words, very little, he didn't use because it was less than that. And I said, ""I never want to see a president in a position like that, where we may have conflict, and a general looks at him and said, ‘We have very little/ no ammunition.'"" I never want a president of the United States to be in that position. And since then, three years, $700 billion we've spent, then $716 billion. And now, $738 billion. And our military is by far the greatest in the world. There's nobody that even comes close. So anyway, no president should ever be put in that position. And by the way, no president should ever have to go through what I've gone through either. That should never happen. What happened is a disgrace to our country. No president should ever have to go through it. And I'll tell you what, 99% of them would never have been able to take it. They wouldn't have been able to take it. But we won the great state of Michigan, and now we're doing really well, because we've moved a lot of car companies. I tell Japan, sorry, big deficits with all these countries, we're changing it, but you've got to get car companies. We're building car companies now in Michigan. They're not going to be leaving for lots of other countries, including China, including Mexico. They're going to stay home, and they're going to pay you a lot of money, and everybody's going to be happy. But Michigan's doing great. And Ronna McDaniel was the Republican Party chair of Michigan. So when we won the election, I said, ""Let's get the woman from Michigan to run the RNC."" And she has done an incredible job. Thank you Ronna. A great gentleman who loves the Republican Party, co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. Tommy, what a job. New Mexico Republican party chairman. Steve Pearce. My friend and a really talented guy, he just gets the hell knocked out of him all the time. Brad Parscale. What a job he's doing, Brad. Great job, Brad. Great job. And another great friend of mine, somebody that was on CNN, and they didn't like him because he was too positive on Trump. Can you believe it? He happens to be Hispanic. He happens to be Hispanic, but I've never quite figured it out, because he looks more like a wasp than I do. So I haven't figured that one out. But I'll tell you what. There is nobody that loves his country more or Hispanic more than Steve Cortez, Steve. Thank you Steve. Nobody loves the Hispanics more. Who do you like more, the country or the Hispanics? He says the country. I don't know. I may have to go for the Hispanics to be honest. We got a lot of Hispanics. We love our Hispanics. Get out and vote. You know, just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote, close to 90%. they gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award. And the Venezuelans and the Cubans are all for Trump, I will tell you that. They're all for Trump. They like what we're doing. With the help of, and Steve, I want to thank you very much by the way, and you were incredible on CNN, and now you'll get a real job. Okay? Steve, that audience wasn't big enough for you. Their ratings aren't good. With the help of everyone here tonight, we're taking power out of Washington and giving it back to the great people of our country, and to the people of New Mexico. We've cut a record number of job-killing regulations, saving the average American household $3,000. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. What that means is a typical family of four in New Mexico making $75,000 has seen their tax bill reduced by more than $2,000. And it's one of the reasons that as the world is not doing great, you look at Europe, and you look at Asia, and China's not doing too well. I must be honest with you, worst year in 57 years, I'd say that's not good. But I hope they still like me. And we've taken in tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs, and we've given those tariffs, and by the way, China's eating the tariffs, they're devaluing their currency, the prices are very similar. They're eating the tariffs. And out of the tens of billions we gave our great farmers, because they were targeted by China, because China knows, very smart, that the farmers love Trump, and Trump loves the farmers. I said to our Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, I said, ""Sonny, how much did the farmers get hit by China targeting them and pulling back and doing all sorts of things?"" He said, ""$16 billion."" I said, ""That's okay. We'll take $16 billion out of a much, much, much larger number. We're going to give it to the farmers, so that they're even."" And I tell you, the farmers do love Trump, they do love Trump. And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches, and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax, so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children. Now, if you don't like your children, don't do it. But when it's your time to kick the bucket, you worked hard. You have great kids, you love your kids, they're taking care of you. You really love them. It's a great thing. If you don't love them, don't even listen to the last line, because it won't matter. Don't leave it to them. If they're not good, leave it to charity. Leave it to something else. Don't get it to them. I know a guy who can't stand his children, they're horrible, horrible human beings. They're a little older now, but they're horrible human beings. He wants to leave his wealth. I said, ""Why would you leave them? They don't even like you."" But on the assumption that you love your children, you'll be able to use small farms and your ranches and things. You'll be able to leave them to your children. Your children won't have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay tax. They won't be losing it to the banks five years later. We got rid of it. That's a big deal. Thank you. Thank you. Our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and 100% pro-American. For many decades, our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests. You know that, in New Mexico, you know exactly what I'm talking about. People came in, they took your jobs, they had no border, they had no border control. Look at what's going on now, how we're doing. I mean, honestly, I mentioned the president of Mexico. We have today 27,000 Mexican soldiers on the border protecting our country. And I'll take it. Because our laws are so bad, they're so pathetic. And the Democrats could change these laws. They could change them so quickly. We could change them all in less than an hour. We could, whether it's asylum, whether it's any of the laws, we have so many of them that are so bad. How they got that, it took years and years to end up. But we have the Mexican soldiers out there. You see them, and they're stopping people. The numbers are plummeting down. So I just want to thank all of the representatives of Mexico. Amazing. Well, we've got to get rid of the loopholes. You know, the word is loopholes, and the Democrats could do it fast. But in the meantime, we're doing really well. And as the wall goes up, it becomes less and less of a problem, because as the wall gets up, people aren't getting through. I mean you got to be a a world class pole vaulter, or a world class Mount Everest type climber. There's not too many around like that. It's really doing the trick. The failed liberal establishment in Washington squandered your tax dollars, shipped away your jobs, sacrificed your sovereignty, and bogged us down in one foreign war, or debacle, call it whatever you want after another. And that's changing also, you see what's happening, and when these rich countries think we're going to pay for their military every year, billions and billions and billions, and they're rich, and they take our business and we're supposed to, on top of everything else, I could tell you stories, but I'm going to save them for the campaign. Because to be honest, this is a little earlier than the campaign. Wait until this campaign starts, you know, like I was telling Brad and I was telling a few of the folks, one thing I don't want to do, Michael back there, Michael, hello. What a job he's done. But I'm telling them I don't want to do this too early. I don't want to do it. You know the Pocahontas thing, I did that, it was before its time. Right? It was before it's time. Too early. 1,024. That means I have more Indian blood than she does, and I have none, unfortunately. I'd like to say I have a lot. Got to get me another 4%. maybe another 10%. but I was early with her, and frankly, oh it's coming back, don't worry about her. But those days are over under this administration. We are finally putting America first. Putting it first. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that ravished our industries and devastated communities all across our land. You see the factories, empty buildings, empty hulks. Some have been demolished, some have been reconverted into senior citizen housing and housing. But all those jobs are gone, and we're bringing them back. They're coming back like almost never before. Probably, I can say they're coming back like never before. People are coming back now, because they want to be where the action is. And this is the country where they have the security, and where they do have the action. In my first week in office, I proudly withdrew from the last administration's job-destroying… and this was a catastrophe. You know, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, this would have destroyed the automobile business in our country. Now New Mexico, you know that you were totally devastated by another disaster known as NAFTA. Your state lost 33% of its manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed. This was one of the great catastrophes. And now we're replacing NAFTA with the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA. Think of the song YMCA. YMCA. Think of the song. USMCA, that's US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. And it's drawing strong Bipartisan support from all across your state, and all across the country. It's amazing. I want to just, yeah. the Dona Ana County Board of Commissioners, all Democrats just unanimously endorsed the USMCA, and urged Congress to pass it immediately. Thank you very much commissioners. All Democrats. Hopefully they'll put it up for a vote. Nancy Pelosi, they put it up for vote. It's going to be very popular. The Republicans love it, and the Democrats love it, and frankly, labor loves it. Unions love it. Farmers love, love, love it, and everybody wants it. Your farmers, your ranchers, everybody wants it. It's an incredible agreement. And Mexico's already passed it, and Canada's ready to pass it, soon as we do. See, they don't maybe trust us, that's why. They say, ""Why aren't you passing it now?"" They say, ""Oh, we'll pass it."" They're going to pass it as soon as we do. Past leaders invited China to freely loot and pillage the United States economy. China's been taking out from 300 billion to $500 billion a year. Billion, not million. Billion. Think of what $500 billion is. We've rebuilt China, but now it's a different ball game. Somebody had to do something with China. President Obama should have done it. Presidents Bush should have done it. President Clinton should have done it. They all should have done it. Frankly, they all should have done a lot of things that we're doing right now. So if you look at it, nobody did it, so I'm doing it, and that's what's going to happen. We're doing well. So now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from China. When in the past, we never got 25 cents. We never got money. We never got anything. You know what we got? Unemployment and losses. And some cheap pencils. More than we needed. You could do with one less pencil. Following decades of outsourcing and offshoring, our jobs and factories are coming back home where they belong. If foreign companies do not want to pay our tariffs, there is one very simple solution. Come and make your product in America. Come and make your product in New Mexico. And by the way, I'm just seeing this great group of people, this spirit, is there any place in the world that's more fun or more exciting than a Trump rally? Really? Is there anything? When you think about it, it's not about fun. It's about achievement. Because what we've achieved in the last almost three years is unparalleled. There's never been an administration that in the first two and a half years has done what we've been able to do or achieve. In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges including court of appeals judges. Because President Obama did us a great favor when I came in, I said, ""I assume I have no judges to appoint."" No sir, you have 138 judges. 138? Didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved. I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138, now we're up to 180. I just signed my 150th federal judge, and court of appeals judge, and we already have two great Supreme Court justices, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh. Great, great men. So think of that. You know, you come in, and I've always heard the most important thing a president does, I disagree with this by the way, but that's okay. I disagree with a lot of things. Because I think the most important thing is our military, and protecting our country, right? But have you listened to the so-called Washington elite, now why are they elite? We do better than they do, we're smarter than them. We make more money, we have better houses, we have better everything, and then they say the elite. That means you're the super elite. I've always take offense when somebody said, ""President Trump is tired of listening to the elite."" I said, ""No, no, I'm more elite than them."" Right? I think so. I mean, if we go by the old standards, better houses, better schools, made much more money, lived better, had everything going, and then I decide to run for president. And I'll be honest, while we have to put up with these people, and others are, it's incredible. But it's the greatest single decision I've ever made, because our country is turning around so rapidly. I could not be happier, despite what they put us all through. Could not be happier. After years of building up other countries, we're finally building up our country. Isn't that nice? It's time to finally take care of our own. And we're all so aggressively combating the opioid epidemic, which is horrible. And as a result of our nonstop efforts, and billions and billions of dollars invested, last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths, and it was a very big decline in nearly three decades. 30 years. And at the center of America's drug crisis, this is where the Hispanics know it better than anybody. People said, ""Oh, the Hispanics won't like a wall."" I said, ""I think they're going to love it."" They won't like border security. I think they going to love it. You know why? Because you understand it better than other people, but at the whole center of this crisis is the drugs that are pouring in, and you understand that when other people don't understand it. The border crisis, every day dangerous criminal cartels smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across your Southern border, including heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl, and we're stopping them now. You see the kind of numbers, we're getting millions and millions and millions of dollars worth. We've had some shipments where it could kill half of the country, some of the fentanyl and some of the bad, really bad stuff. If it were distributed, it could actually, has the power to kill half of the country. This is like a warlike situation. That's why you're liking Trump, because you're not going to let that happen. If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic and they traffic really for the most part in women, that's what they traffic in, it's women. They're not trafficking in men. They capture women, and they bring them across the open borders, and they don't go through ports of entry, where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas, and they hang a left, or they hang a right and they come in, but now when you have a wall, they can't do that. Right? They can't do that. And so many of these Democrats that are against the wall, it's common sense? Look, you know what I saw the other day? Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention, they just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it's for? They're building a big wall around the building, they're building a big wall. A massive wall. We should tell them, open borders. Let anybody come in. And a few years ago, almost every one of these, they're on tape. That's the problem with politics. Three years ago, they could say, look, I saw Senator Schumer, I saw Nancy… I saw all of them. They said, ""No, we need a wall. We must have a wall."" President Obama, ""We must have a wall. We must stop people from coming into our country illegally. We have to stop it. We need a wall."" Now, a few years later, they don't want a wall. You know why? Because anything I want, they want to do the opposite. And that's okay. That's the only reason. But if you want to stop the drug smugglers, human traffickers and vicious MS-3 gang members, which we're taking out every year by the thousands, and getting them the hell out of our country, because of ICE. And if you want to stop all these people from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth, you know it's poisoning our youth. That's what it is, it's nothing other than that, it's very simple. They're poisoning our youth. You have only one choice. You must elect Republicans. And to be honest with you, you've got to elect President Trump. We need four more years. President Trump. How about these phony Democrats? They started with Russia, Russia, Russia. That turned out to be be a fraud. That turned out to be a fraud. Then they went to race. Do you believe that one? Race. I'm the least racist person in this room. Then they went to recession, there's going to be a recession. Oh please, let there be a recession, please. Because we have a better chance of defeating him if there's a recession. And unfortunately, the stock market's only a few points from its all time high, which we've broken on, I think it's well over a hundred times. We broke the all time record. And now they have a new one. And I'm enriching myself. Let me tell you, by doing this and taking this particular job, which I love, it will cost me billions and billions of dollars, but if somebody from the Middle East that I never saw before, comes in and stays in one of my hotels for an evening, and pays $439, emoluments. Nobody ever heard the word emolument before. Emolument, nobody ever heard that word, emolument. He's enriching himself. If somebody buys a tank of gas in Scotland, from an airport that I don't own, and they happen to go to a hotel, he's enriching himself, like 20 people, I'm going to lose billions of dollars, and that's okay. I expected to do that when I did it. I didn't know what would happen if I lost. Can you imagine? Supposing I lost, and we would have had the same basic rhetoric. I mean, winning was great. Supposing, you know, I'm doing all the things. I'm telling you all the same sort of things. Supposing I didn't make it. I'd have to go around. I would've lost and lost billions, then I would have been really unhappy. But I'll tell you what, I expected that when I did this, in terms of opportunity, in terms of certain places, they can never do as well when you have this kind of rhetoric, they can never do. So I'll lose billions of dollars, always expected. They say, I enrich myself because somebody is going to stay at my hotel. It doesn't work that way folks. And these are very, very dishonest people, and they know it. So they've given up on every other hoax, but it doesn't work that way. You know it too. You get it. The democrat agenda of open borders places vast burdens on your communities, and your schools, and your hospitals, and public safety all at the expense of hardworking New Mexico families, and throughout our country. Sheriffs, and commissioners from nine Mexico counties recently sent a letter to your state's congressional delegation begging them to vote for strong border security they want in New Mexico. They don't want open borders. They don't want criminals pouring into your communities, and doing what they do, and we won't even talk about that. They want strong, these are people that are with you in many cases, Democrats. They write letters, we need strong border security. In San Diego, California is very difficult. Always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego, good mayor in San Diego by the way. They wanted a wall. And I said, ""You know what, let's build it someplace else."" Because California, you know, once we build it, they'll complain. But then I said, ""You know, the people are pouring in."" They needed it. They're pouring into San Diego, like going all over the place. And people that had houses, they didn't like people running over their gardens all day long, coming in from the other side. So we put up a wall, and I thought everybody would be happy. As soon as it was finished, the day it was finished, I was notified. We didn't want the wall. Why did you do the wall? And I will tell you, in other words, it's all a game. I'd love to take the sucker down and move it right now to New Mexico. And if I did that, they'd go crazy. And they'd say, ""Please sir, don't do that. Please, please."" The same people that are saying, ""We don't want a wall. Why did you put up a wall?"" And I knew that was going to happen. I told my people that was going to happen. But they're very happy with their wall. Most of them won't say it. They love it. It stopped… it only stopped 99.9% of the people coming in. And the only reason I'm not moving it to New Mexico is that it would cost more money to move it than to build you a brand new, beautiful wall, so I'll give you a brand new beautiful wall. … New beautiful wall, I'll give you a brand-new one. It's true. It's true. I actually priced it out. It's true. These contractors, all my life I've been deal… They can find a way to make money. ""Sir, it'll cost more money to move the wall that they built a new one."" They have it, but the commission your commissioners wrote, I quote, ""Our communities do not have the resources nor the budgets to handle the massive influx of immigrants we are experiencing."" This is your commissioners writing to us in Washington. Our scarce resources are in danger of being rapidly depleted to the point that we will be unable to effectively care for our own citizens, you, and our existing homeless populations, many of whom are American veterans, right? So, Democrats put illegal aliens before American citizens. Republicans believe that we must take care of our own citizens first. I'm sorry. That includes millions of hardworking, lawful immigrants who waited in line, followed the rules, and came into our country legally. And among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are Hispanic Americans who obey our laws, pay their taxes, contribute to our communities and play by the rules, and they're the ones that want to see something done and we are doing it at a level that nobody else would be capable of doing it. Whether you're a first generation or a 10th generation, every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family, and is always loyal to you. Your politicians have not been loyal to you. They have been loyal to themselves. The Democrats are also trying to turn every city in America into a sanctuary for criminal aliens, and that's one of the very good reasons we won on Tuesday night, North Carolina, because they let people out of their sanctuary city and what those people did, I will not tell you tonight, but it wasn't good. It's one of the reasons we had big victories, two of them in North Carolina, sanctuary cities. And plenty of people, even in California where they have sanctuary cities, they don't want sanctuary cities. The politicians do, but they don't want them. Right here in New Mexico, Democrats are trying to turn you into a total sanctuary state, creating a safe harbor for dangerous criminal aliens and gang members that sanctuary policies release from jail. Now, think of it. They want to make your whole state a sanctuary state. So, when MS-13 comes in, and I told you before, we take them out by the thousands and they're tough. They're tough, but our ICE folks are even tougher. There's nobody tougher. I would say naive, but maybe it's much worse than that. They're naive, these politicians. The naive politicians, they don't want ICE to come in. They don't want to take these criminals out. And if you don't take them out and they're in New Mexico, I got to tell you something, folks. You got problems. You got problems. You've got big problems. Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. And Republicans will always support the heroes of ICE, border patrol and our great law enforcement. The Democrat party… Do you notice I always say the Democrat party? You know, before I came, they were all calling it Democratic because it sounds better, right? It does. It's much nicer. The Democratic party is much nicer than the Democrat party, but their name is the Democrat party, and I'm not looking for them to sound nice. I want to give their name. So, I always say the Democrat party, but that's their name, the Democrat party. Frankly, they should probably change it because it does… And then I'd call them the Democratic party, but the Democrat party has never been farther outside the mainstream. Every major… That's a nasty fly. I don't like those suckers. I don't know about you in New Mexico, but I'm not into flies or mosquitoes. I don't like snakes too much. We have plenty of them in New York and Washington, a different variety. I don't like snakes either. We got a lot of snakes in Washington DC. We got a lot of steaks in New York. I don't like either kind of snake. I think I like the kind on the ground better than the ones we have in Washington. Every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would destroyed Medicare as we know it today. My administration will protect Medicare and defend your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. The Republicans will always do that. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 50 years. You don't hear this because the fake news doesn't want to write about it. Sometimes I'll have a news conference about something that's so good and I'll say, you know… I'll call my wife, first lady, first lady. People love our first lady. I'll say, ""Wait until you see television tonight, and we did something that was so great,"" whatever it may be. We did a lot of things. We did something so great and it won't be on, but if there's something that's just slightly negative or even if it's good that they could turn negative, that's what they like best. Take something good and turn it negative. It's breaking… We have breaking news. We have breaking news. These are phony people, but that's okay. You know, when you think of it, I'm president and they're not. Crazy. It's crazy. You know, sometimes I'll be in the oval office and I'll be with my people. We have great people, and I'll say, ""You know,"" and it's great comm in the oval office. You don't like to hear about it because you don't hear about it too much. That's not what they… But we have great comm considering it's pretty wild stuff going on in the world, right? But I'll be saying, ""You know, they don't treat us right. They don't treat us right. It's not fair. It's not this."" And then I'll just sit back, I'll say, ""But we're in the oval office and they're not. It's pretty amazing. It's pretty amazing."" And when you have the Democrat party and the press, the media, the lame stream media, the fake news, and they're partners… They are partners, okay? Remember the word ""Manufactured?"" They used the word manufacturer on something, never been used for that thing, and every news gets ""The manufactured crisis started."" The next one, ""This crisis was manufactured."" Every one of them used the word ""Manufactured."" They know what I'm talking about now. Now, that's called collusion, folks. That's real collusion. You have that, and so you have the Democrats, you have the media, their partners. Then you have the deep state. We're getting rid of a lot of them. I'll tell you, we're finding them left and right. Boom. You take a look at what… I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. You take a look at what we're doing with all of the things. I'm not going to get into detail, but you know what I'm talking about. Clean the swamp. That's the ultimate cleaning of the swamp. And then I hate to say this, but we have some Republicans, they're not good. You call them a rhino. They're rhinos. The rhinos are worse, and some of them are worse than the Obama people, right? They're worse than the Obama people. They're worse than the Clinton people, but there aren't too many of them left. They're pretty much on respirators. They're gasping. They're gasping for air, but we do have some bad people that you wouldn't believe. I didn't hear you. Why did you say why? What? I didn't hear that. Virtually, every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers right up until the moment of birth, and that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. It's true. Right? I see it. Just like mom, I see it. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, and socialism. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it is the party of the American dream. We've achieved record funding for the US military. All of that money, trillions and trillions of dollars spent all produced right here in the good old USA. And I have to tell you, New Mexico, I know you're going to like this. A lot of those trillions because you know when you do the 716 and the 730 and the 700 -billion, all of a sudden you're in trillions and I can save a lot of lines when I just say trillions. A lot of that money's going to be spent in the state of the art military equipment that's being used at Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range, Kirkland Air Force Base and many other vital New Mexico military installations that are going up as we speak. That's also jobs, but more importantly than even jobs, incredible. What you've done for the military, New Mexico, is incredible and we've remembered, but we're pouring a lot of money into New Mexico and that means a lot of good things. And we're investing in our nation's nuclear security, including right here in New Mexico and Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory. To protect American security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It was no good and we oppose the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian regime. Watch how that works out, folks. That'll be very good. I recognized Israel's true capitol and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And don't forget what I did for Israel with respect to Golan Heights. Don't forget, right? For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for New Mexico. And you must never forget. Get out there and vote and get ready and get everybody. We need it because we're fighting a lot of forces, including Facebook, I saw, and Google, I saw. Did you see Google? He said I may have lost two-million to 10-million votes, according to this character that worked at Google, right? And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a Google executive. From two-million to 10.5-million votes, and we won. I don't know, we must be doing… I will say this. That happened and people came from the valleys. They came from everywhere. They Came from places that nobody's ever talked about before and it was the forgotten men and women, but the truth is I know these men and women and they're the most incredible men and women in this country. They really are. They just never had anybody they really wanted to vote for or at least for a long time, they didn't want to get out there. They said, ""Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Is this the best they can do?"" I mean, in all fairness, I don't want to go too early here. Look at the field. Did you watch the debate the other day? We've got almost 350-million people. I'll take it. That's the best they can do. We'll see. We'll see. You never want to get too cocky. Somebody said in the great state of Texas, ""Donald Trump is down two points to Buttigieg."" Buttigieg. Buttigieg. They're phony polls. You know they have phony polls. I told this story the other night. For six months, I was hearing that I'm going to lose the state of Texas and friends of mine from Texas that look just like these guys. See these two guys with the hates? They might even be better looking. They look just like… And they want to say, ""I don't know about you, but I know a lot about Texas and Donald Trump is not going to be losing the state of Texas."" Remember that? See, they don't say it's in play. They're too smart. They say Texas is in play. And Utah, they said was it play. All these are in play and play means we could lose them, right? It's a better term though because this way, they can't get skunked, but they can get skunked with me. So, what happens is on that beautiful election… Was that one of the greatest, coolest nights ever? Well, they can never call a victory unless you absolutely have it and unless you're winning by a lot. This is six months. ""Texas is in play. You know, he could lose Texas."" I keep saying, I go to a stadium, we sell out to thousands of people, lines that are miles long. I mean, and every friend of mine says, ""You're going to win by a lot."" 00, whatever time, ""The polls in Texas are closed. Donald Trump has won this state of Texas. The polls in Utah are closed. Donald Trump has won the state of Utah."" They don't even take a breath. Now, if it's close like it's in play, you wait two, three, four or five hours to see what it is, but they don't even a breath because they're called suppression poles and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people see. They're no different. They're suppression polls, and I'll tell you what. We're going to win the state of New Mexico and I'll be so surprised if we don't. I'll be so surprised. No, we're going to win New Mexico. You know, when I came here during the last election, came here a little because I was told very hard to win and I came here a little, but I saw great spirit. But I didn't really have a track record because I never did this stuff before. So, I said I was going to cut your taxes. I did. I said I was going to cut your regulations. I did more than any president in history and they've been there for many years. I've been there for two and a half. And I think the regulation cutting… Like the Waters of the US, that was another beauty where you couldn't build a house, you couldn't farm your land. Now, what we've done on regulations is incredible. I've done… I've rebuilt our military, I've taken care of our vets. Look how happy our vets are with choice. Instead of waiting for two months to see a doctor or two weeks or three days, they now go out. If there's a wait, they go out, they get a private doctor. They get taken care of. We pay the bill. And for the first time, they've tried to get that for 45 years, they haven't been able to get it, but I'm good at getting things. You must never forget. The 2020 election is about one thing. What's it about? It's about you. It is. It's about you. It's about you. I'm doing a good job as your messenger, but basically I'm a messenger. I know what you want. I understand that it's about your family. It's about your future, and it's about the fate of your country for your children, for everybody. It's about the fate of your country. It's about the future of our great country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream. That's what it's about. Look at Venezuela. Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world and today, very sad. No food, no water, no nothing. Socialism. We begin this campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America. And it's not just a little bit positive. Our country is going to be greater than it ever was. That's where we're headed. Together, we will help millions more citizens know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job really well done. With your help, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and very lawful system of immigration. And we're going to have a lot done anyway. We already do have a lot done. You saw the figures last week, but we're doing it the hard way. It would be so much easier with a little stroke of the pen. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, that incredible phrase, ""Made in the USA."" We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years, and we've already started that program. It will happen. We have the medicine. Nobody even knew that. The AIDS epidemic in this country will be gone within 10 years. We've already started the process. It's been funded. It's been funded. Who would've thought that? Honestly, when I ran, I didn't know that. We have now the technology and what they've done with respect to AIDS is incredible. What a terrible, terrible period of time the world went through, but we will have it ended within 10 years. We will defeat the effort to drive up the cost of houses, cars, healthcare, light bulbs. Right? They took away our light bulb. I want an incandescent light. I want to look better, okay? I want to pay less money to look better. Does that make sense? You pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that, with the new bulbs, if they break, it's considered a hazardous waste site. It's all gases inside and you're supposed to bring it back to where you bought it in a sealed container. Give me a break. I asked the people, the professionals, ""Well, what do people do when it breaks? Because they break all the time. What do they do?"" Nothing, they throw it away. A lot of people didn't know. They didn't understand. You got a much better light at a much reduced cost and it's much safer because when those other bulbs break, they really are dangerous. The gases come out, they're dangerous. These are the little things that I have to explain. Otherwise, people will say, ""What the hell are you doing with light bulbs for?"" And we're trying to do the same thing with cars. Cars have so much junk on them now to save a tiny little fraction of gasoline. They have so much junk that they're less safe. So, what I want to do is the following. Under our rules and regulations, the cars are environmentally terrific, but they're safer and they're $3,500 less to buy, right? And the reason they're safer is because they could be a little bit heavier. Makes sense, right? They could be a little bit heavier. I mean, they make them now like paper mache. Somebody touches them and the entire car collapses. When somebody hits me, I want to be in as close to an army tank as possible. No, they're made out of paper mache. They weigh about three pounds and if you get hit by a bus, it's over. They say, ""What happened to that car?"" No, I think of it, it's safer and it's less expensive by $3,500 on average. And California wants you to do the other cars and we don't. We're going to end up in a big litigation and I'm fighting for you. Look. Look, it's not the kind of thing most presidents would be fighting for because they say, ""Let them pay more. Let it be unsafe."" They listen to the environmentalists, and I'm an environmentalist. I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know, right now, we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country? But what are they going to do about China and India and Russia and other countries that are spewing stuff? What are we doing about them? We're going to keep our nation clean. But you know, the universe is so big that when you talk about China, the USA, India, you talk about these different places where a lot of bad stuff comes out, right? It's so big that it's right next to each other. It's right next to each other. Does that make sense? Right? It's right next to each other. So, what are they going to do? We want to have the cleanest water and the cleanest air. We will defend privacy. We will defend free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and we will always defend your second amendment and we're doing it now. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that mothers and fathers, not Washington bureaucrats, know best how to raise their strong, beautiful families in their loving and wonderful communities. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will always live by the words of our national motto. Nobody will ever take it down. Nobody will ever take it down. We will never allow them to take it down. In God we trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are going to be better than ever before and it won't even be close, and we're right there. Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered sciences, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world. And every day of my presidency, we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to each and every one of you. Right? With your help, your devotion and your drive…  Gee, it's too bad. He did it right in the crescendo. How do you top that? I just readied the big beautiful crescendo and this character's going back home. It's all right. It's two people tonight. Remember, when they say ""Massive protest at the Trump rally,"" two people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning in a win like never before. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of the great state of New Mexico, we love you. The best is yet to come. Best is yet to come. Thank you, New Mexico. And together, we will make America wealthy again. Very, very wealthy. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. New Mexico. Thank you. Thank you, New Mexico. Thank you. Thank you."
Trump,"Wow, that's a big crowd. This is a big crowd. Thank you very much, everybody. Hello to Swanton and a load to Toledo. I'm thrilled to be back in Ohio with thousands of hardworking, loyal, great American patriots … days from now. Can you believe it, 43 days? We go to again win Ohio. I understand from Bob Paduchik, you know Bob? That we're going to win it by more than we did. Whether we win at nine, we won by nine points. I just came into that big, beautiful place. It's got more televisions in any plane in history. They've got televisions and closets and bathrooms on the floor, on the ceilings. I just saw that we're tied in Ohio. I don't think so … President Trump may have a slim lead in Ohio? They're not even campaigning in Ohio, come to think of it. Now, they're fake polls. They're almost as fake as the writers themselves. They're all fake. Remember last time they said, ""No, he's going to lose Ohio."" We won by nine points. So, we had seven swing states last time. President Trump is going to go home early, but it wasn't president at that time, it was just Donald Trump. He will go home early. We did. That we went home early as victors, but we had nine states. They had one of the crazy papers, New York Times. They hired that guy. They paid him millions because he never predicted wrong. He was wrong. I don't know if they had a contract where they could fire him, but they hired this guy. We had nine states. I was down at all of them on the day of election. I was going to lose all nine, and then guess what? I won every one of them. Fake polls. They're fake polls. Then we have a crowd like this. I don't know. Look, the cameras, are you turning around? These guys are bad people. I swear. They never turn the cameras around, ever. Turn them around. Turn them around. They never tell, look at them. It's just like a bunch of stiffs. Real stiffs. Why don't you turn the cameras around for once? You look back there, you can't see it. There's got to be, feels like Madison Square Garden on the ground except we have more people. Oh boy, it's always tough. You know, we go through this all the time. We're always asking them, look at these crowds. I mean, as far, you can't see it. You have this prime territory, like you should be in the real estate business. Now, as far as the eye can see back there, the cameras don't, they don't get it. You only hear it from the sound. I go home. I say to the first lady, ""Did you see that crowd we had tonight in Ohio?"" She goes, ""No, no. They just keep it on your face."" That includes Fox. They just keep it here, right here. They don't want to show. You know what they don't know and what they don't get is that showing this kind of activity is a good thing for them. It's positive for their ratings. It's really a good thing, but they don't want to do it, but I give up on it. You know what you do? You hear it because you can't have … You know when sleepy Joe Biden, he's got the circles. You knowthose big circles? You know why he has the circles? He's got four of them, because they can't … I mean, think of it. He is a guy who's failed every time he ran. We called him 1% Joe and now he's shot and he got their nomination. How the hell does that work out? How does that work out? But he's got the circles. He got like four, sometimes he has six because that's a good way of saying, if you don't have any people, just put them in the circle and he's practicing the science. Now it doesn't work out, but we're going to win four more years in the White House. We're doing things that nobody's ever done before. We're doing what nobody's ever done, and thank you for being here. I wish we could move the press back further, if you want to know the truth. As our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice … Thank you everybody. Thank you. So is our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I will soon announce a nominee for the United States Supreme Court. They say it's the most important thing a president can do. I don't know. I think military, maybe. We rebuilt your military two and a half trillion dollars. Great. We will fill that seat. It's going to go quickly. Probably announced the person. I don't want to make the men too angry. It will be a woman. Is that okay? I don't want to have a problem with men. They'll say Trump is doing very poorly with men. You listen. How's he doing? Well, he's doing very poorly with men, with women. He's doing very poorly with the black community, Hispanic community. Then you have the election night doing very poorly with those with diploma, without diploma, college, PhDs. What's he doing well? Oh no, it's going to be a very short night. Then they say Donald Trump is the projected winner by a lot. They say, well, what happened is he did very well with women did very well with men, diplomas. He did well with African American community. By the way, we are doing really well with the African American community, with the Hispanic community. We're doing well with women. We're doing very well. We're doing well with suburbia, suburbia. I ended a regulation that will destroy suburbia. If Biden got in, they will destroy the suburbia. We call it suburbia of the world and we love it. I know it well, Westchester County, the suburban, they sometimes, if you say suburban housewife, you're in deep trouble. So what you do is you say suburban women, they love me. You know why? They want security and they don't want projects being right next to their house. That's okay. They don't want it. By the way, that includes minorities. Because 29% to 30% of these suburban communities are minorities. That includes them. They don't want that. They want safe communities. They want great communities. They don't want to lose the American dream. It's very simple. I got rid of the regulation from Obama- Biden that was destroying suburbia. Okay? Destroying it. I think suburbia has got to wake up because if they get in, you know who's in charge? You know who's in charge of the program? Cory Booker, Cory Booker. Cory Booker. So, I think the suburban women and suburban men and husbands and wives and everybody, you better get smart because you're not going to have your dream very much longer if they get in. If I get in, you've got it. You've also got your second amendment if I get it. In 2018, we expanded the Senate majority. Remember, they said, first of all, I wasn't running. I wasn't running. It makes a difference. Wait you see what happens. We're going to take back the house. We're going to get rid of this crazy Nancy Pelosi. Kevin McCarthy's done a great job. We're going to take back the house. People are so tired of her. People are so tired. Did you hear today? The latest. So, they impeached me for perfect phone call. Perfect. It was a perfect phone call. Now they want to impeach me again if I nominate somebody as I'm constitutionally obligated to do, to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Go ahead and I want them to do that. I want them to do that. We will. We will. We will. If he puts forth a highly qualified candidate, we will impeach him. Well, I said, ""Well, I'm the only guy in the world that could get impeached for trying to fill a seat in the Supreme."" So, we're going to put up our nominee who's going to be outstanding. We're looking at five incredible jurists, five incredible people, women that are extraordinary in every way. I mean, honestly, it could be anyone. I mean, we're going to be announcing it on Friday or Saturday. Again, they say it's the most important thing and think of it. So in a single term, single term, by the end of our term, we will have nominated and had confirmed I think it'll end up being over 300 federal judges and hopefully three Supreme Court justices. Think of that. Three. Some presidents, they never get any. They last a long time, a lot of presidents get none. We've had three. It's blowing their minds. It's blowing their minds, but for the people of Ohio, this is what you want. So, it looks like we're going to have three and it's going to be very exciting. It's exciting even from me. I'm going to look forward to it. Probably Saturday, we will announce the nominee and it's somebody that you're going to have great respect for, great respect. Thank you. Big stuff. That's a big thing. They set the course of our country for many years to come, whether it's on life or the second amendment or so many other things, they set the whole course of the country. Very important position, the most important. Joe Biden has refused to list the names of his potential justices because he knows they're too extreme to withstand any form of public review. If Joe Biden and the Democrats take power, they will pack the Supreme Court with far left radicals who will unilaterally transform American society far beyond recognition. They will mutilate the largest figure the constitution and oppose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box. So, they don't want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far left radicals. If he does something even towards left of center, which would be acceptable, I guess, we have no choice. If he did that, he would lose the left. So, he's going to have to put in radicals. So he doesn't want to show who his judges are. I've shown a list, I have a double list, about 45 from which I will only pick, but he doesn't want to do that, because if you found out who he was going to pick, he would be unelectable. Hopefully, he's going to be unelectable anyway. We're going to find out. So, he wouldn't be able to survive a Joe Biden. You wouldn't be able to survive. We've been calling it socialism. I don't think it's socialism. I think it's a step beyond what they're talking about. You look at Portland, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, you look at Baltimore and Oakland. These are Democrat run cities that are horrible in crime. There's no law and order, no cash bail, no anything. You know what? The Republican cities are running great. They're running great. So, we're going to get it all changed around. We went into Minneapolis, we solved the problem like you wouldn't believe. What did it take? You saw it. What did that take? I would say probably 30 minutes. Right? They should have called us in about seven days earlier. How about the reporter? He gets up there, behind him is a burning city. I never saw anything like it. He's saying, ""There are really no protests here. This is very friendly."" We call this a friendly protester because you're not supposed to have political rallies. You're not supposed to have anything. The only thing you can have is thousands of people running down a street burning stores, looting, doing what … That's okay, because that's protesting, but we'll call this a friendly protest, but your children will be robbed of their future and the damage will endure for generations to come- … future the damage we'll endure for generations to come. We have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country in my opinion. And a lot of that's got to do with the fact that we're going to have one extra, but we didn't think this was going to happen. But I used to say just a week ago, ""We're going to have one, two, three, four, and maybe even five, the next President, and the Supreme Court is going to be a tremendous factor."" A lot of people said that's the reason I won so easily in the Electoral College last time. 306, 306 to 223. ""He will not get to 270."" Remember? ""He will not get to 270. This will be a short evening for Donald Trump. Oh, good riddance. Thank God we got rid of him. Oh, this is going to be great."" And then that problem happened. ""Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio."" Remember the one, she was crying? She was crying. ""Donald Trump has won Ohio."" But it wasn't winning Ohio, it was by the margin. ""Where the hell?"" he said, ""Where did this margin come from?"" They opened the polls. Then they closed the polls. Normally you have to wait hours, unless it's a total runaway. And they said, ""Ah, the polls and the doors are closed in Ohio. Donald Trump has won."" And they go, ""Oh my God. But wait a minute. He won by nine points. What the hell's going on over here?"" Then they said, ""Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the state of Georgia. Donald Trump has won North Carolina, South Carolina."" Remember that? Was that the most exciting evening, really? Remember? And it's not Donald Trump. It's you. It's all of us. They use the name Donald Trump. It's all of us have won. And this one's going to be even better because nobody has done, and then don't even challenge it, the fake news, nobody has done in three and a half years what we've done. We've rebuilt our military. Two and a half trillion dollars. We've taken care of our vets. We have choice, we have accountability. We can fire people now when they're not treating our vets right. We couldn't do that before. They could treat our vets terribly. We have accountability. Nobody has done what we've done for our vets. 91% approval rating at the VA. 91%, the highest ever. So nobody's done it, and that's why I think this is going to be the most important of all. I used to say, ""Well, I don't know. How does it compare to 2016?"" I just gave that up. This is the most important election. You know why? Two reasons. Number one, that's over with, the hell with it. The hell with it. But the truth is it's got a seat in, and we have a lot of new things including additional, substantial, middle income tax cuts and other tax cuts, and tremendous regulation cuts. And we're finishing up with our military. We're building Space Force. The wall is going incredibly. You remember the wall? They don't talk about the wall anymore, the fake news. Once we started building it, if you think that was easy to build the wall, we had an entire party that would die for the fact, and I made a terrible mistake in the wall, instead of telling you, ""We're going to build a wall, we're going to build a wall,"" the Democrats formed, it was very tough, but I got it. I'm a real estate developer. You can always get money. You learn we have a lot of little pockets. We had a lot of big pockets. But the military was great. The Army Corps of Engineers were great. So we're up to 330 miles of wall. We're doing 10 miles a week, and we're going to be finished with the wall very soon. And it's exactly the wall, the little more expensive wall, they want like nice, expensive, but exactly what border patrol wanted. We're building them the exact wall that they want. We can't give them any excuses. We can't give them any excuses. But it's true, they used to talk about the wall all the time because they never thought I'd be able to get a bill. Once I got it going, got it built, I got the financing, we won a lot of lawsuits, by the way, we won a lot of lawsuits. They sued us. Pelosi was suing us. Congress was suing us. The Senate was suing us. We won a lot of lawsuits. Once it was obvious that we won and we started building, they never talk about the wall anymore. And I made a terrible, terrible mistake because I had to work my ass off to get that thing built. You have no idea. You have no idea. You have no idea. But I should have said, the mistake, I should have said when I talked to these big crowds, and the crowds are getting bigger, there's more enthusiasm now than we ever had four years ago, but I should have said, instead of, ""We will build a wall,"" I kept, ""We will build a wall,"" place would go crazy, I should have said, ""We will not build the wall. Under no circumstances, will we build a wall,"" the Democrats would have given us all the money we wanted. It's true. It's true. And then they would have said, ""See, he didn't keep his campaign promise."" These people are sick. The Biden nominated justices will shred our Second Amendment, eliminate the right to self defense, and allow the government to confiscate your privately owned firearms. You know that. Put in other language, they will end your Second Amendment. And they will do that. By the way, if I wasn't here, you wouldn't have a Second Amendment right now. That would be gone. I hate to say it. I'm the only thing standing between you and chaos, I'm telling you. And Second Amendment and all of the other things. Biden's justices will remove the words ""under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance. Did you see that? Did you see it? They said, ""No, we'd never remove. And I saw it, they're doing the Pledge of Allegiance. And I said, ""Oh, it must be a typo."" They left the words ""under God"" out of the Pledge of Allegiance, the Democrats. And I said, ""Oh, there's a typo. Typo, they made a mistake. What a stupid mistake. Can you believe it? That guy's in big trouble. What a stupid mistake."" And then I heard it a second time. They did the same mistake. That's what they're doing. They're going to take God out of everything just like they want to knock down the statue of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. That's never happening. It's never happening. A lot of these Democrats states, you see it, the churches are closed. They don't want our churches to open. You can have a riot where you kill people in the streets. 25,000 people don't have to wear a mask, nothing. They can march down the streets, step on each other's face, they can do whatever the hell they want, that's okay. But you can't go to church. They have ideas, they have plans, and it's never happening with me as your President. That I can tell you. And you see it, they want to tear down crosses from public spaces. You see it. Since I signed a little law, they were ripping down a lot of statues about four months ago, and I said, ""Do we have any laws, like old laws when they was strong, when we were smart, when we were tough?"" ""Sir, we have one, sir."" A General came in. ""What's the law, General?"" ""Sir, there was a law from quite a while ago, 10 years in prison."" They didn't use the word jail, prison. Prison's a tougher word. I said, ""What do you mean, 10 years?"" ""You get 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue or if you knock down a monument."" I said, ""General, let me see that sucker, please. Bring that to my office."" And we revived it because you can't get that approved by Congress. They would never. Today in Congress, you'd do it, they'll give you half a day in a hotel someplace. So 10 years. So they were having a big march on Washington in two days and I signed this new law. We updated it, and it was 10 years. You get 10 years in prison. You touch, you knock down a monument. And there's no games. This is the old days. This is the days when we had strong laws, when we had real laws, when we had real politicians that knew how to make laws. So here's the thing. So they weren't going to come in, they were actually looking to knock down the statue of a man named Thomas Jefferson. That's not too good. They had obliterated a lot of different things. And so I had a news conference. I announced that I'm signing a law that anybody that knocks down a monument or a statue gets 10 years in jail. And the police in Washington, and we had National Guard, we had Secret Service. We were all ready for them. We were ready for them. And the time came, there's was only a problem, nobody showed up. You know why? 10 years was too much. 10 years was too much. It's amazing the way. Isn't it amazing the way it all works? So instead they burned down Portland. I speak to the Governor. The mayor is hopeless. He's a hopeless, poor guy. They chased him out of his apartment, and he still thinks they're wonderful people. They're burning down his city. But I want to go in there with the National Guard so bad. It would take us 15 minutes to solve the problem. When they heard in Seattle that we were going in, we were going in the next day, the guys just walked away. They left. That was the end of it. We had nothing to do. But they want to ban all prayer in public schools and require taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion. Biden's justices will erase national borders, they don't want borders, protect sanctuary cities, and compel the unlimited entry of foreign nationals. And if you look at some of these jihadist nations, no thank you. Somebody said, ""That's not nice. That's not politically correct."" I said, ""That's okay."" They'll clip all the police departments, free violent criminals, shield foreign terrorists, and declare the death penalty unconstitutional, even for the most depraved mass murderers who kill women and children. That's what they want. They don't want any death penalty. Not for the Boston Bomber, not for anybody. You see the Boston Bomber, they're still trying this guy, what he did to so many lives. He killed people, ruined so many families, ruined so many lives. And by the way, they want the Boston Bomber to be able to vote. You know that. In three and a half years under my administration, we've secured America's borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and brought jobs and factories back to the great state of Ohio. I love Ohio. I love Ohio. I don't know what it is. I was told by Bob and some of the Congressmen that are here, we have some great ones, I'm going to introduce them in a second, but I was told that they're not even trying for Ohio. You know why? Because I love you and you love me, and that's the way it is. That's the way it is. Thank you. I love you too. It's very interesting. So somebody in the fake news media did a story yesterday because there's crazy chances going on. They have too about the seat and all that. But there was another chant that's happening at all these rallies. We're having massive rallies. We're in Minnesota. We had a tremendous crowd. Wisconsin, tremendous. Pennsylvania, every one of them. I mean, in all fairness, it's like this, everyone. But this rant is going on like it's crazy. And it's, ""We love you. We love you. We love you,"" and you know what? I don't want to say it. I'm just saying, they have not been able to find in the history of politics in this nation, even we loved Ronald Reagan, but they have not been able to find where people broke out and said, ""We love you,"" about, I guess I have to call myself a politician. I don't feel like a politician. How nice is that? I never heard it. I've been to a lot of different speeches and rallies. I've never heard crowds go, ""We love you."" But you know why? We love you. I love you. But you know why? Because, again, nobody has done what we've done. Ohio had the best year in its history last year. We had a great year. And next year, assuming we win, which I hope we're going to win, but if we win, you're going to have a year next year. First of all, take a look at the third quarter. It's going to be announced the numbers just before the election. They'll come out three days before the election. And I'll tell you what, I'll bet on the numbers, even though Crazy Nancy and these people don't want to give any stimulus, they don't want to give anything. They want to keep a lot of states closed wherever they can. You know what they're going to do? They're going to announce they're going to be opening on November 4th. There'll be open. All these closed states, they're going to be open on November 4th. One of them blue and a teacher's union. Did you see it? ""No, we don't want to open now. We don't want to open. The pandemic. We don't want to."" We're rounding the turn on the pandemic. Vaccines are coming soon. ""But we don't want to open. Around November 4th we're going to open."" This person that's a judge of a union said that. That was not good. I think they'll get rid of her quickly. I'm also proud that we have successfully brought back the Big 10 and the Ohio State Buckeyes. You better have a good year after all of that. You have a good team, right? Good coach. Good team. Good everything. You have a good team. You always have a good team. But there was a case, what do I know? I said, ""How's it going? Everything good? Are you struggling?"" They said, ""Sir, Sleepy Joe Biden did an ad that you,"" me, ""that you closed football."" I said, ""What do you mean I closed? I didn't close."" The guy did an ad. It's called disinformation. It's called the opposite of what the fact is. Not only didn't I close it, I didn't think about it too much, okay? The states should all be open. But I heard about Big 10 football, and because of this ad, I said, ""Hey, wait a minute. I have an idea."" It was a fake ad, just like the ad on the grave sites, and that allows me to say that this man is a gross incompetent. He has no idea. Because now, see, I would never talk like that, but when I saw that horrible thing, and nobody's done more for the military than I have, when I saw that horrible ad, ""An anonymous source has said that Donald Trump said this,"" I have 28 people now that have come forward saying it's a total lie, they don't care, so they did an ad, once they did that, I said, ""Well, now the gloves are off."" Let's face it, Joe Biden is incompetent. He always was even in prime time. he was incompetent in prime time. And now he's really incompetent. But because of the ad, I said, ""It's very interesting, that ad, it's very interesting. Let me call up the Commissioner."" I had called up the Commissioner, very good guy, and I said, ""Commissioner, what can we do to get Big 10 football back?"" ""Well, I don't know."" And we started a little thing, the Commissioner and myself, one of my guys, he's fantastic, and within a few days, it started getting talked about, and then we kept it going and we helped him with some testing because we have the greatest testing in the world. We get no credit for it. We've tested almost 100 million people. India is second with 38th and they have 1.5 billion people, slightly more than you. But I will tell you, so all of a sudden they have schools. Then looked like it was going to open without Michigan and without a couple of states. And then all of a sudden the pressure became so great, and the full league is opening now and it's going to be very exciting. And I will tell you, it's not a question of taking credit, but truly we were the ones that did that. I mean, it was. I'll tell you when I do it and when I don't. But it was closed, it was gone, it was announced that it was closed. And what really spurred me on was when Sleepy Joe announced that I was the one that did it. I said, ""I didn't even know it was closed."" But once I found out it was, I called the Commissioner. He was really good, I tell you. And we called a couple of the top people at the universities and they got it going. It looked like we had seven schools, eight schools. All of a sudden, everybody fell into line. I think they're all open now. Every one of them is participating. So I want to thank the Commissioner. I want to thank all of those schools. May the best team win. In other words, Ohio State. That's a good team. You know who the best proponents were? The players and especially the parents of the players. These kids have a short window to get into the NFL to create some excitement and how good they are. And you have a lot of potential players, but they couldn't play football. And they said, ""We're safer on the field than we are staying at home,"" and they meant it. And we did something and I'm happy about it. So enjoy the football, enjoy it. Under 16 years of Presidents Obama and Bush, median household income rose only $2,945. So remember that. That's 16 years, 2009, so let's say 3000. Under three years of President Trump, it rose almost $7,000. So think of that, 16 years. Three years, achieving the highest median income in the history of our country. In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any President in the history of our country. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world and we are doing it again. We're building it again. I see the signs ""Make America Great Again,"" so I say this, it's called now ""Make America Great Again. Again"". Because we did it and then we had to close it up. We saved millions of lives. If we didn't do that, you would have had three million people. It would have been terrible. It's terrible anyway. They shouldn't have allowed it to happen, China. To defeat the China Virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War Two. Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate- Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that. That's remdesivir and all of the things, the plasma, all different things. Where do you see what's coming out? Europe is almost 30% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. That's before today's big breakout. You know they had a big breakout in Europe and they keep saying in the fake news, they keep saying about, ""Oh, Europe, Europe, Europe."" Well, we're doing better than Europe. I hate to see what happened, and it had a big impact on the market today because it was a bad thing. But they had a big hit and they'll take care of it. They know how to do it. They'll take care of it. We're working very closely with Europe and other countries, including on the vaccine. We have three vaccines right now that are right there. They're right at the starting gate and they're going to be fantastic. So it's good. With Biden, if you had that regime, you'd be three years away because it would have never gotten out of the FDA. What we've done in a very safe manner is amazing. Now remember this, Biden was in charge of the swine flu, right? It's called the H1N1. Remember he calls it the N1H1. I said, ""No, no, no, no."" H comes before the N. It's so easy. But he goes, ""The N1H1."" We say, ""No."" But it's the swine flu. Maybe we just call it the swine flu. He did such a gross, horrible job on that. His own man who was in charge of it said they didn't have a clue. They didn't know what they were doing. It was a much less lethal disease and they lost many, many people. Many, many people. It was totally incompetently. And now I got this guy standing up. Well, we're giving him advice. His own guy that ran it. Did everybody see this? They're saying they didn't have a clue what they were doing. It was so bad. I don't know why the hell he said it, to be honest with you. Who would say that? Maybe because he was honest. Does that make sense? Now Biden gets up and he's saying to do the same things as we've already done. He basically took our plan and he said, ""This is what you should do."" But we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world and the fastest economic recovery by far of any Western nation by far. Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1.9 million jobs in the state of Ohio. You know that? He knows it. He's got one of them. He's got one of them. Through operation warp speed, we're developing these great vaccines. And that's going to be… Literally, these will be done in record time. Like nobody's ever done it before. On November 3rd, Ohio will decide whether we end the pandemic and return to record prosperity or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden and his group of incompetence to delay the vaccine, shut down the country. He actually suggested that he would shut down the country. We now know the disease. We didn't know it. Now we know it affects elderly people with heart problems and other problems. If they have other problems, that's what it really affects. That's it. You know, in some States, thousands of people, nobody young below the age of 18, like nobody. They have a strong immune system. Who knows? Take your hat off to the young because they have a hell of an immune system, but it affects virtually nobody. It's an amazing thing. By the way, open your schools. Everybody open your schools. Sleepy Joe Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax site, ban American energy, destroy the suburbs, give free healthcare to illegal aliens. How about that one? You know the bad part about that? We all have heart. We want to take care of people. Probably that is everybody's going to come to the United States. People that weren't even thinking about it, they're going to say, ""Oh man, these idiots are giving free healthcare, free college education. They're giving free everything. They're giving a Rolls Royce to every family that enters through the Southern border."" Remember I said that jokingly and CNN said, ""He misrepresented. They are not getting a Rolls Royce."" I agree. Now they're sick. They are sick. And indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies. They're doing that. We're stopping it. To combat the toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we're launching a pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and we are getting better and better all the time. We got to. No party can lead America that will not teach our children to love America. Biden's running mate, Kamilla. Who likes Kamilla? Does anybody like her? She was the most failed candidate. I mean, she started off good. And every week she went down, down 15 points, 12 points, 11 points, 9 points, six points, five points, four points, two points. Didn't she leave at about two or one? She was heading down to the basement. She was so mean to him. I felt sorry for him. No, I did. I felt sorry. So she called them everything from a racist to a MeTooer. He was MeToo. He was a part of the MeToo generation. What she called him, what she said. So I brilliantly said, ""Well, he can't pick Pocahontas because she was too nasty. How nasty was she to Bloomberg? Was she unbelievable? Boy, he was standing there. What happened? What happened? No, actually. What happened? Mini Mike. He's another beauty. He's a real beauty. Mini Mike, what happened? What the hell happened? He hit her so hard. Remember? She hits him with about 30 different things, and I'm not talking about our president. He thought she was talking about me. Can you believe it? And I'm not talking. I'm talking about you. He said, ""Get me out of here. Get me out of here."" And now he wants to buy his way back into the Democrat party. He wants to buy his way back into the Democrats. He hasn't taken enough abuse. If I were him, I'd sort of either ride it out or stay with the good Trump economy and get even richer. Biden's running made even urged supporters to help the bail riders out of jail. You saw that? Including one who attempted to murder a police officer and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight year old child. Now they're trying to free them on bail. They're putting up the money to get them out by this plan to appease the domestic terrorist. And that's what it is. My plan is to arrest the domestic terrorist, and that's what we're doing for many people in jail. Many people. Remember what I told you about the monuments? This is remembrance. Isn't it beautiful? We don't see that anymore. Have you seen a monument knocked down recently? No, we don't see it anymore. I don't know. We want to rip down Abraham Lincoln. It got to Lincoln. First, it was not too many people heard of him. Confederate soldiers, et cetera. You say, ""Hey, look, do it through a process."" But they started hitting Lincoln. Then they hit Gandhi. Now Gandhi was about peace. Gandhi just wanted peace. Leave me alone. Peace, peace, peace. Let's rip them down. They're sick people. The Democrat party's war on cops has already led to a surge in vicious murders in Democrat control cities costing countless black lives. If Biden and the left gain power, they will dismantle police departments nationwide. I'll tell you, the community that's most hurt, most hurt by what they're doing and there is the black community, the Hispanic community. And we're doing great in the polls with the black community and the Hispanic community. And the Asian community. We're doing great. In fact, we did so well last night on one poll, they said it must be a typo. They did. It must be an error. It wasn't. It's no error. You're going to find out on November 3rd it's no error. As president, I always stand and I will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. They're great people. They're very brave people. Not easy, and they don't get support. We have to give them back their dignity. We have to let them do their job. That's very simple. They're great. We're joined tonight by two high school football players. They became very, very famous. They became more famous than President Trump. They were beautiful. I watched them running through the crowds with those flags. Here's some place, I don't know, you got a lot of people here. We're going to try and figure it out. Hold up your flag. Jared Bentley and Brady Williams, who were recently suspended from their high school football team after displaying flags in support of our police and first responders on the anniversary of September 11th attacks. Where are they? Come up here, fellas. Come up. Come up here. Come up here. Secret Service is thrilled about this. See, these young kids can hop over the fence like it's nothing. Come up here. They're good looking kids. I want to congratulate you. You become famous. They're going to go to Hollywood. They're going to become movie actors right now. Right? You feel good about it? How's your team doing? How's your team? How's it doing? He said it could be better. You know what? You're doing great. And everybody out here loves you and they appreciate you. You did a great job. Good job, fella. Good job. Good luck. Is your arm okay? Good. You all right? Good. Good guys. Good guys. Jared and Brady, thank you for supporting the heroes in our law enforcement. We all love you. I'm telling you. You really set something up that's incredible, and thank your parents for letting you do it. I watched. You ask your parents approval. Isn't that nice? You know what the father said? ""You better do it."" Right? That's great. Thank you very much, fellas. Great job. Really great job. Country has a lot of respect. Speaking about warriors, we're also joined tonight by some great, great congressmen who are warriors and they represent Ohio so well and they love you and they love our country. Representative Bob Latta. Thank you, Bob. Great job. They like you, Bob. That's very good. Good job, Bob. Thank you very much. Congressman Warren Davidson. You know Warren. Thank you, Warren. Great job, Warren. Congressman Mike Turner. A great lawyer, actually. Thank you, Mike. Great job, Mike. You're really great. Ohio treasurer Robert Sprague. Robert, thank you. Thanks. Good treasurer. Ohio auditor Keith Faber. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, Keith. Ohio House speaker, Bob Cupp. Where is he? Thank you, Bob. Great job. Ohio Senate president, Larry Obhof. Thank you. Thank you, Larry Obhof. Larry is a good man. How's it going, Larry? Good. You're doing a good job. Huh? You're doing good. How are we doing, Larry? Is it going good? You're right about that. You're doing a great job. Thanks, Larry. I appreciate it. Ohio GOP chairman Jane Timken. She's unbelievable. Thank you, Jane. How are we doing, Jane? How's it going? How does it compare to four years ago, Jane? Up higher. All right. Good. Good. I think we are. I think we are. A friend of mine that I'll tell you, this is the greatest optimist. When I thought we had to be down, we lost a lot of the top, top support. The head of the Republican party, little things like that. I said, ""We don't have a head of the Republican party. He left because you had a terrible governor in this state."" Terrible. Your previous governor was terrible. He was terrible. I'll tell you, I got this man. I didn't know him. Within about a week, I said, ""Man, this guy's a big optimist."" And he was right. He called it right to the thing. He ran my campaign. When he came back for the second time, we had him in a high position. I said, ""Bob, I think you're great. You're doing a great job. I want you back in Ohio. We have to do it again."" Bob Paduchik. Where's Bob? Thank you. Thank you, Bob. Get over here, Bob. Thank you, Bob. He wants no glamor. He wants no glory. He just wants to win. He called it right down to the bone. We had a rough couple of days. I said, ""Bob, how we doing?"" ""You went up two points."" I said, ""You got to be kidding."" But we did. So much evolves around Ohio and it's just a state that we have a relationship with. It's a great state. We've done a great job for you and you've done a great job for us. So we appreciate it very much. Thank you. Together, we've spent the last four years reversing the damage done by the Democrats and Joe Biden over a 47 year period. Think of it. He's always talking about, ""You should have done this. You should have done that."" He really just left office. It's not that long ago, right? He's been there for years and years and now he should have done. He's never going to do anything. He's never going to do anything. Guy is a stone cold loser. Biden supported every globalist sellout of Ohio workers for over a half a century, including NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the disaster known as TPP and how about the Paris Climate Accord? That's another beauty. I'll tell you, that was designed to hurt our country. You would have lost trillions of dollars, closed your factories all over the place. In the meantime, China didn't kick in for another 10 years. The whole thing was a rigged deal. I tell you, I said, ""I'm going to get killed for this one, but we're going to terminate."" And you know what? The people got it right away. Everybody understood. That was another rip off of our country. This state lost one in three manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters. Joe Biden is a shameless phony who pretends… He doesn't have a clue. What the hell? We're talking like he knows. He's got guys around him that are pretty smart. They're radical left. He's going to do whatever they tell him to do. He pretends to care about blue collar workers. After spending more than five decades in Washington, he tells me, ""Why didn't you do this? Why didn't you do that?"" You see these fake commercials. ""Why didn't you do it?"" I said, ""I've only been here three and a half years. This guy has been here for 47 years. He didn't do anything."" My actions saved countless jobs across Ohio and here in Toledo, the home of the Jeep, right? The home of the Jeep. That's good. That's a great brand. They've done a great job with Jeep. Jeep. Everyone loves Jeep. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to Ohio when we ended the NAFTA nightmare. I proudly signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement in July. That's a big difference. Like day and night. It's working out great too. It's working out great. You know how I know that it's a good deal for us? Because they don't like it. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of Ohio jobs. We achieved American energy. We passed record tax cuts and regulations. Our energy independence is incredible. We have now energy independence. We don't have to be in these far away lands anymore. Now we'll be there to help certain allies that have been great, but we don't have to be. Since my election, natural gas production in Ohio has surged 63%. They want to close it up. By the way, you do know they want to close it up. They want to close up all fracking natural gas ever. They want to close it up. This would kill at least 700,000 Ohio jobs. Probably more than a million. While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas and Ohio workers will continue leading the way. I just left the great state of Texas, and I talked to a lot of people like this, a great crowd of people. We have tremendous support all over the country. I'll tell you what. These people are great. And here's the platform that they have. Sleepy Joe Biden. No oil, no religion, no God, and no guns. Now I'm in Texas. It's a really rough thing in Ohio, but now we're talking Texas. No oil, that doesn't work well in Texas, right? No guns. That doesn't work well in Texas. No God. Look what they're doing to the churches and everything. That doesn't work. No God. No religion. That doesn't work well. You would have to be George Washington with your running mate would be Abraham Lincoln. Okay. Your VP candidate. And you'd still lose very big. And then they say- … and you'd still lose very big. And then they say, ""Yeah, he's doing okay. He's two up in Texas."" They said it last time too, that Texas is even, four years ago. And everybody said, ""No, I think Trump is killing it."" We'd have stadiums with 25,000, 30,000 people, much more that couldn't get in. We'd have 40,000, 50,000 people outside and they'd say I was even. We won in a landslide, just like we won this state, in a landslide. You know the expression they use, ""Texas is in play."" You know what ""in play"" means? It could go either way. And guys would get on there and say, ""I don't think so."" And then that night again, ""The polls in Texas have closed. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas."" I mean, the whole thing is crazy. It's crazy, it's crazy. You know what they do? It's suppression polls. They try and depress you. They try and make you unhappy so you go out to dinner with your wife, your husband, you go out to dinner, ""Darling, let's have dinner. It's so sad. We love Donald, but he just can't make it. He can't make it. Let's go out, have dinner. We'll come home and watch the results."" Except 2016 came and nobody did that, they all went out and voted and we kicked ass. Tell me, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? Did you ever see the ratings, the combined ratings? I think the biggest ever. But was that the most exciting? 2016, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military, including more than $6 billion in contracts. I'll tell you what, you like the word pronounced Lima or Lima, because I saved Lima. And I tell you what, I saved Lima. I came here and they were going to close that plant in Lima. They were going to close the tank plant. It was done. And I said, ""Why are we closing a tank plant?"" And I got a couple of calls from my friends, the Congressman right here. And I got calls. And Jim Jordan called me. Do you like Jim Jordan? He's great. And I looked at this army tank plant in Lima. I said, ""Why are we closing it?"" And I saw the people building the tanks and the technology's incredible. And if you ever closed it, you'd never be able to open a thing like that again. So I overrode the generals, I overrode everybody, and now we're making a record number of tanks in that plant and it's absolutely thriving. But we had tremendous success. We took 100% of the ISIS caliphate and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. We took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many other people. Qasem Soleimani is dead. He's dead. I withdrew from last administration's disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. They paid $150 billion, plus $1.8 billion in cash. You know they got? Nothing. They got nothing. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Every president for many, many decades said they were going to do it. They never did it. They never did it. They didn't have the guts to do it. They campaigned on it, they were all going to do it. Then they got there, there was a lot of pressure put on them. A lot of pressure put on me. Every leader was calling all over. ""Please don't do it. Please don't do it. Mr. President, please don't do it. Don't do it. Don't move it. Just leave it the way it is. It's okay."" But I promised and I said, ""I'm going to do it."" And then I got calls from the biggest people in the world. Kings, I got calls from presidents, from prime ministers, ""Please, please don't tell it."" Then I got calls, ""Please have him call me back me,"" me. I said, ""Look, tell everybody I'm out for three days. I'm not going to be able to call them back."" I had a news conference, we announced it. Then I called everybody back. ""Hey, how you doing? How's everything going? Everything going good?"" ""Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel, but it's too late. You already did it."" And we did it and we got it done and nobody else got it done. And it's something we had to do. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And instead of endless wars, we are forging peace all over the Middle East. And you saw that. And I'm the only man that got nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and I didn't get any press. They wouldn't. For two of them. Last week, I'm not bragging about it, I'm just saying, I'm the President of the United States because of Kosovo-Serbia, they've been killing each other for years, I worked out a deal for them. I got nominated. And then Israel with Bahrain and UAE, and many more to come. I mean, they all want to do it. We'll have peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand. No blood. We're going to have peace in the Middle East. So I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. And I told this story last night. Should I tell it or not? Should I? Yes. She wants me to do it. So I go home to our great First Lady. I said, ""First Lady, you're going to be so proud of me tonight. I was nominated not once but twice for totally separate events by different people."" Great people. ""First lady, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize."" I was like this. ""I was nominated."" It's a big deal for our country, right? And she said, ""Oh, that's good."" I said, ""Let's turn on the evening news. Let's watch it. This is going to be a big show tonight. Get ready."" And NBC, which is one of the most crooked, one of the worst newscasts, and I'm talking about normal NBC, not MSDNC. MSDNC is the worst. So I turned on NBC with Lester Holt, another beauty. And they start with a hurricane and then they went to something, and something else. And I'm saying, ""First Lady, this is getting a little embarrassing. We're 20 minutes into a half hour show. They haven't mentioned the Nobel Peace Prize."" And then it went through the whole show and they never mentioned. Then I got nominated for a second one. They never mentioned. And when Barack Obama, Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, now when Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, he didn't know why he was nominated. It was like right at the very beginning. He didn't do anything. He did nothing and he got nominated. It was the biggest story I've ever seen. But that's okay. In the meantime, we're President and they're not. No, that's right. You would think if you nominated for the Nobel Prize, you'd get maybe half a second. The First Lady, she said, ""Sorry, darling. That's the way it goes, isn't it?"" Joe Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He voted for the Iraq War disaster. He backed the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. And he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for our country. ""Oh, it's really great."" If it were up to Sleepy Joe, bin Laden and Soleimani would be alive today, ISIS would be on a rampage, Iran would control the Middle East, and China would be the dominant power anywhere in the world. And I want to tell you, if you go back a few months before this pandemic, we were gaining, gaining, gaining. We had an insurmountable lead on China. I always heard they were going to catch us by 2019 for 10 years. We were so far beyond, we were doing much better than they were. The Biden agenda would obliterate our economy. He destroyed social security, destroyed protections for pre-existing conditions. That's what he's going to do, drain your Medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants. He would end our travel ban to jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by, listen to this, over 700%. And this is the manifesto with Bernie Sanders, with Crazy Bernie. He made this deal with Crazy Bernie. And by the way, a lot of the Crazy Bernie voters last time, four years ago, voted for Trump because of trade, because the one thing they do understand, that our country has been off for years. Biden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools. Very important to have them. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. They're totally against it. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just, in conclusion, first of all, it's been a great honor to be with you. This is, really, it's a great state. They're great people. I really mean it. No, I really mean it. Get out there on November 3rd. We've got to win this one big. This is a bad, bad ideology. This is probably a step beyond socialism. I really think in many ways, it's communism we're talking about. This is a step beyond. Socialism's no good. Communism's really bad. But get out there on November 3rd and let's show him your stuff and show them the stuff of all of us. So, in concluding, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end the reliance, this ridiculous, crazy reliance on China, and all of these far away lands once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police. And by the way, thank you, police. Thank you, law enforcement. Increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, stupid, endless, foreign wars. We will maintain America's unrivaled military. Our military might has never been like it is right now because of what we've done. And we had no choice, and hope to God we never have to use it, because if you would ever see the power of what we've done over the last three years, it's almost better for you not to see it. We are the envy of every power, every country in the world. We have weapons that nobody ever even thought possible. And just as I said, hope to God we never have to use them. And the way we don't have to use them is to keep that kind of strength. Nobody's going to be talking to us. We're going to have peace through strength, and it's all made in the U.S.A. Made in the U.S.A. We'll end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. I've already signed it into law. Kicks in on January 1st. It's going to cut your bills down to a level that you wouldn't believe. That doesn't mean the drug companies and the hospital and corporations are happy with me. But that's okay. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs by 50%, 60% and 70%. Big pharma does not like me too much. They're taking ads about me that are so bad, but you get it, you understand it. They're not too thrilled with me, including the rebates. The rebates go back to you. The rebates before went back to very rich people. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That's what's happening. NASA is again the leading space station anywhere in the world. There's nothing like a space center, what we've done. And there was grass growing in the runways when I took over three and a half years ago. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ""In God we trust."" For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great state of Ohio. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get everybody, and get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. And in your state, in Ohio, early voting has already begun and don't wait. And when you see them cheating on the other side, I don't say if, when, when you see them cheating with those ballots, all of those unsolicited ballots, those millions of ballots, you'll see them, anytime you do, report them to the authorities. The authorities awaiting and watching. From Akron to Columbus, from Cincinnati to Queen City, I know it weller than Cleveland, and from Dayton to Toledo, we inherit the legacy of generations of Ohio patriots, like Neil Armstrong, Annie Oakley, William McKinley, and the amazing Ulysses S. Grant, that's good. Nobody's stock has gone up like Grant. Nobody in the last 10 years. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and you haven't seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Ohio, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Get out and vote. Thank you."
Trump," Thank you very much, Phoenix. We love to be back. We'll be back a lot. We're going to win that election. Thank you very much. Hello, Phoenix. It's great being here in the great state of Arizona with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family, and country. Thank you. Thank you. And with your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats and we are going to win Arizona in a landslide. It's all over TV that the folks here tonight have helped a great World War II veteran into the arena. I don't know if he knows it, but he's right now the hottest celebrity in the world. I don't know what's going on here. He might even be hotter than Trump right now, I have to say. Did you see the scene? No, he's all over television. Even fake news CNN him on. They say he's a legitimate great hero of World War II. Erwin Julian. Irvin, thank you. And I asked my son Don to get a couple of hats and get some things, and give them to Erwin right now. And I want to thank you. Really, that's a great honor. And thank you for the great job you've done. An American Patriot. Thank you very much. Thank you, Don. How did Don do tonight? Okay? He's good. Good guy. And he loves this country. So this is truly an incredible time for America. We have the best economy, the most prosperous country that we've ever had, and the most powerful military anywhere in the world by far. Do you remember the good time we had a week ago at the State of the Union? You remember that, right? And that was my honor. But I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. Our country is stronger today than ever before. And after three years, of very unfair and ridiculous witch hunts and partisan Democrat crusades… It was the radical left's pathetic attempts to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy, and overthrow our entire system of government. But guess what? They failed, and our poll numbers are higher today than they've ever been before. And we're standing up to the defense of our Constitution, our freedom and democracy itself. We're doing something that's never been done in the history of our country. This movement has never taken place. Nothing like it ever. And the fake news can attest to it, because if they thought I was saying the wrong thing, it'd be out there immediately. It'd be all over the place. It'd be all over the place. Trump exaggerates. That's terrible what he says. There has never been a movement like this, and it began very early. It began in 2016 with that wonderful, beautiful night. You remember that, right? That beautiful night in November. And we're going to have another beautiful night in November. This time, it's going to be November 3rd. Get ready, November 3rd. We're coming. We're coming. So we're having great polls. You're seeing the polls, except for some of the fake ones. And if I was treated fairly… Meaning, if you were treated fairly by the fake news, we'd be up 20 points higher in the polls. There wouldn't even be a competitive election. Unfortunately, it's probably going to be competitive. But I actually think we're going to win by a lot, just like we did last time. But I really believe we'd be up 20 points. I mean, all they do is negative, negative, phony stuff. Russia, Russia, Russia. The impeachment hoax. That's a hoax. But you know, we had great support from the Republican party in the House. It was 197 to nothing. And in the Senate, it was 52 and-a-half to a half. You know what the half was? A halfwit. And while the extreme left has been wasting America's time with the hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion and creed. By the way, they turned away 21,000 people outside, so feel very good. Feel very good. We haven't had an empty seat. You know what? We haven't had… True. We haven't had an empty seat, and this is a tribute to all of us because this is a movement like nobody's ever seen. But we haven't had an empty seat since your great… and this is a great first lady. Came down the escalator with me in Trump Tower a long time ago. We haven't had an empty seat. From our rural communities to our inner cities, we're expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens. We added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. You saw that, the geniuses. You saw that. You saw that last month. They were doing predictions on one of the shows. What do you think? Well, I think 60,000. What do you think? I think 100,000. What do you think? I think 84,000. These are the ones that tell you all about how to invest. What do you think? And then they came out 225,000, the market goes up again. 225,000. 225,000. So many manufacturing jobs. So many that frankly, we're never going to come back. Remember, you need a magic wand, right? They came back. And remember this, we're paying interest. The past administration didn't pay interest. They pumped money in like it was candy. And we didn't pump money in, we took money out. And not that I was happy about that, because I disagree with it. Because frankly, if we kept the old practice which frankly, some people could dispute one way or the other, we would have been up in my opinion, another 10,000 points in the Dow. And we've set 144 records on the stock market in three years, 144 records. 144 records. Record stock market. And you know what that means? That your 401Ks are up 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. Guys come up to me. He said, ""Mr. President, I just want to thank you. My wife used to look at me like I was a total loser, sir. Every year we lost money for years and years. She said what the hell is wrong with you, Henry? And this year sir, I'm up 92%. She loves to me again. She thinks I'm a genius."" 92% 401K. ""She thinks I'm a genius, sir. She loves me again."" Shows what money can do, right? But that makes… And think of this. Seven million new jobs since we were elected, we were elected. And when I took over, ISIS was all over the place. And we immediately started. We have destroyed 100% of the ISIS caliphate. We have killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi is dead. And we just took out the world's top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. And the fake news doesn't want to tell you that. They don't want to tell you that. They don't want to tell you. In fact, do you remember the dog? Great dog, Conan. When we took out, right? We love Conan. Conan's a tough dog. But when we took out al-Baghdadi, Conan… Remember this? Conan got more publicity than President Trump. That's okay. They were looking for al-Baghdadi for 16 years. We found him and we took him out. We killed another one last week. The head of Al-Qaeda. He was gone, dead. And America is respected again, respected like never before. We're respected again. We're no longer the laughingstock that gets taken advantage by every country, including by the way, our allies, who in many cases take a bigger advantage than our enemies. I will tell you that. They take big advantage, but not so much anymore. We're winning. We're winning like never before. Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They hate the fact that we're winning. We're winning big. We're winning, winning, winning. And that is why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement. They're joining our great Republican party in droves. You see it all the time. I just spoke to some of your leaders. He said, ""This is unbelievable what's happening. This is unbelievable."" You know, there have never been rallies like that. Sleepy Joe Biden the other day had 68 people. And now they have a new member of the crew, mini Mike. Mini Mike. No boxes, we call him no boxes. And I hear he's getting pounded tonight. You know, he's in a debate. I hear they're pounding him. He spent $500 million so far, and I think he has 15 points. It just came out. Hey fake news, how many points does he have right now, 15? They won't tell you the truth. They won't tell you the truth. MSDNC, MSDNC is worse than CNN. They're owned by a company called Comcast. You can have Comcast, a bunch of phonies. But MSDNC is worse than CNN, and they're all pretty bad. You know, they just came out with a poll. They just came out with a poll a little while ago. Mini Mike was at 15, and crazy Bernie was at 31. That's a lot. And mini Mike just spent $500 million. But the DNC is going to take it away from Bernie again. That's okay, because we don't care who the hell it is. We're going to win. We're going to win. We have to. Well let me tell you, these crooked politicians, they really took away three years from us. Because despite the fact and nobody disputes it, that we've done more in three years with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and the military and the choice and everything, we've done more than any administration in history. We've done more. But think of it, think of it. We did it with phony witch hunts. We did it with the impeachment hoax over our head the whole time. We did it under circumstances that should never ever happened to another President again. True. But with your energy and enthusiasm this November, we're going to take back the House, we're going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we're thrilled to be joined tonight by some of the best, greatest. I love them. Leaders in America, Arizona leaders. I want to start. Come on up here, Governor Doug Ducey. Come on up here, Doug. Come on up here. You're going to speak in a second. Also, I call them warriors because they fought like hell. They worked with our future Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. But we have some of your great warriors. Paul Gosar, come up here, Paul. Come up here. Andy Biggs. Andy Biggs, head of the Freedom Caucus. Andy Biggs. David Schweikert. David, come up here. A big, big star. You know about that, Doug. She became this monster star. She looked with such indignation at the other side, such disgust, Debbie Lesko. He'll be running some day. You said your grandson? Wow. He'll be running someday. Arizona Senate President, you know who that is, right? Karen Fann. Come up, Karen. Arizona House Speaker, Rusty Bowers. Vice President of the Navajo nation, Myron Lizer. And Arizona Republican party State Chair, Kelly Ward. Kelly Ward, come up. And we have a lot of other leaders, but we've got to get back to speaking. Do me a favor before I introduce a very special guest, I'd like to ask your great Governor… You know, he won like by 16 points. It wasn't even a contest. You know, I'm very competitive. I want to beat him. Will you please get out to the polls so we can beat him? But he's tough to beat. Doug Ducey, say a couple of words, please. Please. These are great people, great people. Thank you very much. So you know, before I introduce somebody very important to all of us, to me… Also, I have to say with us tonight is an Arizona hockey great, a friend of mine. He's a great golfer too. He's a tough golfer. I'll tell you, he's tough to beat. He's tough as hell. And if you beat him in golf, he'll try and beat you physically. He doesn't care. He was the toughest hockey player. He was one of these guys, he could beat you one way and if he couldn't, he just beat them up, right? He'd beat him up. And he's a friend of mine. He's a great guy, Jeremy Roenik. Where's Jeremy? Where is he? Thank you, Jeremy. He's a winner. We're also joined by Donald, Jr. and Kimberly. They're great people, great. And RNC co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. And RNC finance chairman, also happens on a team called the Chicago Cubs, I shouldn't tell you that… Todd Ricketts. So finally, it's my great honor to introduce a tremendous person, a great fighter pilot. A lot of people don't know that. She's a great fighter pilot and a warrior Senate. She helped us so much during the impeachment hoax, she didn't wobble one bit, Martha McSally. You know, Martha's tough on the border. And she's working with me to strengthen our military still further, and lower your prescription drug prices. We're making a lot of progress. But her opponent, I have to say this Martha, a guy named Mark Kelly. Even the Democrats don't like him much. He wants to raise your taxes, open your borders, give away free healthcare to illegal immigrants, and he wants to obliterate your second amendment. He wants to get rid of it. The radical liberal Democrats from California and Massachusetts, they're pouring money into Kelly's campaign, because they know that he's a rubber stamp for crying Chuck Schumer, crying Chuck, and nervous Nancy wacko Pelosi. And we're going to have a new Speaker. But that's why Martha has my complete and total support and endorsement, and we have to all get out there and make sure that Martha McSally… She's a warrior. Let me tell you, you don't know. We don't know. People don't know, people. This one is tough as hell, and that's what we need. Martha McSally. Thank you. We'll be back. Thank you Martha. Well, she's right. How about that Congressman Al Green? We can't beat him, so we have to impeach him. How about that? That's not what our… as they call them, the founders. How many times did you hear the name, the founders? That's not what the founders had in mind. But we're going to have a big, big election victory. We're working to- But we're going to have a big, big election victory. We're working together. I don't think the Republican party has ever been more unified than it is right now. I really don't believe so. So whatever you can do for Martha, we need her. It's been so incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you for everything, Martha. I appreciate it. Thank you. Together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere. We're inclusive. This is the Republican party. We're inclusive. Right here in… Right? You know that. Right here in America, right here in Arizona, we've created 240,000 new jobs right here. Including over 60,000 new manufacturing and construction jobs here. Nobody thought it was possible. You've had the best year that you've ever had. Arizona, you've had the best year, the most successful year that you've ever had in the history of the country. It's the best year you've ever had. So I'm going to take all the credit away from your governor. I don't care. No, we have a great team with Doug and everybody else, but you've had the greatest year. You know that, Doug, number one year in the history of your state. It's an incredible achievement. Incredible achievement. I don't know, this has to be pretty good stuff on the debate stage. We'll talk about, ""Well, you had the best… In many states, the best year they've ever had."" Then they said, ""Let's get a new president."" I don't think that's going to work so easily. The country's had the best year it's ever had. Let's get a new president. Let's put in crazy Bernie. Let's go. Crazy Bernie. Unemployment has reached its slowest rate in over 51 years, half a century. The average unemployment rate for my administration… Think of this. The average, so we're talking about now more than three years, is the lowest for any US president in recorded history. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows, lowest in history. African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low in the history of our country. African American and Hispanic American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in 71 years. Soon to be historic. And veterans' unemployment has dropped to a record low. We're working with our veterans, we're taking care of our veterans like nobody's ever taken care of our veterans. The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached the lowest level in history. Workers without a high school diploma, you have a lot of them. They left high school. They said, ""I should have finished."" They left. They can't go back. They left. We've achieved the lowest unemployment rate without a diploma ever recorded in US history. Isn't that great? They're great numbers. Hispanic Americans right now, more than 500,000 own a home. More than 500,000 more own a home. And we've lifted 10 million people off of the welfare rolls. Think of that. 10 million people have come off of the welfare rolls. And happily. Not that we did anything. They have jobs and they love them. They're making much more money and they love getting up and going for work. If they don't like that job, they can get another one, because people are starving to get great employees right now. They're starving to get great employees. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. Median income. Think of this. This is such a big deal. Median household income reached the highest level in the history of our country. Under President Bush, in eight years it went to $450 more. Under President Barack Hussein Obama, under a period of eight years, it went to $975. Under president Donald J. Trump… Did you ever hear of him? In only three years, including regulation cuts and tax cuts… Because the other ones raise taxes. We cut taxes by the record amount. It went to $10, 000 per family. A record. A record. That's why our consumer right now, our people, they're booming with cash. That's one of the reasons our economy is doing so much better. China had the worst year in the last 67 years. Asia's doing poorly. Europe is doing poorly. The United States is doing great. We're doing the best we've ever done. The best we've ever done. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment, and these are really communities that need it the most, we created Opportunity Zones. We worked with Tim Scott, the great senator from South Carolina. His idea. He came in and saw me. I said, ""Let's give it a shot."" Nothing's worked over the years, but this has really worked. Now jobs and investment are now pouring into 168 newly designated Opportunity Zones right here in Arizona alone. From Apache to Navajo and Maricopa Counties. We're supporting working families by fighting pay. We are doing a job with paid family leave. We're doing something that nobody's ever done to this extent. Reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pocket thanks to the Republican child tax credit. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American liberty and cutting through job, killing red tape like nobody has ever cut regulations before. We've ended the war on American energy, lowering utility bills, reducing prices at the pump, and eliminating our reliance on hostile foreign suppliers. For the first time, America is now energy independent. Such beautiful words. Energy independent. We fought wars. We did everything we could. We used to take the straits and everybody else benefited. We'd them clear so that other countries could take oil from the Middle East with… That nobody paid us. Now they're starting to pay us a lot of money, folks. They took advantage of us. But we have everything we need right now. We have made such progress in the last three years with pipelines. The Keystone Pipeline, Keystone XL. I approved it. The Dakota Access Pipeline. I approved it. 48,000 jobs. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. The worst trade deals any human being has ever seen. I said, ""Who made these deals?"" The worst, stupidest deals I've ever seen. They were good for other nations. If you like other nations, that's great. But we're now putting America first. It's very simple. For years, Washington politicians took money from lobbyists, global corporations, and really, the most corrupt special interests anybody's ever seen. To ship our jobs and our factories to other countries. We lost our taxes, we lost our workers, we lost our companies, and we did nothing about it. Now we've done a lot about it because companies are pouring back in. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA, the worst deal ever made, worst trade deal ever made, and one that was almost as bad and gave China an entrance into being a rocket ship when they entered the World Trade, WTO. One of the worst deals that we participated in this. By the way, we just won $7.5 billion in a lawsuit with WTO. We weren't winning anything. We weren't winning anything, but they said, ""I think this guy's going to pull out."" They treated us so unfairly. We were always in the minority position. I mean, who the hell negotiated these deals? But they look at us and they say, ""Look, if we're not treated fairly, we're gone."" All of a sudden, we're winning all these cases. But we just won 7.5 billion. 7.5 billion. Did you know that, Doug? 7.5 billion. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America's no longer for sale. America is no longer for sale. Those days are over. Two generations of politicians came and went promising to replace NAFTA. How many times have you heard we're going to replace NAFTA? Probably the number one reason I ran for office. Are we glad I ran for office? I think so. It's funny, I was watching the different… I find it fascinating. I'm watching the different returns coming in and I'm watching as much as I can of this stuff. I love it. We all love it. If you don't love it, you're not going to do it very well. The crazy New York Times, which was a dead newspaper when I ran, it was dead as a doornail. A month before I ran, Doug, I held up a New York Times, it was like what you get thrown in your face at a supermarket. It was a thing. It just flew away. There was nothing. Now it's doing very well. But you know what? Someday we won't be here. When we're not, those papers are in big trouble. But this thing was a dead newspaper. But I was watching and they had an article this weekend about people that spent their own money and how they're doing. They have Mini Mike has spent $411 million. It's a question mark, how's he going to… I'll tell you how he's going to do. He's probably not going to get the democratic nomination. That's how he's going to do. But Mini Mike, $411. Then they had this idiot, Steyer. We call him impeachment Steyer. How did that work out, Steyer? He's another beauty. The guy worked… He spent 210 million. He got one-third of 1% in Iowa. In New Hampshire he did much better. He got less than 3%. Guy's in there for like 250 million. How did it work out, Steyer? You jerk. I never even heard of him. I never even heard of him. I turn on every time… For years, I'm turning on… Impeach him. They don't even know why. They never say why. They don't have any reason. Impeach the president. This guy spent a fortune on this stuff, so it worked out pretty good. But anyway, so then I go and I look. It has Mini Mike's… Question marks. I can give you the answer, but right now they have to have a question mark, right? Then they go down and they had other people. Some of them I like. They have Ross Perot, who honestly… It was a tough day for Bush when he joined the campaign. Because Clinton didn't win. Ross Perot took away 19% of the votes. Didn't Clinton get 41 or 43%? Give me a break. But that's okay. Whatever. But they had Ross Perot spent like 100 million, which is probably double if you bring it up to today's dollars. Then they have different people. A friend of mine who ran, Steve Forbes, he ran twice. He was in for a lot. Then they had Donald Trump. Now, this is your own money. This is your own money. I said I'd spend a lot of money on my primaries. We'll see how the hell we do. It's amazing. Once you win, money comes in. It comes in pretty fast. What's that all about? But so in the middle they had Trump, and then they had four or five that were behind me. Lot of money spent. Loss, loss, loss, loss, loss. But in the middle they have Donald Trump. It didn't say 500 million, and it didn't say 250 like this Steyer guy. It didn't say… It said 70 million of my own money. I spent 70. It said, ""Donald Trump won the presidency of the United States."" Right? We won. My father would teach me, if you could spend less and win, that's better than spending a lot and winning. Crooked Hillary spent at least three times more than we did and lost. Crooked as hell. She's crooked as hell. We have a double-sided justice. It's very unfair what's going on. Very unfair. But let's see how it all works out, folks. Let's see how it all works out. I hope you're going to be happy. I hope you're going to be happy, because there are a lot of dishonest slimeballs out there. Dishonest scum. Dirty cops, a lot of dirty cops. By the way, the FBI, those guys in that are incredible. But the ones on top, they were absolute scum. What they were trying to do, if that happened to Obama, or a Democrat, or especially a liberal Democrat, they'd be in jail for 50 years and it would have taken place two years ago already. They spied on our campaign. Remember that. After they spied, we won. Then after we won, they tried to get us out of office. It's never happened before in the history of our country, and we can't let that happen. We can never ever excuse it. We can never let them get away with that. Never let them get away with it. But we keep our promises that we work hard and our economy is great. The last month, we ended the NAFTA… Look, you saw it. NAFTA catastrophe. That's what it was. We ended that catastrophe. Again, I really ran because of NAFTA. I said, ""How stupid."" All over the place. In your state, but you go to New England, empty factories, empty buildings. Still you have empty buildings. We lost so much. We lost 60,000 factories and plants. I signed that brand new, beautiful US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, and ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Arizona. By the way, for people with the small farms and small businesses, if you love your children, you can now leave your companies, you can leave your farm, you can leave your ranch to your children, and you don't have to to pay, they don't pay a death tax. They don't pay an inheritance tax. A big deal. That's a big deal. So if you love your children, it's good. If you don't love your children, it doesn't matter. Don't leave it to them, if you don't love. If your children are no good to you, don't give them anything. Let them go out and work like hell. No, if you love… Does anybody in this incredible audience… Man, this is a big building. Does anybody not love their children? Anybody? Do I have a hand? Do I have a… There's a hand. You've got to be kidding. You've got to be kidding. So then you don't care about the tax. Okay, don't worry about it. He says, ""No, I don't care about that one."" Well, that's good. You look like a nice guy too. He's tough. You'd love to be his kid, wouldn't you? But I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Last month, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports. China will invest $250 billion a year into the United States and buy our products and create jobs. Nothing like that has ever happened before. After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. That's the way we want it. We are finally putting our country first. We are putting America first. On no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than immigration. You know it almost better than anybody. Anybody, Doug. You know it better than anybody, what they've done on your border, but we're stopping that border. That border is clogged, and we've started the big wall right in Arizona. We build a lot of wall. That's a big one. That's a big one. Top of the line. Before I came into office, the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, poisoning our children. Including, as you know very well right here in Arizona, Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border. Then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, healthcare, everything. They want to give them everything. For a long period of time, they were treated… You know this before I came. They were treated far better than our veterans were treated. Now our veterans are treated great. True. Illegal immigration costs Arizona taxpayers more than $2 billion every year. Two billion you're paying. Nearly 20% of Arizona's annual budget in general funds goes toward this big problem. For the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild our cities all throughout America, which is what we should be doing. Under my administration, we are finally taking care of our own citizens, including millions and millions of legal immigrants who follow our laws, pay their taxes, and are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities. Every day, Democrats' open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives. In Arizona alone last year, ICE officers arrested over 4,500 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. Right here in Phoenix, an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood, then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he laid dying in the street. This savage animal had previously been deported after serving six years in prison. He was in prison six years. He was there six years and nobody wants to talk about it. They want to protect them. Last year in Tucson, another illegal alien was sentenced to 10 years for repeatedly raping a vulnerable young woman. Yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens, even convicted criminals, and they support deadly sanctuary cities that release these criminal aliens directly into America's communities. Thankfully, Arizona has banned sanctuary cities. With a Republican majority in Congress, we will ban them in every state in America. 30 in the morning. I then went to California, made two speeches. I then went someplace else. I said, ""Am I finished?"" No, you've got to go to Arizona tonight and speak in front of like 25,000 people. I said, ""That's okay. That's okay."" I said, ""That's okay."" No, I said, ""That's okay,"" because I love this unbelievable energy in this crowd. But you know what? Honestly, there's tremendous energy in our nation. There's tremendous energy in our nation. Greatest nation in the world. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row, which will soon be a record. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring. The month of January saw the fewest illegal border crossings in two years. And we've ended catch and release, a horrible Democrat policy that we got terminated. Border patrol, great people, have seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever recorded in the history of our country this year. We've deported record numbers of gang members, including the worst gang of all, MS-13. Thousands and thousands of people have been thrown the hell out of our country. We've done more to secure the border than any administration in history. We're building the wall, as I said, faster than ever. It will soon be almost one new mile a day. We're looking for that. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme, taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders. How's he doing tonight? 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover of the world. Think of this, 180 million Americans are going to lose healthcare coverage under this plan. But if you don't mind, I'm not going to criticize it tonight. Let them keep going and I'll start talking about it about two weeks out from the election. Okay? Because I don't want him to change. Please don't change. Same with the Green New Deal. I don't want to talk about it, Doug, tonight. I don't want to talk about it. I came up with the name Pocahontas. Too early. But fortunately, she's self-destructed anyway. Did you ever see a phony like that? She's a phony. She lost because she couldn't keep it straight on her own heritage. She said she was an Indian. I said, "" I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none."" She said, ""Oh,"" and she panicked. She panicked, and she had a test. You know the result, 1/124th. I think I win the bet. Somewhere along the line, I think I win. No, she… I did it too early. I would have saved it, but I guess it was effective. She's essentially gone-zo, so… One of those things. While the socialist Democrats are try- … one of those things. While the socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare and your social security, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. And that's what we're getting. That's right. One of the big secrets. The Democrats won't let us say it. They want to keep that as quiet as possible. Look what they gave you, the worst healthcare. And what we've done, we've gotten rid of things that nobody could believe that was so bad for you. Everybody was happy with defending your right to keep your doctor and plan of your choice. We're making healthcare better and much, much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office, we are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive than they were, and it's better healthcare. A lot of people don't know this. People don't know this. They think that's their issue. It's not. They failed on healthcare. We're protecting people with preexisting conditions, and we always will. And by the way, we're trying to get rid of Obamacare, but we're managing it incredibly, but we're trying to get rid so we can give you a great healthcare plan and protect preexisting conditions. Remember that. We're trying to get rid of it, but while we're having it, we're managing it really much better than they did. Remember they built the $5 billion website? Remember that? It was supposed to cost $5 million. It cost $5 billion. $5 billion. I mean, you could get a kid out of high school. I have a son. He's a young boy, 13. He uses a computer. He could have given them a healthcare site. I would say he would have charged them $100, Barron Trump, and it would've worked. He's so good. ""Hi dad. How you doing, dad? How's it going?"" Bing, bing, bong. I said, ""Don't play with that while you're talking to me."" ""What's going on, dad?"" These kids are incredible, right? The kids, they make us look like babies with that. But he could have given you a great site for about $2. They spent $5 billion on a site that never worked. By the way, speaking of that, how did they do with their vote count in Iowa? And I hear, I hear, I don't want to say it. I don't want to jinx them because, of course, I want them to do well, but I do. We don't have anything. Nobody's running against us in so many states. It's sort of nice. We can save the thunder, right? But I hear that in Nevada. I'm hearing bad things about their vote count. I hear a lot of bad things are happening, like they don't know what the hell they're doing. I turned on the other night, Iowa, I wanted to see … And by the way, we set a record in the history of Iowa. We had more votes than anybody's ever had as an incumbent president. Same thing in New Hampshire. It's a good sign. It's a good sign. By a lot. By the way, by a lot. But I'm hearing that, and I hope this isn't the case because I'd like to find out who the hell won. We still don't know who won in Iowa. I heard coming over here they're still working on the count. No, no, no. He said, ""You won."" Yeah, I think we did win. I think we did. Very good. That's very good. I have to thank you, that one. That's very good. No, we did win. Look, we are winning. We're winning big. We have fake polls out there. These guys do fake polls. They are fake polls. I had a poll. It's just like it was in 2016. I'd hear these polls. I'd hear women didn't like me, and I did great with women. I hear everyone didn't like me. Nobody liked me. Nobody liked me. And then we won. Thank you, women. Nobody liked me 2016. No, no, I hear that. Remember, women didn't like him, and at the end of that he did great with women. He did great with this. He did great with everybody. We did great with everybody. Remember, 306 to 223. That's a slaughter. That's a slaughter. Remember, they said he cannot get, they used the word path. There is no path, right, to 270? I was at 269 if I did great, but they said there's no chance. But I was at 269, so I went to Maine. I love Maine. I went to Maine. Maine's cut in half. And one Maine has one. I went there four or five times. People are great. I won it. And they were right. There is no path to 270, but there was a path to 306. These people. These people. There is no path. That's right, Doug. They said there is no path, the fake news media. ""There is no path for Donald Trump."" And then they said the evening of the election, ""It's going to be a really short night for Donald Trump. Thank God, we got rid of this guy."" Because they did the exit polls going out, right? And I was even told, but a lot of people didn't want to talk about it. The highest number in history of people that said very nasty language, but I'm not going to use that name because you'll kill me if I use it. So I won't use it. It's a much better story if I use it because that's the truth. That's what they said. ""How did you vote?"" Usually, they say, ""I voted for Clinton,"" or, ""I voted for Trump."" Right? ""How'd you vote?"" ""None of your business."" See, I'm being nice, right? I'll keep it that way because otherwise we'll ruin the whole evening. They'll say, ""His language,"" right? Even this tough guy in the front says, ""I agree."" ""How did you vote?"" ""No, I don't want to tell you."" ""How did you vote?"" ""None of your damn business. I'm not going to tell you."" ""How did you vote?"" ""I'm not … "" And it was like this massive number, right? Massive. So everybody, they just didn't count that. So they said numbers are looking unbelievably well for crooked Hillary Clinton. They're looking unbelievable. This is going to be a very short evening for Donald Trump. We finally will be rid of this guy. And then the numbers started coming in. The numbers started coming in, and it started with the great state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. And then that beautiful convention center, the most beautiful stage I've ever seen. And they knew something was going on because they didn't pay the final payment for the fireworks two weeks before. Right? In fact, I went to the fireworks company, and I said, ""I'll give you five cents on the dollar for your fireworks,"" even though they were no way near where my area was. We were at a hotel in Midtown. We liked the location better than where she chose, but they built the most … we remember that beautiful stage. It was shaped like the United States of America. And by the end, it didn't look too good. Did you ever see more unhappy people? So they go, ""Donald Trump has won the great state of Florida. They go, ""Whoa, whoa, whoa."" They outspent me like five to one. Only negative ads. They're all negative. So by the time people got into the voters booth, they only knew one thing. She hated Donald Trump, but they said, ""What the hell does she stand for? What does she do?"" Every ad was a negative ad. So it tells you negative ads, at least against me, aren't so good. They can be effective. But I think they spent like $ 2 billion on negative ads. Everything was negative. So nobody knew what the hell she spent. You know, her husband said she was going to lose. Her husband's a professional. Her husband said, ""You better go to Michigan because I was there and they got a Trump/Pence sign on every lawn I've ever seen. You better go to Wisconsin, Hillary. You better go to Wisconsin."" She said, ""No, we haven't lost Wisconsin in 36 years"". ""No, no, Hillary, you got to go there. I'm telling you, I don't like what I saw."" ""No, what do you know?"" He's a professional politician. She wasn't. It's one of those little problems in life. So then it came in, and then we won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. Right? And we were leading Pennsylvania by so much that if I lost, remember at 2% of the vote left, if I lost every single vote, I win by a lot. They refused, the fake news refused to call it. I kept saying, ""We won Pennsylvania. Why don't they call it?"" It was very late in the evening when they called it because they are fake, they're crooked. They are fake. And I said, ""Why don't they call Pennsylvania?"" But some beautiful things happened. And by the way, Ohio, we won by one of the largest margins ever. The great, great, great state of Ohio. Remember? Remember, they used to say a year before the election, they said, ""Well, nobody can win. Nobody, unless you win the great state of Ohio."" And we won the great state of Ohio, and we won it big. We knew we were going to win it. And now we're up a lot more than we were up even then, because you know why? We're bringing back jobs. We're bringing back factories. Everybody's working. Nobody's ever had a better year than we've been having. And we've been doing it for a long time, right? Almost from the beginning. And don't let them try and take credit, because if they came in, we would have ended up in a massive recession or worse, the D word, depression. We would have been, because they were going to put more and more and more regulations on. And I'll tell you, maybe bigger than even the tax cuts, and I did it sooner, were the regulation cuts. We freed up our nation to go back to work. True. So then we won Wisconsin, and then we won Michigan because those companies, now they're pouring back in. The auto companies are pouring back in, and Wisconsin's doing great with the farmers that Canada was taking. You know, Canada was charging our farmers 287% tariffs for dairy products. Okay? So what happens is this, we're working on healthcare. We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast. We've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the brand drugs, but they cost a tiny fraction. We've totally transformed veteran's healthcare, including getting long-sought VA choice and VA accountability, which they said could not be done. And we passed the spectacular right to try. So if you're in trouble, and I hope nobody in this massive arena's in trouble, but if you're in trouble, you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever where we have the best doctors, best hospital, best labs. You get it. And the luck we are having, we are saving so many lives. It's incredible what's happening. People would go to Europe. They'd go to Asia. If they had no money, they'd go home and die. Now they have the right to use our drugs before they're approved. Think of that. Before they're approved. And we're very importantly combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths. The overdose deaths have declined for the first time in 34 years, and life expectancy is rising again in our nation. We've launched bold new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer's disease. We're making tremendous progress, and we're pursuing new advances in neo-medical research. Think of that, neonatal research, the numbers are incredible. What's happened is incredible, to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in doing so. All of the radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth. That is why in my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total destruction of your Second Amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, the Second Amendment and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right? Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. We have tremendous energy. Tremendous energy. Everybody says to me, ""Where do you get the energy?"" Because I love what we're doing. I see the results, and they're happening faster than you even think. You see the numbers. They're happening faster than you would even think. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We are the party with big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. Right? Right? To keep our community safer and give former prisoners a second chance at life. There's been nothing like this. I passed criminal justice reform, not the Democrats. I did it with the Republicans, and this could not have been done by anybody but me and the Republican party. The Democrats did not do it. They could never have done it.  Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. We have invested $2.2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, including nearly $200 million for Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. Right? I recognized Israel as the true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. We recognize Israel sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They've been trying to get it for 52 years. And for years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. You saw that. They apologized. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Arizona. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. It is. This election is so important. It's the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020. You're the forgotten people no more. Right? No deplorables, right? No deplorables. Who knew that was going to turn out to be such a disaster? But you know, she used the worst word. What was the word she used? Irredeemables, right? I thought that was the problem. No, it was deplorable. So what the hell do I know about politics? She said, ""You're irredeemable and deplorable."" I said, ""Oh, that irredeemable's terrible."" The next day people are showing up. Women, ""I'm a deplorable."" Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp, which is vicious, horrible, ugly, and evil. Much worse than I thought. But we're getting there and not pleasant. A bunch of really bad people, very dishonest people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words and phrase. I love the phrase, Made in the USA. Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within now nine years. We started a year ago. Can you imagine that? We're doing that, and it's going to happen. Who would have thought we could have done that? We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, and you know this. You know it's under siege, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will defend it. It's under siege. It's under siege. You see it in Virginia. They want to take away the guns. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto In God We Trust. From Tucson to Tombstone, right? Do you agree? You agree, right? Look at him. He's agreeing, this guy. He's agreeing. No more censorship is right. No more evil. No more crimes. You're right. From Yuma to Mesa and from Flagstaff to right here in Phoenix, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American Patriots who poured their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our freedom. Arizona was founded by pioneers and prospectors, great prospectors, cowboys and miners and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, braved the blazing sun, and it is hot here. I've been here during the summer. I want to tell you, it's seriously hot. Of course, didn't they say that President Clinton, when he went on the back of the plane was here to play golf, it was 121 degrees that day? I don't know about that. I don't know about that. What do you think he was doing with the Attorney General? I remember he said, ""Oh, I just happened to see she was … I was here to play golf. It was 120 degrees out."" I don't know. A lot of crooked stuff went on. I wonder what they talked about. I'm sure it wasn't that she would become a Supreme Court Justice. I'm sure it wasn't that they were going to extend her tenure as Attorney General. She was a real beauty. I'm sure it wasn't. I'm sure it was nothing. They spent 45 minutes on the plane talking about golf and their grandchildren. Right? Can't let it happen, folks. Can't let it happen. We can't let it happen. You fought the battles and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are making it greater every single day than ever before. Great, great, great citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and with your drive. We are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Do you like winning? Because not very long ago you weren't winning, and I don't want you … I told this a few times during the campaign. Haven't used it in a long time, but I don't want you going to your great governor. He's a great governor, Doug Ducey. I don't want you going to your governor saying, ""Governor, governor, we just can't stand winning so much. Please go see the president in the oval office. Governor, the people of Arizona don't want to keep on winning. It's too much governor. It's not even fair to the rest of the planet. Please tell him, Governor Ducey, please tell him, ‘President, the people of Arizona have won too much. We don't want to keep on winning.'"" And I'll look at Doug Ducey, and I'll say, ""Doug, I've a lot of respect for you, Doug. You won by 16 points. That means a lot. But Doug, I don't care what you say. We're going to keep on winning, and we're going to win like never before. And the people of Arizona are going to love it."" And he's going to say, ""Thank you, Mr. President. I'm going back home."" The fact is, we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Arizona, the best is yet to come. That's right. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you, Arizona. Thank you. "
Trump,"Doesn't have the power. Doesn't have the staying power. You see what's happening in California. Blackouts, rolling blackouts. How would you like that in Pennsylvania? The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Darling, what's wrong? I can't watch Trump on television. I can't watch our president. Darling, we have a rolling blackout. It'll only be a few hours. I think we'll be on by two o'clock in the morning, darling, and we can watch a rerun. Now, this is what's happening. You have rolling blackouts. You have, in some cases, just blackouts. I don't even call them rolling. Not going to happen to your state. Last year, I visited the Shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, the largest investment in your state's history. That was all made possible by our pro energy policies. We've done it a lot. In Louisiana, we're building some of the largest plants you've ever seen, largest in the world and it's incredible, all related to energy, but your security and your jobs are in very grave peril, because the radical left maniacs, they don't want to have anything to do with energy. They don't want anything to do with, they have different concepts, right? They have the green new deal, whether it will be no energy, almost of any kind. No, it's crazy. Thought of by AOC plus three. You know AOC? and she's got them. She's radical left, but she's not as bad as some of them. How about Omar of Minnesota? We're going to win the state of Minnesota because of her, they say. He's telling us how to run our country. How did you do where you came from? How is your country doing? She's going to tell us, she's telling us how to run our country. You know what? The Democrats in Congress, you have to see what they are doing. Their stance on Israel, it's like a whole different world. It's like from 10 years ago, it's like a different world and we want to keep our world the way it was and the way it's going to be. We've got the greatest country on earth and we're going to keep it that way. We don't need socialist and we don't need communist telling us how to run our country. I do this every night and a lot of times it's a waste. I did it last night. We were … Did you see the crowd we had last night? We were in a great place, Ohio. We had a crowd. We had a crowd. You couldn't see the end of it. I said, ""Turn around camera, turn around."" But, they never liked doing that, you know? They don't like spinning those cameras. They don't want to show the crowd. They don't like showing. They don't like showing, show the crowd and this is … it's an honor. Let me tell you. Look, I used to think that was a difficulty like it was a new camera that can't turn, but then whenever there was like a problem, like there'd be a little argument or some kind of an anti-Trump person, you don't see that much. I don't want to bring it on, but you don't see it much anymore. You know why? It's dangerous. It's dangerous for them, but you know, I'd see the camera would never move, whenever where there's something like a little negative happening, that thing would turn around like a pretzel. I said, ""Oh, it does move."" But, they never want to show the crowds. They never, last night. Now, I went home and I tell you this, I go home all the time. First lady, ""How'd you like the crowd?"" Sir, I didn't see it. I didn't see it, but I didn't see it, Donald. I didn't see it. Sometimes she'll call me Mr. President, but she's only kidding. Believe me. She's only kidding. Has she been a great first lady, right? She's been a great first lady and very popular. She's really done a great job. She works hard. We have some great people here tonight. I brought certain members of my family, but I'm going to introduce them to you in a little bit, okay? Great family. They work hard. I'll tell you what, they work hard. They really work hard. But I do wish they would show because it would be, you know, it's actually better for them if they show. It shows the importance. The only thing you can do is show. I'll say, ""How did it look?"" I don't know how it looked, but the sound was phenomenal. Okay? It sounded like a Penn state football game like the Steelers football game. You can't disguise it. You ever see Sleepy Joe with the little circles? Oh, you can. He puts them very far away, so far away. Then he comes up with the mask. He's like a hundred yards from the nearest human being. He's got a … He feels good about the mask. I wonder in the debate it'll be him and I or the stage. Is he going to walk in with a mask? No, I think he'll come in with a mask. I don't know. I have no idea. Well, the question is, will he leave it on during the debate? Because it's a little hard and I'm all for mask when you need them, I'm up, but when you're making a speech and the nearest person's like where you are and you're in a stage all by yourself and then he had a habit of taking it off and it hangs down on his ear as he's speaking, it makes him feel comfortable. Honestly, whatever makes you feel good is okay with me, but it'll be interesting. I'm going to be, we're going to have a big rating on that. He's been doing it all his life. He's been doing it for 47 years and I've just started doing this stuff. I'm just starting. But, I'm just thinking, but I did it more in 47 months than he did in 47 years. That's true. That's true. You look at what we've done. No, it's true. That's actually true. He did a lot of negative stuff too. You have to deduct that out. When asked if there would be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking in a Biden administration, Joe replied, ""No, we would make sure that it's all eliminated."" All of a sudden, he gets the nomination. He's been trying to get the nomination for decades. He finally get, and that was prime time for him, which was never great. He never got more than 1%. We called it. Remember, I called him his first nickname was 1% Joe. Frankly, had Elizabeth Warren been loyal to her philosophy, which is radical left, socialism, perhaps communism. I don't know, perhaps. It's verging on communism, right? But had she been loyal, she would've left. She would have quit. She had no chance. She was out. Pocahontas. She was gone. Remember, I said, "" I have more Indian blood in me than you have and I have none."" I'd love to have some, but I don't happen to have any. Then she choked and she went out and got a test. She announced she had 1024th, right? 1,000. That means, like I said it last night, that means around 700 or 800 years ago, somewhere, there was a little bit of a relationship going and that's okay. Seven, 800 years ago, maybe. What a phony she is. It's terrible. Now, we're going to pick a great woman, any one of the five that I told you, but any one of the women that we had they're all great people, great scholars, great, brilliant people. A lot of people. 00 on Saturday at the White House. You see, we have tremendous Republican support. Two people. Always got to be two. Always got to be the two. Those two. We have great support from the Republican party, tremendous support. It's never been this unified before ever, ever and the fake impeachment. We had 196 to nothing Republican support. We had 52 and a half to a half in the Senate. Who is the half? I can't imagine. I can't. Buddy was very good today. I have to tell you, he was good. Now, I'm happy. Thank you, Mitt. Thank you. No, he was very good, very positive statement, but days ago, Biden reiterated his pledge to require net zero carbon emissions. That's basically saying, you know what that is? There'll be no more oil. There'll be no more gas. There'll be no more nothing. There'll be no more industry. There'll be no more country. That's what it's like really. That would instantly shut down all fracking and all mining immediately in Pennsylvania sending your jobs overseas, sending your money to somebody else, not you. I'll keep your jobs in Pennsylvania where they belong and you're going to be doing fracking for a long time. I can say the same because you are really big in energy. I can say the same thing to you as I say in Texas. So, they don't want oil. They don't want fracking, right? They don't want the energy that we know that powers these massive plants because the other stuff is wonderful. It's not going to do it. It's not going to do it. So, they don't like oil. They don't like the gas. They don't like God, religion, churches are close. How about these states? They still have churches closed. By the way, your governor hasn't been so great. You know that, right? Are your churches still closed? They're still closed. They're doing it for a reason. By the way, November 4th, they'll announce, ""We've decided to open up."" Okay? They're trying to make our numbers as bad as possible. So, California's closed. Pennsylvania's closed. North Carolina's closed. Michigan is closed. That's another beauty right there, Michigan's closed. Then they have these fake ballots, millions and millions of ballots. By the way, when not if, when you see shenanigans, please report it to your authorities. Okay? The real authorities, they're watching and the authorities are watching, but please report it. But when you look at it, really, it's amazing. They're trying to make our numbers look bad, but even with numerous closed states and you notice also law and order, right? Law and order, the red states, the Republican states, they're working great. Record low crime, record low, but Democrat run states, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, New York has gone through a … We have to bring back. We should draft Rudy Giuliani. Okay? Let's bring him back. Draft Rudy. We want Rudy. Rudy, Rudy. I'll tell you Rudy is amazing, but he did a great job. New York was in big trouble. He came in and he just was tough, smart, and it became the safest big city. Now, we have a man where some categories of crime were up 300%. He fired 1,000. He fired a lot of police, I guess, a billion dollars a year worth of police, worth of great police, firemen and women. It's a terrible thing. I love that place so much and it's so sad to see what's happening to New York. We're going to make a little bit of a play for New York. In theory, the Democrats automatically win New York, but I do phenomenally in most parts. Then one part, it's automatic, but I can't imagine that particular part is going to be very happy. So, we're going to make a play for New York. With Pennsylvania, I don't have to make a play. We've got Pennsylvania. Just go out of here. We don't have to make a play. We don't have to. It's a great, you know, for years though Pennsylvania was a place that Republicans just didn't win. For many years, everybody thought they were going to win, every Republican. So yeah, we're going to win Pennsylvania. They thought they were going to win it and they didn't. I came along and we won it and we won it quite easily. Quite easy. I think we're going to do even better now, because remember, number one in the history of your state last year, and that's because of what we did, we stopped the dumping. We saved your stell. So many different things, but Pennsylvania is the home of American energy. Think of it that way. This has taken place over a very short period of time. Also, the birthplace of a thing called the American constitution. Right? American constitution. To uphold our constitution as written as opposed to as conceived by some radical left judge, I will soon be announcing that nominee. You're going to love it. You're going to be so happy. If you don't love it, don't vote for me. Okay? You don't like it. My opponent refuses to release a list of justices. I was told that a big thing when I was running last time, nobody really knew me. They knew me very well. We had great success at The Apprentice and in business and it was great, but they never knew what kind of a judge I would pick or to be a justice, right? A justice of the Supreme Court. I said, ""I mean, what am I going to do? How am I going to solve that problem?"" But, I was in politics, never. Don't forget, when I ran, they said, ""No, he's inexperienced."" I ran against some very talented people. Some of whom are very good friends of mine. Some of whom I don't like too much. When I don't like somebody, it last for a long time, but I said, ""Well, how do we solve that problem?"" I don't know. They just weren't believing. The appointment of a- Just weren't believing. The appointment of a United States Supreme Court justice was much more important to the voters than I thought. And they're right, because they will set policy for 50 years and they'll set policy, whether it's life, whether it's second amendment. The second amendment, if I weren't president, you know the pressure, your second amendment would be obliterated. It would maybe be gone, but at a minimum obliterated, they haven't touched your second amendment. Not even touched it. Because I'm here to block. I'm a blocking force. I'm like a lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers. I'm a blocking force. No, they haven't touched it. But your second amendment would be under siege. So nobody knew. I never knew. You hear about Supreme Court, you know about Supreme Court, you know about other judges, by the way at the end of the first term, we'll be close to 300 federal judges, including court of appeals, which I think is a record. I guess it's a record. It's a lot. That's a lot. Nobody's done that. It's record. Think of that. 300. That's a big percentage of the entire judiciary. Think of that. 300. And many, many court of appeals judges, but two great Supreme Court judges or justices. And now we're going to get a third. Can you imagine our enemies? Three in one term. So many presidents, they just don't have the chance and it's so important. But I said to my people, I said, so if they don't believe me, what I'll do is I'll make up a list of 25 judges or people and we'll tell them, ""I will only pick from that list."" They said, ""That sounds like an interesting idea."" This was my idea. When you've never run for office before you have to have a little bit of imagination. So I got out a list, I named the people, the people are good, and I said, ""And I promise that I will pick someone like the people on this list."" And it didn't work. It went nowhere because they didn't trust it. They said, ""We want you to pick the people on the list, not somebody like the people on the list."" So I went back the next week, I said, ""I will pick somebody that's on this list."" And they were all great, great judges for the most part, I think almost entirely, but judges and really respected conservative believers in our country, solid, incredible people. And as soon as I did that, things went through the roof. It was amazing how important it was. By the way, would you stand up with that beautiful jacket? I love this guy. How many times- How many events? He's been to a couple. That's really great. Thank you very much. I've seen him before. He's been here a couple of times, like about 90. Thank you, man. That's really nice. I'm going to get one of those jackets. By the way, the wall. The wall, yeah, 330 miles. 330 miles. 330 miles. And yes, we have a great relationship with Mexico. First they said, ""He'll never be able to build it."" The Democrats were just brutal. I made a terrible mistake, I said it last night, I should have said, ""We will not under any circumstances build a wall at our Southern border."" They would have given me all the money in the world. But stupidly, I said, ""We will build a wall."" And the Democrats said, ""Let's not give it to him."" But we got it, we won. We won court cases, we won court cases. I won so much money we could build four walls if we wanted. So then they said, ""All right, all right."" They've lost. So by the way, we're up to 330, the exact wall. Their dream choice. I said to the border patrol, I love these people, they're great, ICE, the border patrol, what they do is incredible. They're incredible. I said, ""Give me your dream wall, as long as we're building we might as well build a wall that you want. Let's build it right."" ""Sir, we have to have vision. We need steel and concrete."" I said, ""How about one or the other?"" They said, ""No, sir, we need steel and concrete. We need steel. Inside those poles we have rebar and we have concrete and they're 30 feet tall. We need all sorts of things. We need them to be wired."" I won't tell you why they're wired, but they're wired for a reason. They're all wired up and they're incredible. But you know what? We got the wall. Nobody could have done it. So once we had the wall and it started going up and then we hit a hundred miles, 200 miles, now we're at 330, and we're building 10 miles a week and it'll be finished very soon. And we have the most secure border in terms of drug trafficking, trafficking coming along and we've done phenomenally well. Because that's a lot of the territory that we need. We're going to go up to probably a little bit over 500 miles, so we're at 330. But once they saw that I had it, they said, ""Yeah, but Mexico's not paying for it."" But they are paying for it, Mexico's paying for the wall. They are paying for it. They're paying at the border. They're paying for the wall. All those trucks that go back and forth. They're paying for the wall. So the Democrats said, ""Yeah, but Mexico…"", they always have to find something, right? And do you remember what I used to say that if they fight us, remember people would say, ""What happens if they fight you on the wall? What happens if they fight you right to hell on the wall?"" I said, ""The wall would get 10 feet taller."" Took a little hit on that, we took a little bit of a hit, but that's okay. The wall is a tall sucker, you don't want to get up to the top. They look down, they say, ""Oh, ye, ye, how do we get down off this?"" It's tall and it's strong and it's great. And we appreciate, because Mexico has been working with us very closely. They have right now 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border making sure that people don't come into our country. I want to thank the president of Mexico. Very helpful. So I made this list of potential justices and I'll tell you, it all changed. Now I'm asking sleepy Joe Biden to give me a list and he doesn't want to do it. You know why? Because he can only put super radical left judges on, people that would destroy our country, people that would destroy your country. And he knows that he's not electable… He shouldn't be electable anyway. This is the worst candidate. You know where he is today? They have a thing called the LID. I don't even know. Do you know what LID stands for? LID. He put out a LID today early in the morning. LID means he's not going to be anywhere today. I'm working my ass off, I'm in Ohio, I'm in Texas, I'm in Florida, I'm in Michigan, I'm in Wisconsin. Man. Thank you. That's so nice. Well, that is something that one of the fake news reporters back there, they said they've never heard of that one. ""There was a chant that's going over the last six or seven rallies saying, ‘We love you.'"" That's never happened to a politician before. Am I a politician? I don't want to be a politician. I don't think of myself as a politician. But it really is, I appreciate it. I've never heard it. I liked Ronald Reagan, but they never said we love you, or maybe they did. They're going to try and find out. Then they'll say, ""President Trump lied last night because 40 years ago I remember…"" But no, nobody's ever heard that one before and I appreciate it because it is reciprocal. Thank you very much. Reciprocal. Reciprocal love. It's reciprocal. I had such a nice life before I did this. I had such a nice life. Then I had the witch hunt that goes on forever. It goes on. And then we catch them spying on our campaign. How about that? Let's see what happens though. But we caught them spying, all of that, the whole big deal. And then the guys that were doing the investigation, they have their 31 different phones, they were accidentally wiped clean. 31 different phones, I think it was like 19 different people, and they all did the same exact accident. Which if you knew anything about phones, it's almost an impossibility to do it once. Let alone 31 different times. So we caught them and that's called obstruction. We have to remember that's called obstruction. That was the Mueller group. That was a Mueller group. All those phones, they were wiped so clean. And Hillary got a subpoena on the 30. I said, ""Forget about these things because you'll find them. They have them. They're in the state department."" I have no doubt about it, they're in the state department but they'll get them. But you know what? 33,000, they have a request from the US Congress, that's not bad, US Congress they send a subpoena, very, very important, and after getting the subpoena, she deleted all of her emails and acid washed, and then she took her telephones. I've gotten rid of phones too. I throw them away. She took cameras and she beat the hell out of them with a hammer and then threw them away. And they found a couple of them. She was very angry, obviously, if she did the hammer work. But if anyone else said this, there's a protection, there's a dual level of justice, but we're getting down to the bottom of it because it's not fair to us. Not fair to us. 33,000 emails. She deleted them on the basis that it was all about her daughter's wedding, Chelsea, and also yoga classes. 33,000 emails on yoga and a wedding. I don't think so. And Comey said, ""Oh, that's okay. That sounds like a good reason."" That's Comey. That's another beauty right there that Comey. But we caught him, we caught him. Very smart move. Getting rid of that guy was a smart move, but we caught him. Listen, we caught him. They were spying on the campaign, they were doing actually worse than that. Nobody's ever done a thing like this, so let's see what happens. But we caught him cold, we got so much stuff. Remember the insurance policy, right? From Strzok and Page, two lovers. They were very smart. They would use the public servers and send it over the public wires because they didn't want to be caught having an affair. So they went over the public. That was a very good thing for us. Wasn't it? "" Darling, darling, darling, please. She's going to win. She's going to win, isn't she? Peter, Peter only you can save us. Peter, she's going to win. Yes, darling. She's going to win. I know. 100,000 to nothing."" Remember that? It was actually 100 million to one. This was a hundred million to one. This is this idiot. So listen, ""So darling, please, please tell me again. Yes, 100 million to one she's going to win. But just in case she doesn't, we have an insurance policy."" Now that only means one thing. And we went through the insurance policy and we caught them. So let's see what happens to these treasonous crooks. These terrible people. And they put our nation through turmoil. But I just want to thank… A lot of people were very unfairly treated. You look at General Flynn, look, he's still going through it. Can you believe it? But a lot of people were unfairly treated by a bunch of treasonous, horrible people. And they used the intelligence agencies of our country to try and steal an election and to try and do a coup. Wouldn't you think? Who would ever think this country… But that's all you can say. Some people would say, ""Well, that's a conspiracy theory."" No, just take a look at the records. For me, it's a very exciting thing because we found something that nobody would have thought possible. Now let's see what happens. But we have them cold, they spied on our campaign. It's our campaign And if you want to save America, you have to go out, get out and vote. This is the most important election. In just three and a half years we've secured America's borders, which makes them very unhappy, rebuilt the awesome power of the US military, we built the military. It was totally depleted when I took over. We built a military. Two and a half trillion dollars we spent, all made in the USA, the greatest equipment, the greatest planes and rockets and missiles and our nuclear. I hate to even mention the word and hope to God we never have to use it, but we have the most powerful weapons in the history of the world. And we did that over a very short period of time. Weapons that are so powerful that we're the envy of the world, but I never want to use those weapons. And hopefully we'll never have to. You know the way you don't have to use them, is when you have them. It's when you have them. But nobody's ever built force like what we have. And the newspapers and the press and the fake news they went and said, ""He just gave away classified information!"" I said, ""No, I will look you right in the eye,"" first of all, I'm allowed to do it, I'm the president, so I'm allowed to actually. I'm the only one that's allowed to. But no, no, I didn't give away. I'm just telling you, most powerful weapons ever produced we have, and other countries know that. And it's a good thing that they know it and I don't think we'll ever be using them. And I hope we don't. I hope to God. I use the word God, because they refuse to use the word God in their pledge of allegiance, right? Twice. I use the word God. I hope to God, we never have to use them. But I obliterated the ISIS caliphate, which was all over the place. 100%. Remember I got it down to 99%. They said, ""You got to go a hundred."" I said, ""Let's get out of here. We're bringing them all back home. Everyone's coming back home."" Long, long wars. The never ending wars, the endless wars. We fixed our disastrous trade deals, they were a disaster, brought jobs and factories back to Pennsylvania under 16 years. And think of this, for 16 years presidents, Obama, President Bush, household income rose $2,945. That's over a 16 year period. In three years, your household income rose almost $10,000. When you include energy. You have to include energy. Without energy, almost $7,000. But we have to include energy. I mean, how much are you paying for your gasoline? You never saw $2 gasoline. Less, right? It's less. They go up, it's less. It's a big difference. What is it nowadays? Come on, tell me. I haven't got any gas. I haven't stopped recently at a gas station. 15? Okay. Because for a while it was way under two. And we're going to keep it there. We have so much, we have so much. In my first three years we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction in the history of our country, by far. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And right now we're doing it again. I see all these hats, Make America Great Again. And now I'm going to say this, Make America Great Again, Again. Make America Great Again, Again, Again. We saved 1.4 million jobs in Pennsylvania alone and to fight the China virus, it's the China virus, not the coronavirus. Corona sounds like a place in Italy, a beautiful place. It's corona. No, it's the China virus. They don't want to say it. The radical left, they don't want to say it. You ever notice they're always going to have to Russia. Look, nobody's been tougher on Russia than me. ""Russia, Russia, Russia."" I said, ""What about China?"" They never going to to mention it. They got little deals going on I think. But coronavirus, doesn't it sound like Italy? A beautiful villa. Corona. No, it's a China virus. They should have stopped it. To fight the China virus we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We did an A+ job, except we did a D job in terms of public relations, explaining it because we were too busy doing it. But the fact is they wouldn't have written it anyway. It didn't matter to them. It's there. It's their little thing. You have a watch Biden? He can't talk about it he thinks, so he gets up, ""The coronavirus,"" they say, ""We want to talk about Supreme Court judge today."" Well, I don't know about that. ""The coronavirus."" And he doesn't know we did a great job, he has no clue. He said, ""I should have opened."" He goes, ""I should have shut down one week earlier."" What he doesn't say is he did the worst job in the history of an epidemic or a pandemic with the swine flu. It was a joke. And what he did, his own man, that was in charge said recently, ""We had no idea what the hell we were doing. It was a total disaster."" There were amateurs. And now he tells us how to do something that's far more lethal. But he said, "" They should have closed one week early,"" except when it came to closing the border, which I did, which turned out to save tens of thousands of lives, Biden criticized me until two months later when he said I was right. But we should have closed a weak earlier. Think of that. We pioneered lifesaving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that. Remdesivir, the plasmas, we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country. Nobody knows that. And I am devastated to see it happening, but you see what's going on in Europe again. They were always saying, ""Oh, Europe is doing better."" Actually we did better, but now Europe has a big spike, a big spike. So they're not talking about that. The number of hospitalized virus patients is down by 47% and virus patients coming to the emergency room is down and visits are way down, visits to hospital. Europe has almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. They're liking to compare us to Europe. 50% greater excess mortality rate. Our early and aggressive action saved millions of lives through Operation Warp Speed. You've heard about it, they don't want to talk about it. What we've done in a record period of time with the ventilators, now we're building ventilators for the world. Very hard to do. We'll develop and distribute a vaccine very, very shortly in record time, it would have been two or three years, four years, if Biden's group had done it, but we've done a great job with the FDA in clearing a path and you'll be seeing it very shortly. And these are great companies that are doing it. So we'll crush the virus and our opponents will, with him, they will crush America. We can't let it happen. This country is too great. Our love of each other is too great. This guy doesn't know he's alive. He really doesn't. He doesn't know he's alive. He did an ad on an anonymous source that said about me making a statement about military soldiers that died. And it was such a disgusting thing. I said, ""The only good thing about it is now I can take the gloves off."" This guy doesn't have a clue. He doesn't know where the hell he is and they'll give him a shot of something. I don't know, he's going to get something. Because I watched him so badly, he performed so badly in the debates, and then with Bernie, he was average, not great, but he got through and I said, ""What the hell is he taking?"" And we'd like to ask him. And I said that, ""We want a drug test, we want a drug test. We'll both take it. We'll both take it."" Because with Bernie he was able to get through. But listen, it wasn't Winston Churchill. This wasn't the greatest, but he got through, it was fine. Him and Bernie screaming at each other, mostly Bernie. Crazy Bernie. He's not too happy. I'll tell you, did you ever see a better loser than Bernie though? Seriously. He's a good loser. He got terribly treated by Hillary and that group. And then it happened again with Elizabeth Warren, right? It happened again. What the Democrat party did to him. And then you have this guy, Mike Bloomberg, mini Mike, one question and he was gone. There goes 1.8 billion out their window. I said, ""You think it's easy up here, Mike, don't ya?"" One question and that was the end. He said, ""Where am I? Get me the hell off of this platform."" Mini Mike, mini Mike. So now he's trying to buy into the party. You would think after the way they treated him, they called him every name, Pocahontas destroyed him, she didn't do good against me, but boy did she do good against Mini Mike. I figured he'd be calling and saying, ""Listen, I want to become a Republican."" We've done great for the economy, you'd think. But he always wanted to run for president, and he tried before, I guess, but he tried and it was a bad experience. And you would think he would have joined our party. But instead he's trying to buy his way back in. When somebody treats you that way, even stay neutral, don't go back in. He wants to give them a lot of money to try and buy their friendship. And one thing you learned about politics, I spent a fraction of the money that crooked Hillary spent. They raised $2 billion. I spent my own money, but I spent a fraction of the money… I spent my own money, but I spent a fraction of the money, like 35%, 30%, and we won. Nobody ever says that. It's not about money. It's about other things. There are other things involved. It's not just about money. In the old days, my father would teach me, ""If you can win and spend less, that's a good thing."" I remember after I won and I won decisively look, 306 to 223. That's a lot. 306 delegates, 306, that's decisive. We won Michigan and we're going to win it again. We're up in a poll just now. Oh, they're going crazy. They're going crazy. We won Wisconsin. We won Pennsylvania. But my father taught me. He said, ""If you can win and spend less money, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. That's a good thing, not a bad thing."" Like if you get along with the leaders of other lands and don't go to war all the time with everybody and can come out on top without having to shed blood all over the place and destroy your families and your country, like when I get along with Putin, when I get along with Kim Jong-un. Whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with North Korea? Nothing happened. They said I gave away so much. I said, ""What did I give away?"" They couldn't find that anything. I didn't do anything. They said, ""You met."" ""Oh, I met. Oh, okay. I met."" Now you would have been in war with her. You would have been in war. But if you can spend, think of this, if you can spend less money and win, that's a good thing. So after I won one of these people back there, right back there- … in order to keep the thing going on Trump, I had won, he said, ""But Trump raised substantially less money than crooked Hillary Clinton."" That's because I didn't need the money. I didn't need the money. I can call up a lot of rich guys that raised a lot of money, but I feel uncomfortable doing it because when you do that, it's like you're sort of … It's not the same. I could call up every guy. They call me up and they say, ""Sir, how are you, sir? Mr. President, sir."" I have friends see. I don't have too many friends up because I used to be comfortable. You have to be comfortable with people, right? I have friends, I have one friend, Richard. I talk about him all the time, but multiply this times a hundred people. Richard used to call me up five, six years ago. ""Hey, let's have dinner."" ""All right. Where do you want to go?"" ""I don't know. Go to some crazy restaurant."" Today the restaurants are all closed in New York. They don't want to open them. They want to make them do badly until November but don't worry, they're opening in November 4th. But it's true. So, it's Richard on the phone, Richard, my friend for many, many years. I said, ""Hey Richard, how are you doing?"" ""Mr. President sir, how are you?"" I said, ""Well … "" He's been calling Donnie and Don and DJ, and all. ""Richard, are you okay? Everything good?"" ""Yes, sir. Mr. President, sir. You're doing a great job and I'd like to thank you."" ""Good, Richard. Richard, loosen up please. You don't have to call me Mr. Parson."" I said, ""Just call me Donald. It's okay."" ""Thank you Donald. I really appreciate it."" And you hear the guy can't breathe. He's having a hard time breathing. He's very nervous. Then at the end of the phone, he goes, ""Mr. President again, thank you so much for the job you do,"" and he hangs up. I said, how can you be friends with … ? It just doesn't work. It's like, I've lost a lot of people this way. It's called respect for the office. They have respect for the office. They really do. Nothing wrong with it. I sort of understand that. They have respect for the office. Nobody has more respect for this offices than I do. That's why I'm doing a great job, and I'll always do a great job. It's respect for the office. But on November 3rd, Pennsylvania, will decide whether we end the pandemic, defeat the virus and return to record prosperity just like we were before, or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden, who doesn't have a clue, to kill the recovery, raise your taxes, delay the vaccine. So he wants to impose a $4 trillion tax. Do you believe? 4 trillion. Ban American energy, which means what? Hey, let's go back. Let's call up the Middle East and let's be real nice to them because we need their energy. No, thank you. Destroy your suburbs. You know, I got rid of this regulation that was going to destroy your suburbs. Destroy your suburbs. I call it the Obama Regulates. They're building nice projects right next to your beautiful home. Lots of luck. Give free healthcare. I hope the people in the suburbs … When I did this, I took a lot of heat. I got rid of a regulation. They all said, ""Sir, we'll amend the regulation. We're going to amend it."" I said, ""I don't want to amend it."" A couple of stories where written. I wish the women living in the suburbs would read these stories. They were written by people that say, ""I can't believe a president had the guts to do it."" I did because I want to save the American dream. By the way, a big part of the American dream are minorities who made it and they want to live in the suburbs and they don't want to be next to a project. Remember? Sleepy Joe. He'll do it because he has no choice because they have total power. He's like a puppet for them and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies. To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and getting better every single day. We're not going to let it fail. The Democrat party has joined forces with flag burners, anarchists, anti-police people, they're extremist. Agitators. And then they say, ""Oh no, no, this was a peaceful protest. This is a peaceful protest."" They know what I'm talking about. They know our great uniform. Brilliant. We love them, but you know what? We call it a peaceful protest now, because the only thing you're allowed to do in Pennsylvania, can't go to church, right? You can't meet, you can't congregate. You can't look at each other. You can't give your wife a kiss goodnight. You've got to wear a mask. You can't do anything. They got you closed up. ""Don't go out to dinner, stay where you are."" Michigan, same thing like the governor. Her husband went boating. It was a disaster because nobody's allowed. He was the only boat. He had this massive, beautiful lake. You know the lake I'm talking about. It's a big lake. They've got to be able to do their job. You've got to let them do their job. Got to be able to do your job, right? They let you do your job, you'd see. You'd see Pennsylvania, not some big, bad crime numbers in your state. You let them do your job. Any state, New York's finest. By the way, I got endorsed by New York's finest. First time they've ever endorsed. And you know that's hard when you have radical left running the city, all politicians, the mayor. I got endorsed by the Chicago Police. Can you imagine that? I got endorsed by Oklahoma and I got endorsed by Texas and Louisiana. I got endorsed by Florida, the sheriffs. All the sheriffs got together, they endorsed Trump. I got endorsed by law enforcement, everybody. But how could you possibly endorse people that hate you and don't respect the job you do, and don't let you do your job most importantly? Because if they let you do what you do better than anybody else in the world, you wouldn't have problems. These are other police departments. You look at Seattle. We said we're going in, and they immediately said, ""We'll put up our hands."" It was so easy. We were going in the following day. You look at Portland. How about Portland? It's like an anarchist's dream. We're dealing with the governor, because you know, I hate to say it, but they're all Democrat-run cities and states. All of them, every single one. The Republicans are doing great, but they have to ask. By law, they have to ask us to go in. But do you remember that beautiful day? It was 10 days late. You had these people from CNN and other places. ""These are friendly protests."" That's a lovely thing to say. As he's getting rocks and cans of tuna fish. They go out to buy tuna fish and soup. You know that, right? Goya. I hope Goya, he's great, isn't he? Good guy. They go out and buy Goya because they throw it. They throw it. It's the perfect weight, tuna fish they can really rip it, and that hits you. No, it's true. Bumblebee brand tuna, and you can throw it at soccer, you can a curve on it. You can do whatever else you want. The cops in Chicago, you saw, they're going like this. It was terrible. They're not allowed to fight back. They're not allowed to fight back. These guys if they fight back, nobody's going to be there very long throwing things. But they're professionals, they're anarchists. They're paid for by outside stupid rich people that … They're stupid people. By the way, you know the first ones that get wiped out? They don't have a shot by the way, I'll tell you that, but if they ever did, the first ones that would get wiped out are the stupid people that gave them the money to do this stuff. Those are the people that would get wiped out. But you know, they're very smart. Everything is perfect. Do you ever see where they drop the bricks along the thing in a bag? Then they drop, everyone picks them up, throws them at our great police. We're not going to let that stuff happen, but this is all a Democrat. It doesn't happen with Republicans. I was with Greg Abbott. I was with Ron DeSantis, Texas and Florida and other governors that can't even believe a thing like that could happen, but they get caught. They're walking up. There're like 30 cans of soup. They have like 25 cans of tuna. They get caught. ""I'm bringing this home to my family. How dare you stop me?"" No, no, no. They use it as ammunition. It's terrible shame. But he went down and he didn't like it. He was hit. ""Police brutality."" You remember that? They walked in, and they've got the tear gas. They've got everything you can possibly have. Pepper spray. They don't want you to use tear gas anymore. In some places like I think in Milwaukee, they said no tear gas, no pepper spray. How the hell do you keep big crowds back? You can't. So the police all quit. They all quit. They said, ""We can't do it."" But you remember, they went out and you had one, then you had two, three, four, then you had five, six, seven. All of a sudden they started pouring in. They were getting off the buses. They came from a different locale, and then you had a line of them and there was no social distancing unfortunately. In fact, I was going to turn them in because they were right next to each other. They were right next to each other. They were touching arms and they had big, strong arms like these guys right over here. There were big strong guys. That's all right. They were like together. Then you saw the first line. Then you saw the second line, then you saw a third line, and then you saw a fourth line. Then they said, ""March."" They never halted. Just walked right through, cleaned everything up, and Minneapolis was cured. They were cured. They grabbed them. They grabbed them. They grabbed them. They were grabbing them left and right. Sometimes they grabbed, they grabbed one guy, ""I'm a reporter. I'm a reporter."" ""Get out of here."" They throw him aside like he was a little bag of popcorn. But no, but I mean, honestly, when you watch the crap that we've all had to take so long, when you see that, it's actually … You don't want to do that, but when you see it, it's actually a beautiful sight. It's a beautiful sight. Behind him was like 10 blocks of fire was … I'd never. It's a classic. I don't know. Anybody, you know what I'm talking about? Is it … So, I just have such respect, but you have to let these great professionals do what they do best. You have to let them do what they … It's called law and order. We need law and order. So, Democrat phenomena. If they win, Sleepy Joe, if they win, because he has no power over these people, these people are crazed lunatics. If they win, your cities will be like this. You'll lose all rights. Your constitution will be worthless. It'll be a terrible, terrible thing. I'm not even sure that, after some time listening to that and going along with it, I'm not even sure the country can ever recover. That's how bad it would be. I'm not sure it could ever recover. Over Labor Day. Left-wing radicals rampaged through Pittsburgh, harassing diners at restaurants. I saw that one. That was horrible. No, I saw that, right? I saw that. That one guy grabs a woman, a older woman, she's eating a steak. He grabbed the steak and started eating it, then he threw it back on the plate. An outdoor place, and her husband standing there like they're afraid for their lives. It was a terrible thing, and should never be allowed to happen. A thing like that should just be closed up before it ever gets started. That was terrible. Remember that? An older woman. Last week after a police officer shot a knife-wielding assailant, over 100 rioters rampaged in Lancaster. Went to school right nearby. Looting businesses, setting fires and assaulting police offices with rocks and bricks and glass. You saw that. Joe Biden has the support of violent left wing extremists. He never once mentioned the words law and order during their entire Democrat National Convention. Never once. They didn't talk about the riots, they didn't talk about anything having to do with law and order and respect and our great police. They didn't do it. They didn't talk about it. It's not a subject. They will rip your cities apart and they will go to your suburbs for all of those people in the suburbs that are ready to go about, they will go to your suburbs next. I have the support of America's law enforcement heroes. I was recently honored to be endorsed by the largest group of police and police representatives in the country. We're endorsed by everybody. We're joined by Butler County Mike Slupe. Thank you, Mike, as well as two sheriffs who just changed their registrations, oh that's nice, to become Republicans. They were long time Democrats. Who are those two showers? Wow. Thank you. It's Fayette County Sheriff James Custer and Forest County Sheriff, Bob Wolfgang. Where's Bob? Stand up, fellows. Thank you. Were you long time Democrats? How the hell did that happen? Well, this is somewhat of a phenomena. This is somewhat … This is crazy what's going on now. It can be stopped so easily, and you guys know exactly what I'm talking about. Thank you very much. It's an honor to have you in the party. Thank you. That's great. There's a whole great group of sheriffs and law enforcement here. Also, with us, our Congressman Guy Russian Reschenthaler. Guy. Where's Guy? Great warrior. Where are they sitting? And a friend of mine and a warrior. He's a warrior. He's tough as hell. They said, ""We want to impeach the president for making a perfect phone call."" Oh, did you hear today? They want to impeach me again. They said, if I submit the name of one of the most talented people in the world to be a justice of the Supreme Court, they want to impeach me. They want to impeach me if I'm following the constitution. No, think of it. This is crazy Nancy. These people are stonecold crazy. Think of it. I got impeached for making a perfect phone call. Perfect phone call. Everybody read it. Nobody to this day … and the Republicans stuck together. It was great. Also, a friend of mine and he wanted to just rip them apart, I remember when he heard about it. He's a rough guy and he's a popular guy too. They love him. Congressman Mike Kelly. Thank you, Mike. Come on up here. Come on up here. Just come up. Come on up. Mike, come up. Come on. Guy, come up. Congressmen Glenn Thompson, Congressman Dan Muser, come on. And Congressman Scott Perry. Thank you, Mike. Hey Mike, good shape. Come on, get up there. Oh what a group. What a group. Thank you. He's the real deal. Conor lamb is just a puppet for Nancy Pelosi and crying Chuck Schumer. You know crying Chuck? He cries every time he thinks it's appropriate. Now, I'll tell you what. This Conor lamb turned out to be a stonecold phony. When he was running … It's a very Trump … they like me. I thought he was a Republican because his ads were so good. ""We have to respect our president. We have … "" I said, ""This guy's doing some beautiful ads,"" and then I found out he was a Democrat. I'll tell you what. He's nothing compared to Sean. Sean is the real deal. Thank you so much. Just give a little hand, because he's done a hell of a job too. Our campaign chair, Bernie Comfort. Thank you, Bernie. Bernie Comfort. Thank you. Thank you to Bernie Comfort. Thanks, Bern. All right. While you guys are standing behind me like a beautiful curtain there … Well they're not blocking Air Force One so we could … But I have a woman with us tonight who has devoted so much. She gave up her business. She said, ""Dad, I'm going to come to Washington and help you. I love you daddy, and we're going to help people. I don't care and … "" She was very successful in every way, and it's my daughter Ivanka. I just want to thank this group of people. And a man that helped, we just negotiated a major peace deal in the Middle East. Everyone said it was impossible. You know that, right? They said it's impossible. They've been killing everybody for years and years, they had this guy, John Kerry, who's grossly incompetent. They paid $150 billion to Iran, they paid 1.8 billion in cash. That's even more impressive, frankly, in cash, that's John Kerry. And we just made a deal with Bahrain and UAE, United Arab Emirates, and Israel, and it's a great thing. And the man right there, Jared, the abuse, the abuse he takes, but he did something that nobody's been able to do, and he wants none of the glory, he'd rather not come up here. These guys will come up 100%. Jared, great deal, great job. Incredible. Everyone's talking about it. We have plenty of other countries going to join and there's no blood in the sand. Okay. Thanks honey. Thank you. Great people. Thank you, Sean. Thank you, Sean. We have spent the last four years reversing the damage that Joe Biden inflicted over the last 40. They like Sean. Sean, will you please win? Sean Parnell. I'll tell you, he's popular. That's great, Sean. We love Sean. But Biden championed every globalist portrayal of Pennsylvania for half a century, he was a cheerleader for the worst trade deal ever made by any country, NAFTA and China's entry into the world trade organization, which built China like a rocket ship. They were flat lined for many, many decades and then right through the roof, that was a Biden approval. These disasters ripped out one third of your state's manufacturing jobs. You know what happened. Biden shouldn't be asking for your vote, he should be begging for your forgiveness. He did a terrible job. Now the Democrat party is pledging to rejoin the disastrous Paris Climate Accord. You want to spend a lot of money for nothing? Eviscerating your state's economy, you will spend a trillion dollars and what it is really, it takes away your power, it takes away your energy. You'll be closing your plants and factories all over the place. I withdrew from it. And you know what, the people that understand, the smart people, they said, ""I can't believe you had the guts to do it."" And I figured I was going to be absolutely killed on this one. And you know what, I'm so proud I did it and people get it. It was a rip off of the United States. I withdrew from the catastrophe because I was elected to fight for Pittsburgh, not for Paris. This election is a choice between Pennsylvania and China, if Biden wins, China wins. When we win, Pennsylvania wins and America wins. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars that never ended and defending foreign borders. But now we're finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops, back home in the USA where they belong. All coming home. During the pandemic, I've suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened American jobs. As our economy reopens, I want to ensure that Americans are first in line to get the great jobs and the high wages. America first. Biden wants to flood the economy with cheap labor to replace US workers. You know that. And that's why never, never, I see his say, hire American. He got it for me, all the words he's got there, are my words, right? Do you ever see it? They say he copied my campaign. I keep saying, what the hell happened for 47 years and now he's copying my campaign. As president … and you know it's not going to happen with him, as president, I know my first duty is always to take care of you, the American worker. That's what we're taking care of. Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in US history and we are finishing that wall, it's going to be done so fast. It's got to be done so fast. Since 2017 ICE has successfully arrested nearly a half a million illegal aliens with criminal records, including over 145,000 assaults, 40,000 sex offenses and 5,000 murderers. If you don't mind, Democrats will bring them the hell out of our country, we'll get them out of here. Some of them are so violent, we have to keep them. We don't want to house them for 50 years, but if we let them go, they come back in, as much as we watch. If they come back in, we don't want it, we don't want them. So we keep them here, we have no choice. If the left gains power, they will abolish … Republicans will always … they're going to abolish. Republicans will always stand with these incredible heroes of ICE and border patrol. You have to see these ICE people. They go into a den of MS13, and they call them a den, a nest, where you have these guys that are vicious, vicious gang members. And they go in there, they just start swinging. It's the craziest thing, they love it. Now, who wants that job? Do you want that job? Look, he's a tough guy sitting here, you too, you're tough guys, you don't want any part of it. They're just incredible and they love our country. They love our country. And then people say, "" Oh, they're too rough. They're too rough."" You have no idea how bad some of these gangs are and what they do. They use knives because it's more painful. They cut people up. They cut two young, beautiful girls, 16 years old. They were going home from school and they cut them to pieces, killed them, they're animals. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US armed forces in 75 years, space force. Not since the air force. Think of it, the air force was last. If I did just that, space force big deal, by the way, it's going to end up being one of the most important things you've ever imagined. But if I just did that, a sixth branch of the US military, that would be a big deal. That's like one of many, many things. We passed VA choice and VA accountability. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, they were after him for a year. We took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and many others. Qasem Soleimani is gone. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal, one of the great disasters. And by the way, it's practically expired. The crazy deal that Obama made practically expired. And his chief negotiator, he never left. "" I want this."" ""Nope. We're not giving to you."" ""Okay, let's go on to the next one. Give me this."" ""Nope."" ""Give me this."" ""Nope."" ""Give me this."" ""Nope."" He never won a point, he lost everything. It's the worst deal I've ever seen. And the only time he left the table is to go on a bicycle ride and he crashed and broke his leg and his arm. And I promised everybody I would never go riding in a bicycle race. I swear to you. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. That was a 52 year development that I got done in about a day. They'd been negotiating that sovereignty over the Golan Heights, I got it done immediately. 52 years, they worked on that. But instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East. It's so great. Peace in the Middle East. So Biden's put forward a platform that would end America as we know it. And this is true. I don't think of him as a radical lefty, but basically he's controlled by them. And what about this Kamala? How about her? She at 15%, no, she's at 13%. Then people started … no she's at 12. No, she's at 10. She's at nine, she's at seven. These are a poll numbers. She got worse than worse. She quit before she ever got to Iowa. We have a great vice president, Mike Pence. He's great and he says hello. If elected, Biden would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions, people with preexisting conditions, drain your Medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants. They're all going to come in. If you have that, the problem is we're going to give you healthcare, they're going to all pour into the United States and our country can't afford it. We want to be nice, we all have hearts, country can't afford it. They would get people that never even thought of coming if they see that. Can't do it. They would end our travel bans on jihadist regions. We have very strong … remember I got travel bans. Everyone thought it was such a terrible thing, such a terrible person. He's such a terrible person. I'm such a bad guy, I got travel bans. And increase refugee admissions by more than 700%, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. Ban school choice and all charter schools, they're very important. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. All Americans, race, color, creed, all Americans. So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China, once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, right here in Pennsylvania. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We'd ban them. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. Thank you. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless, ridiculous, stupid foreign wars. We losing our youth to countries that you'd never even heard of, right? Never even heard of them. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will surprise, think of the surprise medical billing, we're going to end it, surprise. You ever walk into a hospital, oh, gee, fix you up. Oh, great. Then you get a bill for $2,000 for a band-aid. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which I've already signed and brilliantly starts on January 1st. Hey, you better vote for me. You know, I think that's, in a way, bigger than healthcare. Can you imagine Biden if he won? Price transparency is so big, it's all done, it starts on January 1st. How smart is that? How smart. And you're going to see numbers and reductions like you've never seen. Could you imagine if he were president, ""Sir, our medical costs have dropped in half price. Transparency has been unbelievable."" ""What is that? What is price transparency?"" And they'll explain it to him. He still won't have a clue. But can you imagine giving him credit? I signed it, it's all done. It starts on January 1st. I say, ""Why can't you start it now, just in case?"" And know what they said, ""Sir, statutorily, it has to start then."" I said, ""All right, let's go."" But I know we're going to win, so it's not going to matter. And we're going to further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We have a favored nations laws, well now we get the same price as all these nations that are paying a tiny fraction, which should have been instituted a long time ago. And the drug companies are going after me with those ads. Oh, it's terrible, terrible. You know why? Just every time you see an add from the drug company, they got plenty of money, that's why nobody ever fights them. Anytime you see an ad from a drug company, just remember one thing, your drug prices are coming down. That's what it means. That's what it means. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security and we will always protect patients. We will protect every single patient. America will land, by the way, the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. You know, NASA was an absolute disaster, grass was growing through the fairways too. They had fairways, that's about all they use, were the fairways. And now we have something, right through the runways, the landing strips, it was all grass infested, it was all weed infested, and now it's the number one space center in the world, by far. It was a closed up mess. And we have rich guys sending up rockets, Elon and others. They send up rockets and we say, let them keep going. Let them keep spending money on these rockets. They love rockets. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words in our national motto, in God, we trust. For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Pennsylvania, like nobody has ever stood up before. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and your coworkers, and get out and vote And early voting, if you didn't know it, has already begun and watch it and watch those fake ballots, you got to go out and turn them in. If you see somebody cheating, you got to turn them in, from Erie … and you probably will, it's going to be a mess, watch this. But get out and vote early. From Erie to Eastern, from Altoona to Scranton, from Harrisburg to right here in Pittsburgh. Say hello to big Ben. We stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for their beloved country. This is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence, right? This is the state. Such history, such history. It's where the army, weathered it's brutal winter at Valley Forge, I know it well. Where George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware and where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg. Gettysburg, one of the great, great, incredible sights of history, Gettysburg. So vicious, so horrible and yet so beautiful and so historic, right? Incredible. Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mine the coal, work the railroads, forge the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater, greater, greater than ever before. Not even close, not even close, it's what we're doing, we're doing it together. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you."
Trump,"Hello, Houston. I am so thrilled to be here in the great state of Texas with one of America's greatest, most devoted and most loyal friends, Prime Minister Modi of India. Thank you. Thank you. And Prime Minister Modi is doing a truly exceptional job for India and for all of the Indian people. It is my immense privilege to be here with him today at this profoundly historic event. We're especially grateful to be joined by over 50,000 incredible members of our nation's thriving, prospering, flourishing, and hardworking Indian American community. Thank you. Just a few months ago in the largest democratic election in the history of our world, 600 million Indians went to the polls and voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Modi and his party. Congratulations, Mr. Prime Minister. That's a lot of people. Earlier this week, I understand you marked another important milestone. I know everyone here joins me in wishing you a very happy birthday. Happy birthday. I want to take a moment to address every resident of Houston effected by the recent horrible flooding. The entire American nation is standing by your side. We're ready. We love you. We support you. We will be there with you every single step of the way. I just left the Coast Guard hanger at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base where I was briefed on the Texas flooding. We're working with your great governor Greg Abbott, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, Attorney General Ken Paxton and senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Thank you very much. We're working hard together. My administration will not rest until you have fully recovered, restored, and rebuilt and I know you will come back with the same tremendous spirit that we have shown every single time, every time there's been a problem. It's called ""Houston strong."" Prime Minister Modi and I have come to Houston to celebrate everything that unites America and India, our shared dreams and bright futures. I've also come to express my profound gratitude to the nearly 4 million amazing Indian Americans all across our country. You enrich our culture, you uphold our values, you uplift our communities and you are truly proud to be American and we are proud to have you as Americans. We thank you, we love you and I want you to know my administration is fighting for you each and every day. I want to recognize US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster and Minister Jaishankar of India. Thank you very much. Thank you both. Thank you very much. Thank you. We're also proudly joined by NASA Deputy Administrator Jim Morhard, Deputy Secretary Of Energy Dan Brouillette, Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky, your state attorney general, Ken Paxton, a couple of very great senators. Kevin, thank you. Thank you all for being here. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you. We have a lot of senators. We have a lot of Congress people. There's Mr. Brady, Congressman Brady. He gave us a very, very nice tax cut folks. Thank you, Kevin, very much. Thank you all for being here. Among the leaders here today for this remarkable celebration are many members of the House and Senate. They're all over the audience, including House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, and again, senators Cornyn, Cruz. In my campaign for president, I promised all of that. If we were elected, India would have a true and great friend in the White House and I can tell you, you have never had a better friend as president that President Donald Trump. That I can tell you. The prime minister knows that. On this day, I'm happy to report that the relationship between the United States and India is stronger than ever before. The ties between our two nations are grounded in our common values and our shared commitment to democracy. We are free nations with great faith and a fierce devotion to our national independence. We are governed by the rule of law, guided by commitment to justice, and strengthened by our love of liberty. Our two national constitutions both begin with the same three beautiful words, ""We the People."" That means that in America AMD India alike, we honor, respect, trust, empower and fight for the citizens we proudly serve. Under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, the world is witnessing a strong sovereign and thriving Republic of India. In a single decade, with the help of Prime Minister Modi's pro-growth reforms, India has lifted nearly 300 million people out of poverty and that is an incredible number. Incredible. That's incredible. In the next decade, 140 million Indian households will rise to the middle class. In both India and the United States, we're seeing something really remarkable. Our people are prospering like never before because we are slashing bureaucracy and cutting job killing red tape. In the United States, thanks to our massive tax cuts and all of our great senators and congressmen and women that are here today and pro worker policies, our economy is breaking one record after another. Since my election, we have created over 6 million new jobs. We have created over 750,000 jobs right here in Texas and very importantly, that includes 70,000 new Texas manufacturing jobs. They said that couldn't be done. Unemployment … Think of this. Unemployment in Texas is currently at the lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country, and unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years and very soon we think that will be broken to be a historic number. Unemployment among African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans have all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country. Over the last two years, the unemployment rate among Indian Americans dropped by nearly 33 and one third percent. Wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and inequality is falling at the fastest rate in many, many years. In the past 12 months alone, the average worker has taken home $1,000 extra in rising wages and over $3,000 with tax cuts and all of the other things that we've done. And for the first time in history, most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women. First time that's ever happened. Through our pledge to America's workers, we have secured commitments for nearly 14 million employment and training opportunities for American workers done through our great American companies. We passed the biggest tax cuts and the biggest tax reforms in the history of our country. We slashed a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household more than $3,000 every year and never in the history of our country, no matter how long the presidency, have regulations been cut to this extent. Everyday, the Indian American community is helping to strengthen our country and build our future. Indian Americans are pioneering groundbreaking medicines to save countless lives. They're developing revolutionary technology that is changing the world and they're founding new businesses that provide jobs to thousands of our fellow citizens. Prime Minister Modi, I look forward to working with you to make our nations even more prosperous than ever before. And that's what's happening. The economic miracles taking place today are just beginning. Here in the United States, there has never been a better time to hire, invest, grow, and pursue your dreams. Indian companies employ tens of thousands of Americans across a range of industries, including American steel. In 2018 India's JSW Steel announced that it would invest up to $500 million to revitalize a shuttered steel plant in the great state of Ohio. And we welcome India's growing investments right here in the Lone Star State. Nations around the world are investing in the United States because they know we have the best economy and the best workers in the world. They have never invested in our country like they are today. And we want to thank everybody and India has never invested in the United States like it is doing today. And I want to say it's reciprocal because we're doing the same thing in India. On Tuesday, two Japanese companies, Toyota and Aisin, announced a combined investment of almost $800 million, which will create over 900 new jobs right here in Texas. At the same time, we are working to expand American exports to India, one of the world's fastest growing markets. We are committed to ensuring the Indian people have access to the finest goods in the world, product stamped with a beautiful phrase, ""Made in the USA."" And very soon, India will have access to another world class American product, NBA basketball. Wow, sounds good. That sounds good. Next week thousands of people will gather in Mumbai to watch the first ever NBA basketball game in India. Am I invited, Mr. Prime Minister? I may come. Be careful. I may come. When it comes to expanding our commercial relationship, no issue is more important than energy security. For the first time ever, the United States is the number one producer of both oil and natural gas on planet earth and number one by far, with much of it coming right here from the great state of Texas. That means more jobs, higher wages, and lower prices at the pump. Yesterday, we were thrilled to hear about the Indian company Petronas pledge to purchase up to 5 million tons of LNG per year from the United States, which could lead to billions of dollars of LNG exports to India in the coming years. And we have plenty of it. Over the last year, crude exports to India have grown by 400% and liquefied natural gas exports continue to soar at record numbers. Thank you. These tremendous exports not only expand employment in America, but they increase freedom and security for India. To keep our nation safe, the United States and India forging an even stronger security partnership. US defense sales to India have also reached $18 billion over the past decade. We make the greatest defense mechanisms and equipment anywhere in the world and India knows that well. We're looking forward to concluding several new defense deals very soon. There are a lot of them in the works. Here in America, we're creating the United States Space Force and we're working closely with India to enhance space cooperation. In November, the United States and India will demonstrate a dramatic progress of our defense relationship, holding the first ever tri-service military exercise between our nations. It's called Tiger Triumph. Good name, it's a good name. Very good name. Today, we honor all of the brave American and Indian military service members who work together to safeguard our freedom. We stand proudly in defense of liberty and we are committed to protecting innocent civilians from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Thank you. Both India and the United States also understand that to keep our communities safe, we must protect our borders. Since taking office, my administration has launched a far-reaching effort to improve screening and vetting of applications for entry. We are working hard to ensure that those who would threaten our security are denied admission into our country and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like- … country, and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like never before, not even close. We're doing it on a daily basis, and we'll soon be setting records in every one of the aspects of border security. Border security is vital to the United States. Border security is vital to India. We understand that. We are further taking unprecedented action to finally secure our southern border and stop illegal immigration. I want to thank the president of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. It's been incredible what's taken place in a short period of time. Illegal immigration is deeply unfair to millions of wonderful legal immigrants who work hard, pay their taxes, follow our rules, and obey our laws. Yet there are those in Washington who would raid your healthcare to … Free benefits. They want to fund free benefits to those who enter our country illegally. We don't want to do that. We don't want to do that. Because if we don't do it, they won't come. I will never allow politicians to take away your healthcare or give it to illegal immigrants. My administration believes our first duty is to the highest loyalty of all. We must always be for the American people, whether it's African-American, Hispanic-American, Indian-American. We are going to take care of our citizens first. We are going to take care of our Indian-American citizens before we take care of illegal immigrants that want to pour into our country. We want to build a nation where every family, immigrant and US-born, can live in a safe community with access to great school, work in a job you love, and have the best chance to reach the American dream. We love the American dream. Just in concluding, I want to say that America has always been a nation of pioneers and patriots, risk-takers and free thinkers, and dedicated workers who have honed a trade, mastered their field, and teach their children to always give their very, very best. Every day Indian-Americans help write the story of American greatness, and everyone here today has a crucial part to play in building an even grander and greater American and Indian future. To help achieve that exciting vision, we are strengthening our cherished bonds with the nation of India, and we are proving the awesome power of democracy and unlimited potential of free people. Together, we will continue to deepen the ties between our nations. We will honor the faith of dignity of our citizens, and we will achieve incredible advancements for our people, for our children, and for the world. We will discover new cures and save millions of lives. We will advance cutting-edge technologies and lift millions and millions of people out of poverty. We will pioneer new frontiers in space, working together, raising the sights of humanity. We will uphold our values, defend our liberty, and control our destiny. The United States and India will make our nations stronger, our people wealthier, our dreamers bigger, and our future brighter than ever before, and it won't even be close. I want to thank everybody for being here. I want to especially thank a great man and a great leader, the leader of India, Prime Minister Modi, my friend. Thank you. God bless you all. God bless India, and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you. Now I would like to invite onto this stage in front of this incredible group of unbelievable people Prime Minister Modi, who's going to give us some of his wisdom. His wisdom is indeed great. Thank you all very much. It's been a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you."
Trump,"Well, thank you very much. Vice President Mike Pence, great job you're doing. And hello Toledo! We love Toledo. You remember, I was here a lot. You remember 2016, what a year that was, right? And 2020 is going to be even better, no doubt. But I'm thrilled to hold the first rally of 2020 right here in the great state of Ohio. And as we begin the new year, our economy is booming, wages are soaring, workers are thriving, and America's future has never, ever looked brighter, ever. We're the envy of every country in the world. We've created seven million brand new jobs since our election. And we will soon be replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the incredible brand new USMCA, the historic victory for Ohio farmers, workers, and manufacturers, but really a great victory for the United States. It's an incredible agreement. You remember I came and I'd always talk about how bad our trade deals are. We did a brand new one with Korea. So now we have South Korea, we just finished a big one, $40 billion with Japan. On January 15, we're signing a monster, a big beautiful monster, $40 to $50 billion to our farmers. Our farmers will be taking in, I keep saying go buy larger tractors. Go buy larger tractors. I said there's no way, I don't know if you know this story, my people wanted 20 billion to purchase, right? 20 billion, 20, that's a lot money, that's a lot of corn, $20 billion, and I said, ""Make it 50. China's very big."" And they said, ""Okay."" They said, ""Sir, the farmers can't produce that much."" I said, ""Let the farmers tell me that. Tell them to go out and, remember, and buy a bigger what? Tractor, buy a bigger tractor."" You'll produce it. So $40 to $50 billion of agriculture product and the manufacturers and the car companies, and we brought a lot of car companies into Ohio, you know that. A lot of them are coming in. A lot of them have already been brought in. They're coming in from Japan, they're coming in from all over the world. This is where they want to be. They want to be in the United States. This is where the action is. They're all coming back. I used to go around and talk about how everyone's leaving. They were all leaving. A lot of you were victims of that leaving. These companies would leave, they'd go to Mexico, they'd go to Canada, they'd close up, they'd buy from China. Now they're all coming back, new ones, old ones, they're all coming back, and many are coming right here to Ohio. And just in case you didn't know it, Ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state. That's not bad, that's not bad. And this year's going to be even better and maybe much better. But weeks ago, I signed the largest ever investment in the United States military, $ 738 billion, and we created the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force, and everybody's excited about that. After years and years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the United States military. Some of it's still coming in. We have everything. We've got new planes, we've got new rockets, new missiles, we've got new everything, and it's either here or coming in, $2.5 trillion in new investments. So our military is now stronger and more powerful than ever before. And if you remember, three years ago when I took over, we were depleted. Our military was totally depleted. And by the way, speaking of our military, have we taken care of our vets with Choice, with Choice. That was a big thing. You know, I used to go around and the VA was a terrible situation. People would wait weeks. He's right, he said, ""Yes, it was."" You don't hear too much about that anymore, have you noticed? Choice and accountability, you know what accountability is? For 44 years, they tried to get accountability. That's somebody bad, works for the VA, you couldn't fire them. You couldn't fire them. They could be sadistic, they could be thieves, they could be whatever they were, you couldn't get rid of them. We got accountability approved, and now we say, ""You're fired, get out."" We get somebody that's good. 44 years, and maybe most importantly of all is Choice, VA, Veterans Choice. So you now wait in line, and a lot of times you'd wait in line for four or five, six weeks you couldn't see a doctor. Now you don't have to wait. You go out to a private doctor, you get yourself taken care of, we pay the bill. What a difference it's made. What a difference it's made. You know, when I was a little bit newer to this game– That's okay, they got it, they got it. They go home to mommy. Go on home to mommy. Go on home to mommy. It's a beautiful sight. Thank you, security. Do we love law enforcement, by the way? So with the VA, I used to go around saying, ""Why don't they do that? Why don't these people, why don't they go to a private doctor and work something out?"" And I thought it was a brilliant plan. I said, ""I'm telling you I am such a smart guy."" I said, ""This is the most brilliant thing ever."" And I went back to my people and I said, ""I have an idea. A veteran's sick, they can't get the kind of service they need, they need a certain kind of doctor, I have an idea, such a great idea. You get to go out, private, you're going to pick out a doctor, you're going to get yourself fixed up. We're going to pay the bill, right?"" And you know what happened? And I said, ""How brilliant is that?"" They said, ""Sir, we've been working on that for 48 years, but we've never been able to get it approved."" So I was very, very disillusioned, but you know what I'm good at? Getting things approved. And we got it approved. So we signed that 11 months ago, and what a difference that's made in terms of your lines and in terms of people's health. People would wait online for weeks, and some people weren't very sick and they'd end up being terminally ill. They couldn't get to see the doctor. Now they go out, they get a doctor, we take care of them. We can take care of our vets. So we're using this great power not to pursue conflict, but to really preserve, and I mean in the true sense of the word, preserve peace. We have this tremendous military, and you know what that is? That's really a great fighting force, but I hope we never have to use it. I really do. You saw an example of that a couple of days ago. So we seek friends, not enemies, but if you dare to threaten our citizens, you do so at your own grave peril. We've never had a military, what we have now, we've never had anything like it. We were looking at planes that were old and tired, 50, 60-year-old planes. You've heard the story, the grandfather flew them, the son flew them, the current wonderful person flew them, the whole family flew them. Those are all gone now, folks. Those are all gone. In October of last year, US Special Operations Forces executed a daring nighttime raid that killed the bloodthirsty founder and leader of ISIS. The animal known as al- Baghdadi is dead. And the entire ISIS caliphate is destroyed, and his terrorist empire, and he was indeed a monster, has been totally demolished. We killed thousands and thousands of ISIS warriors, fighters, and we have thousands of them right now locked up where they should be. Nobody has ever done what we've done in three years. And I'll say this, when we took it over, it was a mess. We did it in a short period of time, but when we took it over, it was not good. And last week, the United States once again took the bold and decisive action to save American lives and deliver American justice. And you know what I'm talking about. For years, the sadistic mass murderer, Qasam Soleimani, planned and executed attacks against American targets, killing and wounding thousands of US service members and many, many thousands, and even hundreds of thousands, of other people. As the leader of Iran's terrorist Quds Force, Soleimani spread death, destruction, and mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond. He ordered the violent assault on the American embassy in Baghdad. And you saw this was the anti-Benghazi. We got there very quickly. We got there very quickly. This is the exact opposite, we did it exactly the opposite of Benghazi, where they got there so late, all they saw when they got there days later were burning embers from the days before. That's all they saw. We got there very early. We saw what was happening. I saw what was happening, and I said, ""What's that all about?"" And that was going to be another Benghazi. Had they broken through the final panels of glass, they were breaking and breaking it, had they gotten through, we would have had either hundreds of dead people or hundreds of hostages. That wasn't going to happen. And I called up our great generals, and I said, ""Get them over there now."" And one of our leaders, one of our really admired people, said, ""Sir, we'll have them there tomorrow."" I said, ""Nope, get in the planes right now, have them there immediately,"" and they got there immediately, fortunately. But he directed the recent rocket strikes that wounded four American service members, badly wounded, and killed an American citizen. That was just before we happened to hit him. Soleimani was actively planning new attacks and he was looking very seriously at our embassies, and not just the embassy in Baghdad. But we stopped him, we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold. So at my direction, the United States military eliminated Qasam Soleimani and ended his rampage through not only that part of the world, but much bigger parts of the world, he was all over. He was a bad guy, he was a bloodthirsty terror and he's no longer a terror, he's dead. And yet now I see the radical left Democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist. And you know, instead they should be outraged by Soleimani's savage crimes and the fact that his countless victims were denied justice for so long. He was the king of the roadside bomb. You know of the roadside bomb, and then they got bigger, and he'd send them over to Afghanistan and Iraq. And when you see our friends and our great wounded warriors and our great warriors, when you see them without their legs and without arms and with so much damage, it's most likely that he caused that damage, because that's what he liked. He loved planting the roadside bomb. So now he's gone, and that's a good thing. Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, has condemned the US military strike on Soleimani, the world's top terrorist, think of it, the world's top terrorist, and we're having people like Nancy Pelosi, that's a real genius, do you believe that one? Nancy, nervous Nancy. But here's a guy who slaughtered and butchered civilians all over and military, whoever was in his way, and we have Bernie and Nancy Pelosi, we have them all, they're all trying to say, ""How dare you take him out that way? You should get permission from Congress. You should come in and tell us what you want to do. You should come in and tell us so that we can call up the fake news that's back there and we can leak it."" That's a lot of corruption back there, folks. No, but think, seriously, so they want me… So these are split-second decisions. You have to make a decision. So they don't want me to make that decision. They want me to call up, maybe go over there, let me go over to Congress, or come on over to the White House, let's talk about it. When can you make it? Well, I won't be able to make it today, sir, so how about say in a couple of days? Oh, good, come on over. No, we got a call, we heard where he was, we knew the way he was getting there, and we had to make a decision. We didn't have time to call up Nancy, who is not operating with a full deck. No, they want us to call, can you imagine calling crooked Adam Schiff? He's so crooked, he's so crooked. Shifty Schiff and say, ""Gee, Adam, how are you doing? Listen, we have the world's number one terrorist, killed thousands and thousands of people. We'd like to set up a meeting so we can discuss his execution. Would you be willing to meet?"" ""Well, I won't be able to make it this week."" ""Well, you know, he's traveling fast. We got him lined up, Adam, you little pencil-neck."" Nine inches. He buys the smallest shirt collar you can get, and it's loose. Now come on, Adam, we got to meet faster on it. We got to take this guy out. We're not going to have another shot at him maybe ever again. ""But I can't make it now because I'm trying to impeach Trump, I'm trying to impeach, even though he did nothing wrong."" By the way, did you see, I did nothing wrong. They don't even know what in the hell is going on. In fact, it's so weak, she doesn't want to put in the articles, it's so weak. They're so pathetic. They're so pathetic. So they want us to call them. Now, Schiff is a big leaker. He leaks to crazy CNN. See with the little red light on over there. Not too many people are watching CNN. But he leaks. So he'll say, ""You know, off the record, I got to hurry up because everyone's watching me in the hallway on my cell phone, off the record they've got the number one terrorist in the world, Soleimani, and they're going to get him, they're going to take him out in the next 10 minutes. Please, don't tell anybody I told you."" So we have breaking news, President Trump within the next 20, 25 minutes, looks to be taking out terrorist General Soleimani. He's going to do it. It should be happening in about the next 20 minutes, 19, 18, 17."" Then we get back to the battlefield, how'd you do, fellas? ""I don't know, sir, he disappeared. I don't know what happened to him."" They want us to tell them so that they can leak it to their friends in the corrupt media. You got to say though, that's a lot of media, right? That's the way the Academy Awards used to look when it was successful. Then they started hitting us all the time and it became unsuccessful. I love it, I love it, actually. Oh, they have some bad ones here tonight. They have some really bad ones, some really sick ones. They have one good one, by the way, one good one. They have one good one, a bunch of bad ones. Very, very dishonest people and we have some great ones, too. We have some great journalists, great reporters. But you've got a tremendous amount of dishonest media people like I have never seen in my life before. They write things that they know are wrong. They write, if you watched for the last three years, think of it, and then they get Pulitzer Prizes, but it turned out to be all wrong. How do you do that? They get Pulitzer Prizes for being wrong. The Pulitzer Prize doesn't mean a thing. It doesn't mean a thing. I mean, I'm here to tell you about the Nobel Peace Prize. I'll tell you about that. I made a deal. I saved a country. And I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Noble Peace Prize for saving the country. I said, ""Did I have something to do with it?"" Yeah, but you know, that's the way it is. As long as we know, that's all that matters. I saved a big war. I saved a couple of them. But under my administration, we will never make excuses for America's enemies, we will never hesitate in defending American lives, and we will never stop working to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, never. And nobody's done it like we've done it. And it's we, it's we. It's not me, it's we. It's a whole movement. There has, by the way, never been a movement like this. You know, outside, I don't know what this place holds, it's like 10, 11,000 people, right? Outside you have thousands and thousands of people that want to get in. There's never been a movement like this. There's never been a movement like this. And I'll tell you, maybe I'm wrong, but this is bigger than it was in 2016, because in 2016 I said what we're going to do, but now I've completed more promises than I've made. I mean, I've actually completed more, right? Like, as an example, many of you were here, look at all those beautiful red hats, keep America great, that's good. But I never talked about, did you ever hear me prior to the election talk about Space Force? I never talked about it. We did Space Force, but did we ever speak about it? No. There were many things that we've done that we never spoke about, right? Right to Try, you know about Right to Try, right? They've been trying to get it for 44 years, Right to Try. That's people that are very sick, terminally ill, and they can't get medicine that possibly works. And very well, we have the greatest labs and the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest scientists in the world, we have the greatest medicines in the world. If they have something that they're pretty sure is going to work but is going to take another six years, I brought those times way back, by the way, way down, but they would travel to Asia, they would travel to Europe, they would travel all over the world to try and get a cure because we wouldn't sell them the medicine because we didn't want to take a chance on making the people sick. I said, ""Wait a minute, they're going to die. They're going to die."" ""Well, sir, we can't take the liability."" I said, ""Then we'll draw up a statement assessing all liability, taking all liability away from the country, away from the insurance companies, away from the healthcare companies, away from the doctors."" And with the great help of a lot of incredible Republicans, and we had some Democrats help us, we passed Right to Try, and you have to see how this works. Some people are being, many people are being saved. And you know, the drug companies didn't like it because they didn't want to take people that sick, because they didn't want it on their charts. I said, ""I understand that. We won't include that. We'll have a separate list over here."" They said, ""Oh, would you do that?"" I said, ""Yeah, I'll do that, I'll do that."" But I didn't talk about Right to Try. I never said I was going to get that done, we got it done. That was a tough one to get done. It sounds simple, but it was tough. There's nothing easy in this country. You know, they said to me, a friend of mine the other day, ""Who's the toughest country to deal with, President?"" He used to call me Donald. I've known this guy for a long time. I'd like to say 20 years, but it's much more than that. I just don't want to tell you how long, it's too long. And I said, ""Call me Donald. You've always called me Donald."" ""I can't."" He calls me Mr. President. I've known this guy forever. He used to call me, ""Hey, Donald, let's go out to dinner."" You know before, he'd go, ""Hey, let's go out to dinner."" Now he goes, ""Mr. President, sir, how are you?"" Right? How are you? But what we've done, and he said, he told me, ""What you've done, we've never seen anything like it."" So many people are saying that. We are all together doing something, not only in terms of the election, not only in terms of what we're doing right now. Don't forget, it's a long way to the election. You know, we have what, 10 months? That's a long way. This is my first stop of the year, first major stop of the year. This is it. And we start. By the way, let's do one of those polls right now, do you mind? Is there anything more fun than a Trump rally? Here we are. Anything more fun than a Trump rally? Here we are. We have the greatest phrase of all time, Make America Great Again, and all due respect, I'll never end … I'm a little superstitious. I'll never end it, Make America Great Again, but I see all those hats. I see all those hats, changing it a little bit, but Make America Great Again. I said, you know, today, we just hit the highest stock price in the history of our country. Your 401ks are at records, your stocks are great, but what it really means to me is jobs, more importantly, than anything else. We have the best jobs, the best everything, right? We just hit … I can't really say, Make America Great Again. Our military is rebuilt, $2.5 trillion. Our military is rebuilt. We're doing great numbers. Economically, our country is the strongest it's ever been. You have factories moving back into Ohio. You never saw anything like it, right? You had your best year. When I say Make America Great Again, what that sort of means is we didn't get there, but we did get there. Now, I have a new theme. It's called Keep America Great. Keep America Great. Now, I'm a very loyal person, and I am concerned about changing the theme because Make America Great Again I think was the greatest political campaign in history. I mean, crooked Hillary spent three or four times more money than I have spent. Crooked Hillary, wait, crooked … We should lock her up, I'll tell you. Crooked Hillary spent three or four times more. I wanted to be a little bit … I have to say, that was a great campaign, and I don't want to change it. I don't want to have this incredible 2016, then go with something, and if something ever happened, this country will go to hell, I just … You know the stocks I'm talking about, the records. You don't have records this way. You have records. Get used to it, because if that happened, you will see things happen that aren't good. But, I have to now say, do I want to change the greatest theme in political history, Make America Great Again, with Keep America Great, right? Let's take a little applause, right? We'll go Make America Great Again, you'd clap if you want that. Then we would go, Keep America Great, you'd clap if you like that. Okay, are you ready? First, Make America Great Again. Ready? Keep America Great. You know, that, I call that a free poll. That's better than a poll. Do you ever see these crazy polls that come out? We're doing great in the polls, by the way. Remember, I used to come out and talk about the polls? We'll start doing that very soon. We're doing great in the polls, but this is like a free poll. Somebody else would go out, they have all this money that they raised, and they give somebody $1 million, and they'll ask 200 people that question. Then, they'll say, ""Well, Make America Great Again is better,"" but I will tell you, I haven't heard one thing where that was true. With all of these … I would have said, instinctively, Make America Great Again could not be beaten. I've probably done this 10 times. I have never had it win. It's Keep America Great, and that's what we're doing, but we're going to use both. We're going to use both … Good. Keep America Great. We're going to use both, but Keep America Great. That's probably going to be the dominant theme. For eight years, the Obama administration enabled and emboldened- … the Iranian regime. They gave Iran $150 billion, including $1.7 billion- … in hard, cold cash. Can you imagine? No, no, can you imagine? $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion in cash? The foolish Iran nuclear deal financed Iranian aggression while allowing a quick path to nuclear breakout, that's what it did. By the way, it expires so soon. They can have nuclear weapons. They're not, as I said before, they will not have nuclear weapons. … They hit us with 16 missiles, and I said, ""How many?"" We were ready to go. We were ready to go. I said, ""How many? How many died? How many were wounded?"" ""Sir, none."" None? Pretty good warning system, none. How many were hurt? How many were … None, sir. So, we didn't do anything. We were ready. We were ready. Not that I wanted to, but we were ready. You have no idea. A lot of people got very lucky. … We have a lot of your Congressmen right now in Congress. They said, ""Sir, should we come with you?"" I said, ""No, stay back and vote."" They're voting on some pretty important stuff, right? But, we were able to get Bill. We thank you, Bill, very much, great job, great warrior. Thank you, Bill. Ohio Lieutenant Governor, Jon Husted. Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Jon. Great job. State Treasurer, Robert Sprague. Thank you, Robert, and you have a lot more money in the bank right now, Robert, as Treasurer, right, than you ever did? Ohio Supreme Court Justice, Judy French. Thank you, Judy. Great job. State Senate President, a man highly respected, Larry Obhof. Thank you, Larry. And, a woman who really has become a great friend of mine. She took over this party. We fought like hell. We had some other people that had their mind on taking over the party, but they'd never had a chance against Jane Timken, Jane. And, the man who is in charge of my campaign in Ohio, I had a choice of five people. I said, ""I like this guy's name."" I don't know why. His name is Bob Paduchik. Why do I like his name? I said ""Bob, how are we doing?"" He said, ""You're going to win big, sir."" Because, you know, you keep hearing, you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio. That's these guys. Once, I was leading Ohio by a lot in the poll. They never say that anymore. It's terrible. They were saying it when they thought I wasn't going to win, but we were ahead right from the beginning. … I said, ""Bob, let me ask you, just out of curiosity, I don't have these people. The leaders are not with us. Is that good or bad?"" He said, ""Sir, it's great. You just went up three points, would you believe this, by not having it?"" He said, ""Don't worry, sir, you're going to win,"" and we won by a lot. Now, I understand we're up by a lot more than we ever thought possible. Bob was fantastic. Thank you, Bob. … Then, one of these characters back there, they put me in a contest with the late great Abraham Lincoln, right? Who do you like better, Trump or Abraham Lincoln? I said Abraham Lincoln- I said, who do you like better? They say they did a poll on this. I think I remember the numbers. All I know is, we won against Abraham, Honest Abe. We won, 53 to 47. Can you believe that, Abraham Lincoln? I went back to the First Lady, I said, ""First Lady, I just beat Abraham Lincoln in a poll."" I don't know if they had polls back then, but Abraham Lincoln. I always say I can be more Presidential than any candidate that ever ran, than any President, other than maybe Abraham Lincoln when he's wearing his hat. I like Abe Lincoln, but when we're doing well, we have a lot of support. Do you know why? Because our country is doing so well. Our country is doing so well. When we went out, we started, and we went right to the top of the polls. It wasn't like these folks today. They are 2%, 3%, but they're climbing. We went right to the top from day one. We never missed center stage in the debates. Remember those great debates? We actually got high ratings. They don't get very good ratings anymore. They're like, it's like death, watching. I should watch. You know, I'm supposed to watch. It's like my job. Try and watch, watch the competition, but it's like watching death. … Did you see where Pocahontas is slipping, badly? Bernie, Bernie has gone up. He's surging, Bernie's, crazy Bernie, he's surging, and Biden doesn't know the difference between Iran and Iraq. He's gotten it wrong four times. He goes, ""When we took our shot at Iraq …"" No, no, no. They're all saying, ""No, no,"" they're screaming, ""It's Iran, Iran."" What? His son, right? Where's Hunter, where is Hunter? No, I went to one of them. I said, ""We have to have where is Hunter as a witness."" They said, ""What do you mean, where is Hunter?"" I said, ""That's his first name. I have now made his first name Where's. Where's Hunter?"" Here's a guy, made no money, got thrown out of the military forces, I think the Navy, got thrown out, had no job, had no nothing, so, he went from that to making millions of dollars a year as soon as Sleepy Joe became Vice President. He made millions of dollars a year. Would anybody in this room do that for millions of … I would. He made millions and millions of dollars a year. Ukraine took care of him. How about China? He walked out with $1.5 billion to manage, and he never did it before. He didn't know anything about oil and gas. He was making a fortune. So, where is Hunter? Where the hell are you, Hunter? I'll tell you, I sort of hope it's Joe, because he will hear where's Hunter every single debate, nine times a debate. Where is Hunter? … Howdy Doody. The problem is, a lot of people don't remember Alfred E. Neuman. Don't say that. You look much younger than that, I must say. You have Mayor Pete. I mean, give me a break. Can you believe Mayor Pete? This is going to be the President of the United States? How would he be against negotiating against President Xi of China? We just made one hell of a deal. You're going to see the numbers very soon, you know? One hell of a deal. They didn't like those tariffs. Thanks to Republican leadership, America is winning again, and America, most importantly, is respected again, respected like never before. You know, for years, NATO has taken advantage of the United States. We protect Europe from Russia, and the numbers have been going down for many, many years, 15 years, 18 years. The numbers is like a roller coaster down. I went over, and I said ""Folks, you got to pay your bills. You're delinquent. You're delinquent."" Then, they don't like me. They say, ""We like Obama better."" They should like Obama better. Obama would go in and say, ""Thank you very much for coming. We appreciate it. Bye-bye, I'm going back to Washington. I'm going back. I'll be violating the carbon footprint. I'm going to Hawaii to play golf."" I drive to play a round of golf at the course I own, it doesn't even cost them anything. He flies to Hawaii, nobody cares. If I drive 20 minutes, it's like, ""Donald Trump is playing golf today. He violates the carbon footprint,"" but just think of it. Think of where we've come. Think of where we've come. A great congressman from Tennessee, they have … It's a great state. They have early voting, very early voting, probably the earliest. He said, ""I don't know. I just left Tennessee."" This was in November. This was the election, 2016. He said, ""I just left this incredible state of mine, and I love that state. Sir, we've seen lines of people that didn't vote before, because they never were inspired to vote,"" and these are people that never voted. They had hats on, Trump. They have pins, on Trump, Trump, Trump, and Trump. They have the bands on, you know, like a Miss Universe, prom. It says, Trump Pence, and they've got buttons all over it. They've got shirts saying Trump and Trump Pence. I never saw anything like it. ""If every state is like Tennessee, sir, I hate to tell you, you're going to have one hell of a victory,"" and that's what happened, right? That's happened. You did it. You did it, and I think we're going to have bigger numbers, even bigger numbers, because I'll tell you what, we're a long way from the election. I think the crowds today are bigger than they were the day before the election last time. I really do. You know, Elizabeth Warren- … sadly referred to, she of great Indian heritage. Remember, I used to say, ""I have more Indian blood in me than she has, and I have none."" I turned out to be right. You look at what she's doing, you look at what she's saying, the lies, the deceit, the fraud, you see it all. We are going to do so great. It's got to be something that's going to be special. It's going to be for the record books. The Evangelicals called some of the greatest pastors, ministers, preachers, and they just called today, five of the most respected people. They said things that were incredible. They said, ""There's never been anything like this in the church that they can …"" Some of them have been doing it for 30, 40 years. They said, ""We have never seen enthusiasm like we see for this President and for this Presidency, all of us, like we have right now."" … He never said that before. Billy Graham wasn't somebody that would vote and say he voted. Franklin Graham said Billy Graham, maybe the greatest of all, maybe the greatest of all time, he said ""My father, Billy Graham,"" who was very old at the time and in trouble, he was in trouble, he was not well, ""he voted for Donald Trump."" What a great tribute that was to me. What a great tribute. Great family. Unemployment has reached the lowest level in over 51 years. African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American unemployment have all reached the lowest rates ever, ever, ever recorded. Wages are rising fast. They're going up very fast, and the biggest percentage increase, makes me happy, are for blue-collar workers. 40 million. Think of this, 40 million American families are now benefiting from the Republican child tax credit, each receiving an average of over $2,200 a year. Now, America lost … This is hard to believe, because you think, ""How could it possibly be true?"" but this is what happened. Probably, it's the number one reason I'm running. America lost 60,000 factories under the previous administration, 60,000. You wouldn't believe that it's possible, but I know it's true, because I've said it 50 times, and the fakers back there, they've never corrected me. No, it's true. No, it's true. If I were slightly off, if it were, if I was off by two factories, there'd be a headline, Donald Trump Told a Fib. Donald Trump gets to be a Pinocchio again. No. Think of it, 60,000 factories, plants and factories, closed, closed. They went to Mexico. They went to China. 60,000. It's not even … Take a look at a map and put 60,000 little dots. I mean, you wouldn't believe it could be that many, but it is, it's 60,000 closed, gone. They're all coming back. They're all coming back. Right now, just in a very short period of time, we've added 12,000 brand new factories, and many more are coming in. One of the reasons they're coming in is we've eliminated a record number of job- killing regulations, saving the average American household $3,000 a year. Total income gains for median households will reach over, ready? $10,000 a family. $10,000. Now, under the Bush administration, the $10,000, that includes what we've done in terms of median income. I'm adding in there the tax cuts, which are tremendous, $2,400. I'm adding the regulation cuts, I'm adding the whole package over $10,000. Now, under President Bush, it was $450. Under Barack Hussein Obama, it was $975. Under President Donald J. Trump, it's $10,000 in three years, three. In three years. Don't forget, President Bush, eight years, $450. President Obama, eight years, $975. President Trump, three years, not even, not even, not even, but three years, $10,000. We're going up. We're going up. … Clean coal. What they do with coal today is incredible, clean coal. With the help of energy workers right here in Ohio, the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far, number one. We were number one. … You know, there's a state known as Texas, and I won Texas by a lot, just like I won Ohio by a lot. How would you like to go into Texas and say, ""By the way, we don't want your oil or natural gas anymore?"" How about that Beto? Remember he said, ""I was born to be President."" Anybody that says that, I said, ""That's the end of his career."" Remember, he had the cover of the magazine? I won't mention the magazine, sleazebag magazine. He was born to be President, and right after that, he came tumbling down, but he's from Texas, so he was against religion, he was against oil, and he was against guns. Abraham Lincoln could not win in Texas with that platform. That's not a good platform. It's not a good platform, but you have people that want to shut down the oil industry. If you do that, you're going to shut down half your businesses. It's really more than that, and the rest of them are not going to be able to pay because the cost of this energy would be so expensive. We have all forms of energy. We have every form of energy, and we are doing great, but they want to cripple your state's economy. The voters of Ohio will never let that happen, never going to let it happen. Our air and our water right now is cleaner than it's been in 40 years. Sadly, I can't say historic because, you know, a couple of hundred years ago, there was nobody here, right? I assume that 2, 300 years ago was cleaner, probably. You never know, but our water and our air is as clean as it's ever been, and I took us out of that horrible Paris accord. I always say, ""How are you doing with the Paris accord?"" Don't ask. Saved trillions and trillions of dollars that was put in there to hurt us, in my opinion. It was put in there to hurt us. We were paying money to India. We were paying money to China. China's didn't kick in until 2030, we kicked in immediately. We had to pay money. Russia kicked in, in 20 … Let's see, they kicked in before. They were 1990, wait, they were 1996. That was a very dirty period of air, so, they didn't have … We kick in now, and that, it's just unacceptable. We would have spent trillions and trillions of dollars. We would have had to close up, I think, at least 25% to 30% of our businesses. Who the hell would make a deal like that, right? Who would make a deal like that? No, how unfair. You look at Russia. You look at China. You look at India. They all got these massive breaks. We got no breaks, and we're paying money. I say sometimes to France, ""How are the yellow vests working out?"" Because they don't like raising their taxes and sending the money to faraway places that they'd never heard of. So, we are in good shape. It took a certain amount of courage to do that. I said I'm going to get killed on this one, and you know what? I did it, and I was applauded, because the people get it. The people know what we're doing, and they're tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world. They're tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world. … I immediately canceled the Obama administration's job-killing catastrophe, which would have dealt a death blow to the United States auto industry, the Transpacific Partnership. It was a disaster. That was going to be worse than NAFTA. NAFTA, I always say, the world's worst deal. I think that would have been worse. It would have taken the car industry. It would have taken many of your industries. That was a setup for the United States to get fleeced. … That's going to include, because we take care of our great auto workers of Toledo, the home of Jeep. How good is Jeep? I've taken the toughest-ever action against China's chronic trade abuses, including tariffs on $370 billion worth of Chinese made goods, bringing billions and billions of dollars into our treasury. I gave some of that money, because they were targeted, to our farmers, and our farmers did just fine. Now, the deal is done, and the other deals are done, and the farmers are doing very well. We love our farmers, and they never complain. They never complain. You know, when they'd go, the fake news back there, they'd go and they'd talk- And when they come, the fake news back, they go and talk to the farmers. ""What do you think of President Trump? China is deciding not to buy anymore of this."" You know what the farmers would say, ""We're going to have to suffer for a while because there's China and there's other nations have been ripping us off for years. The President is right and we're with the President."" How great? How great? But our strong action paid off and we'll sign that terrific and fully enforceable Phase One trade deal with China. And again, we're keeping the tariffs on because we use that for other money. We are taking billions. Remember what I said? We're not paying for it. Because China devalued their currency and then they put a lot of money into the pot. We're not paying for it. And now they're starting to say, ""I guess he was right."" And our trade deficit, as a result, has come, has really come substantially down. It was just in the papers today. The trade deficit has come down. As a result of our actions, steel mills all across Ohio, you know this better than I do, are roaring back to life! JSW Steel is investing five hundred million dollars in Acero Junction. Republic Steel is reopening the Loraine Mill that they idled in 2016. Charter Steel is building a 150 million dollar mill in Cuyahoga Heights and Nucor is investing 85 million dollars at a facility in Marion, Ohio. Think of that. I think you do. The steel industry was dead and now it's vibrant. All told, American steel companies are currently making 13 billion dollars worth of new investments all across our nation. Think of that. They weren't investing 25 cents. The industry was dead. Now it's vibrant. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. We are finally putting America first! But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Washington Democrats are wasting America's time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts. Think of it. The day they came down that escalator it started. Who the hell else could they take in this stuff? Right? Can I get some credit for that? Most guys would have been in a corner with their thumb in their mouth saying, ""Mommy, Mommy, take me home."" These are bad people. The Democrat politicians we're fighting today are the same ones who took a sledgehammer to Ohio jobs in factories. They destroyed your factories. They destroyed your jobs. But they're losing and we're winning and America's comeback continues full speed ahead. On no issue have Democrat politicians more clearly betrayed the American people than the issue of illegal immigration. Far left radical politicians support deadly sanctuary cities and demonstrated their contempt, scorn, and disdain for everyday Americans and the American family. These jurisdictions release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob, attack, and kill American citizens but stop it. They want open borders. Can you believe it? And because of Democrats' open border policies, they want open borders. They want more people flowing. Come on in. Come on in. Innocent Americans are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals. As just one example right here in Ohio, you all know about it, an illegal alien went on a deadly crime spree, attempting to rape a 14-year-old girl. Then raping an murdering a 60-year old woman. Then shooting at a woman who took a shortcut through the park and was walking with her children. And finally the police came. We love our police. And they were able to apprehend this terrible criminal. Thanks to Democrat policies, MS-13 gang members… they're the worst… were allowed to infiltrate the country. You know I called them animals and Nancy Pelosi said, ""They're not animals. They're human beings."" Take a look at what's happened to her district. Her district is one of the most disgusting dirty… it used to be one of the best in the country. Now it's a disgrace what's happened. Drug dealings all over the place. The homeless they're not taking care of. Tents down major thoroughfares. What happened in San Francisco, in particular her district, and she lives in this beautiful house. But they turn all these arsonists out, including killing their victims with machetes, MS-13. They kill them with machetes. You know why? Because it's more painful than using a gun. Federal authorities recently discovered and rounded up more than 25 MS-13 gang members in Central Ohio. And they will be sent to jail or frankly, I they hold them… I don't know that they can hold them. They're going to be sent the hell back home. Last year alone, ICE officers, who by the way are heroes. These are brave people. I don't want to do it. You don't want to do it. Let's see, you can do it. You can do it. You can do it. Most of you wouldn't. I mean, I've seen it. They have these people that are like killers. And now the guys are here. And they want to call them a safe place. And they run in and they're swinging and punching. What the hell kind of a job is that? That's what they do. They're tough people. They're great patriots. Who the hell wants to do it? They're incredible, ICE. And they get scorned and we take out thousands and thousands of MS-13 members every single year. They throw them in the back of the van and we get them the hell out of our country. But ICE offices worked through Ohio police to remove one thousand two hundred dangerous criminal aliens from your streets. And on all your street, do you see the difference now between what it is now? We have a problem over there? Go ahead. Take your time. Take your time. Good, thank you. Great job. Thank you. Okay these people here, unlike you up there, these people have been waiting for three days so that they could be here. I don't know. You know what? If I had to wait three days, I think I'd like your seat better. I like your seat. But Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order, and justice. That's really the way it is. We side with law enforcement, with law abiding Americans, not law breaking criminal aliens. We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members from our country by the thousands. We are sending them home. And we will no let them back in. And I have to tell you, a lot of things are happening. You're going to hear about that in two seconds. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossing are down 75% since May. We have ended catch and release. Catch and release, you know what catch and release is? We catch them. We take down their name and we release them. What kind of crap is that? These are the policies that we inherited. You catch somebody, take their name. Say ""Please come back in three years."" Right? And we're releasing them back to the community. And if you don't do that everybody gets sued. Can you believe this? We have ended catch and release. The other one, beauty, how about that lottery? It's called VISA lottery. How about this? They put their hand… these people are going to America. Bomb. I will not use names because I'll be accused of something later. But from Honduras, what about it? El Salvador, we have… He's good. Only in Ohio can that happen. Who's the man that did that? Who is that? So anyway, but, in Honduras, Guatemala they have like this lottery. Now the people, I've gotten to know the government officials. They're good. They've made some good things. They said, ""Hey we need to take our people back."" They're getting their people back. Before, they wouldn't take them back. They'd send them here to go into our county. We'd bring them back under past administrations and then after that, they'd say, ""We're not taking them back. We're not taking them back. Take them the hell our of here. We're not letting you land your plane."" So we have the government flying the plane all over trying to get a couple prisoners, bad people back. Now they take them back. You know why? Because we said, ""Look, if you don't take them back, we're going to put tariffs on every single thing you sell."" Now they say, ""We'd love to take them back. We'd love to take them back. We'll take them back gladly, sir."" No, they couldn't get them back. We'd take off with these absolutely gang members an we'd bring them back and they wouldn't accept them. We couldn't land the plane. We couldn't get anything through the border. It comes through the border this way, not that way. But now they take them back. They've been good actually. They've been very good. Now we paid them a lot of money. We paid them 500 million dollars a year. Can you believe we paid them 500 million through El Salvador? And I said, ""Oh, there's not going to be any money anymore because you're not treating us right."" And they've been good. They've been great. They take them back. ""How many would you like us to take? We'll take as many as you want."" And here's the big thing. Ready? You ready? Today in the newspapers in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals we won't the big big beautiful lawsuit when they were all suing us. The wall is being built. We built it. We built already a tremendous amount. But we're releasing four million dollars of military construction funds to build the biggest section of the wall. It's literally being signed now and will be under construction very shortly in couple of weeks. And we've already built over a 100 miles of wall. How about that? 100 miles. And by the end of next year, we're going to have a lo more built. And it's already having a big impact. How about that, Democrats? ""Walls don't work. We want technology."" I said, ""What do you want to do?"" They want drones. Oh, good. When people are rushing, the caravans, when they're rushing, having a drone flying around is not going to help you do it. Okay? Nothing like… you know five years ago, the Democrats all wanted a wall. They just could never get I built. They didn't know how the hell to build it. I do. So we built 100 miles. I think probably more than that now. We have a lot under contract. But we won our big case just… I woke up. They said, ""Sir, we have good news. They overturned a horrible decision from the lower court. You can now fund the rest of the wall."" I said, ""Thank you very much."" Thank you, Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals have changed some. They want crime. They want gangs. I'm saying all this stuff and then I say, ""Gee, now I sort of understand why they hate me."" Right? But it's true. It's true. Their policies are a disaster. They're bad politicians and they're horrible policies but what they do is they stick together and then they're vicious. They're vicious, horrible people. I didn't say that. They're horrible people. What they do to people is as disgrace but they stick together left their party and joined our party. But we've done things nobody's ever done before. But the Democrats are taking their cues from socialist Bernie Sanders and that group. Omar, AOC, Talib. This is a jihadist woman, Talib. Talib. Boy, what a group but they're the leaders of the party. They're really my opinion dealers. That's what happened. That's how they got into this impeachment on this. The leaders of the party are… there's AOC, Talib, and Omar. And Pelosi beats them but she shakes and quivers and she's very soft. But you know who the leader of your party is? All of you. You. You're the leader of your party. Everybody believed me. Then she went down. Then she started coming up and then he went down. It doesn't help me to do it a year-and-a-half before the election. That's why, like with the Green New Deal, okay? I want to say great things about it. Okay? I don't want to knock it and then say, ""Oh, we're not going to use that."" I like it when they say, ""You no longer can fly airplanes. No longer can you have any cows in meadows. Right? No longer can you do anything."" We can't do anything anymore. The Green Deal, I love it. I think it's great. It should be debated. It should be debated rally it's a month before. You'll get to hear the real facts. But I'm tired of talking about this 10 months before the election. They can do more with the tape than they can do with a newspaper. No, they'll do it. You'll see it. Somewhere you'll see it, ""Trump supports his plan."" They are sick. Republicans will defend middle class taxpayers and the right to keep the doctor of your choice. We will protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And we will protect your pre-existing physician. You'll have your physician. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth. That is why I have asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Radical Democrats now have a party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the party of the American dream. We still have the American dream. Mitch helped a lot. He helped a lot. It wasn't so easy. Mitch McConnell. We're aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and it's bad. In 2018, drug overdose deaths in Ohio fell by… listen to this… 22%. That's not good enough but credit to opioid. And as we continue rebuilding our military, we have the star legendary Army tank factory in Lima. And we've authorized 441 new striker fighting combat vehicles and 453 new Abrams tanks to be built in the Buckeye State. That's a lot of tanks. So wait, just a quick story. Okay? I'm proud of this. So they had this Army tank plant, right, in Lima. And I said ""What's going on?"" ""They're closing it."" ""Oh."" ""They're closing. They're closing everything."" When I came they wanted to close everything. So I was president-elect I think right around at that time. And I went to Lima and went through the factory where they make these trucks, the plant. And they make the tanks. They make all of these Army vehicle. And I said, ""These people are amazing. You could never close this. You could never re-open it again."" They'd been doing this for many many decades and this factory was incredible. And I looked at the tanks they made. They're the best in the world by Abrams. They're the best in the world. I said, ""Wait a minute. If you close this, we're not going to be… where are you going to build tanks? This is the primary factory in the whole country. I think it might be the only factory in the whole country.""? ""Please send us 200 tanks."" ""We don't want to send you any tanks because we're going to kick your ass."" We're going to make our own tanks. Right? We've got to make our own tanks. So I did something, based on my instinct because instinct sometimes works better than anything else. Based on my instinct, I said, "" You can't close this plant."" I went through that plant. I spent two, three hours talking to people who worked there. I looked at some of the hydraulic and I'm, I love all in the world, tractors, all of that stuff. I know a lot about it. And I looked at the carvings. I looked at the metal. I looked at how perfect everything was that turns around. How perfect it fit. They put it on and it would fit like within 1/100th of an inch. And I said, ""You're not going to be able to do this anyplace else."" I said, ""And we're going to be expanding our military. We're going to be rebuilding. Who the hell's going to make our tanks if you close?"" I said, ""Keep it open."" I actually, it was all closed. Is there anybody from Lima? Is that a true story? Right? It was closed. They announced it was closed. It was all set to close. I said, ""You can't close this plant."" And now look, the numbers I just gave you. We're making almost 500 new tanks. You could've never reopened a place like that. It's incredible. And you could've never gotten those workers. They're really skilled people and if you did it would cost you billions and billions of dollars to do it. It wouldn't have been as good as we have. So that was something I did that I'm very proud of because I really over-rode a lot of talented people that wanted it to close. I recognized Israel's true capitol and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And we further recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, 52 years. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Ohio. And saying our present battle is the survival of the American nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, and fought so hard to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020. We have to win. You know, we have to win. Because all of these things that we've done can be undone. And you can have a country that goes to hell very very fast, very very fast. Only in this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And I have seen that dirty rotten swamp better than anybody else in America. A lot of crooked people, disgusting crooked people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the U.S.A. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Nobody knew that. It could've been done long before I got here. They had the technology. But we're ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years. Isn't that amazing? Whoever thought that was possible? Who would have thought that's possible? We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one big beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, ""In God We Trust."" We stand on the shoulders of generations of Ohio patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. From Cleveland to Cincinnati, from Dublin to Dayton, and from Columbus to Toledo, this state is the home of proud families and farmers, and miners, and manufacturers, and aviators, and astronauts. Ohio is where the Wright Brothers invented the airplane and where Annie Oakley got her gun. Ohio is the state that gave us American legends and American heroes like Thomas Edison, Neil Armstrong, and the great John Glenn. Ohio is the place where strong American workers mined coal, worked the railroads, and forged the steel that made America into the greatest most powerful nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Ohio, the best is yet to come. Because together, we will make American wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Toledo. Thank you."
Trump,"Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, ""things are very peaceful here."" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, ""Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson."" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, ""You got to get … you can't protect yourselves."" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, ""Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less."" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, ""Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country."" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, ""What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing."" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we … I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing … Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, ""Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?"" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, ""I'm sorry, this number's no longer working."" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, ""How do you take it?"" I say, ""Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?"" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, ""Oh, it's COVID."" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, ""Kung flu."" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, ""Where do you get the energy?"" I say, ""I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice."" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, ""Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready."" I said, ""Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point."" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, ""Sir, we're ready to go."" I say, ""Let's go."" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, ""Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am."" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, ""Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes."" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, ""He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar."" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, ""Thank goodness. Thank you very much."" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, ""Sir, are you ready?"" I said, ""I'm ready General, where are we going now?"" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, "" Sir, we can now leave the stage."" I said, ""Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,"" and he goes like this, ""Right here, sir,"" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, ""General."" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, ""General, I've got myself a problem, general."" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, ""General, I have a problem,"" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, ""There's no way."" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, ""General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing."" It's true. So I said, ""Is there like something else around?"" ""Sir, the ramp is ready to go."" ""Grab me sir, grab me."" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, ""That will be a story too."" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really … It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, ""General, get ready because I may grab you so fast."" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? ""I don't want that, general."" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, ""Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, ""General, I'm sorry,"" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, ""Here was the number one trending story."" I call my wife, I said, ""How good was that speech? I thought it was a …"" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, ""How good was it, darling?"" She said, ""You're trending number one."" I said to our great first lady, I said, ""Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good."" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, ""Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?"" I said, ""Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit."" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, ""What does it have to do with water?"" They said, ""You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water."" I said, ""I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?"" She said, ""Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive."" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist … Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, ""Oh, the protesters were lovely."" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? ""Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy."" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't … It'll say, ""A comment from Joe Biden,"" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, ""Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it."" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? ""Sir, would you sign for this plane?"" Now it's actually two planes. ""Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?"" I said, ""How old is the original or the one we have now?"" ""Sir, it's 31, 32 years."" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the … They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, ""Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do …"". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, ""No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was."" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, ""Cancel the contract. I want it canceled."" I said, ""General, can you cancel the contract?"" He said, ""Yes sir, I'm very proud of it."" ""Oh good. Cancel it."" ""Okay sir."" ""By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?"" ""Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir."" ""How much is it, general?"" ""$250 million."" I said, ""What?"" ""Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill."" ""You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million."" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, ""$250 million?"" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, ""Oh, he exaggerates."" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great … I say, ""General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general."" ""Why sir?"" ""Because I don't want to pay 250."" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, ""No way, no way, no way."" The next week they say, ""No way we're doing it."" The next week they said, ""How about $5 billion?"" I said, ""No way. No way."" The next week they said, ""$4.8."" I said, ""Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?"" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, ""$4.5 is our best offer."" ""Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready."" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, ""Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,"" and they say, ""Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, ""No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, ""Angela, that's a long time,"" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, ""No Angela, that's not working."" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, ""Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?"" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, ""What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?"" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, ""Get them in."" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. ""We need more money. We always need more money."" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, ""Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?"" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, ""These are super left liberals and they didn't like it."" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, ""They're animals."" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, ""These are animals."" And Nancy Pelosi said, ""These are human beings. They're not animals."" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, ""We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs."" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently… We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit… Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, ""Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you."" I said, ""Yeah, why do you call them the elite,"" I said, ""why?"" ""Well, they're not elite."" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, ""You won, but you have to come back and redo it."" It's almost like, ""Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good."" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, ""Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy."" They all said it. And they came back and they said, ""We don't like what you did with your paperwork,"" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to… Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same… Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he… Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against… There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great… They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, ""Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore."" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, ""Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance."" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, ""Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor."" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? ""Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country."" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, ""Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone."" I said, ""Thank you very much."" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. ""Sir, we've just taken 100%."" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, ""In God we trust."" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you."
Trump,"ell, thank you very much. And hello, Tupelo. This is great to be with you tonight, the great state of Mississippi. The great state of Mississippi, and by the way, the birthplace of a gentleman, not too many people heard of him, Elvis Presley. But to be with thousands of incredible patriots who put their faith in God, family and country. Right? Four days from now, this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next governor, Republican Tate Reeves. Great guy. Great guy. Under Republican leadership, jobs are booming, confidence is soaring, wages are rising, crime is falling, and our nation is stronger than ever before. We're now an economic powerhouse. We've never been in a position like it. We've rebuilt our military and we have financial strength. And by the way, for those of you with a thing called 401ks, the stock market hit, today, another all-time historic high. Unemployment in Mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded, ever recorded. That's not bad. That's not bad when you're on the debate stage and you say, ""We have the best economy we've ever had. We have the best military we've ever had, the best unemployment and employment numbers we've ever had."" Said, ""Got the best president we've ever had."" Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Thank you very much. And very importantly, we've confirmed more than 158 brand new, beautiful federal judges to uphold our constitution as written. In a very short while, we'll have 182 federal judges. President Obama left us 142. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Can you believe that? You're supposed to leave none when you leave office, but that didn't work out too well. And just days ago, the United States brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice. We have great military. It was very, very depleted. When I came into office, it was very, very depleted, but it ain't depleted anymore. Yep. al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader… Look, you've heard about it for a long time. I kept saying, ""Where is al-Baghdadi? That's the one I want. Where is he?"" And then, by the way, the following day, we got number two. I don't know if you read about that. But he was the founder and the leader of ISIS, and he's dead. And Baghdadi, he was a Savage and soulless monster, but his reign of terror is over. American special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell, I guess you could say. He spent his last miserable moments on Earth cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the American warrior that was right there going right up. No enemy stands a chance against the righteous bite of the United States military, and Mississippi loves our military, that I can tell you. And our military loves Mississippi. America is winning again, and America is all, over the world, respected again. It's about time. But while we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Democrat party has gone completely insane. The radical left is determined to transform America into a country you would not recognize. We are the ones standing in their way, and we will never get out of their way. It will be easy. From even before we won the election, the far-left Democrats and the fake news media right back there… Look at all of them, oh. It's too bad we get such good ratings because if we didn't, they wouldn't be here. Look at how many. It's like the Academy Awards before it failed. Right? And you know why it failed? Because they disrespected us. But the media and the Democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership, trying to impose their will and to thwart American democracy by any means necessary. You see what's going on. First, they engineered the Russia hoax. That was a total hoax, the single greatest lies ever foisted upon the American people. Then the Mueller witch hunt, it never ended. With 18 angry Democrats and an unlimited budget, let's go get him. That didn't work out too well, did it? That fizzled. And a lot of bad people along the way. And now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi- … and shifty Adam Schiff, Shifty. And the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment witch hunt. This is one I never thought I'd be involved in. The word impeachment… To me, it's a dirty word, not a good word. Totally phony deal. They know it. Everybody knows it, and that's why we've never had greater support than we have right now. It's true. And if you think you have a lot of people in this room, all you have to do is go outside. You'll see a lot more people trying to get in. So if anybody wants to give up your seat, please just walk out. Anybody want to leave? Because there really is. There's no place better to have a rally, to have a good time, and to also, at the same time, be very serious than at a Trump rally, especially on Friday night in Mississippi. We could have done this one on Monday night. I said, ""Let's do Friday."" Right? Yesterday, the Democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million Americans, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment I won. But the people here that are highly sophisticated, though, long before I won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, the horrible newspaper, fake, fake, fake Washington Post, declared, ""The campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun."" At least they gave us 19 minutes. Yesterday's vote by the radical Democrats is an attack on democracy itself. But I'll tell you, the Republicans are really strong, the strongest I've ever seen them, the most unified I've ever seen them. Right? The most unified I've ever seen them. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, and extremism. The Democrats' outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do-nothing Democrats out of office in 2020. Make no mistake. They are coming after the Republican party and me because I'm fighting for you. They don't like it. This is different. They've never had anything like this. Well, they've never had an election like 2016 either, have they? They never have. They've never quite figured it out. You're the man. And they know they can't win, so let's try and impeach him. How about that crazy representative, Al Green, right? ""You know, we got to impeach him because we can't beat him."" I don't think so. Right? I don't think so. Al Green, he's another beauty. The Democrats, the media, and the deep state are desperate to stop us. And it's not me, it's us. It's all of us. It's 63 million, but it's much more than 63 million. Much more. And right now, our numbers are higher than they've ever been before. They've never been this high. But they want to stop us because they know we are here, and that's what we're doing, and that's what's taking up so much time. We're draining the swamp in Washington. Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the fact that all of their spying… Spying. They actually spied on my campaign. Can you believe it? I mean, you know, they try and say, ""Well, we were actually just checking things out. Oh, that's wonderful."" The lying, the falsifying over the past three years plus, before I ever even announced they were spying. I guess they knew we were going to win, right? But over that past more than three years is finally being exposed. And remember this, that truth is a force of nature. Desperate to conceal their misdeeds, the Democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the Bidens, just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked Hillary's shocking and very many misdeeds. 33,000 emails. 33,000 emails disappeared, but she said they only had to do with her working out at her daughter's wedding. 33. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. She's a beauty. How about last week? Did you hear? I don't know who Tulsi Gabbard is, but I know one thing. She's not an agent of Russia. And Jill Stein, she's a greenie. That's fine. We love the environment, everybody in this room. You know, right now we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that we've ever had, and yet we're number one in the world in energy, by far. We took over. But I don't know Jill Stein. She ran last time. I don't know, but I know she's not an agent of Russia. And when Hillary made those statements, two statements, both of them, ""They work for Russia, they're agents of…"" I said, ""You know, when she made that statement about me three years ago, it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement."" She made it about them. Everybody laughed because of what we proved. But I'll tell you what, these are very bad people. These are very dishonest people, and the media is worse than all of them. But think about the preposterous hoax the Democrats are now trying to peddle. I've just beaten, with no… Look, look, we didn't have too much political experience. I did a good job, built lots of buildings all over the place, had great success in show business. Just did one show. It was called The Apprentice, and it was a big success. 14 seasons. And when I left, Crazy Arnold took over. It didn't do too well. It was dead. It was dead from the first episode. I saw him, I said, ""Oh, it's terrible. What have they done to this beautiful show?"" Arnold? But think of it. I've just beaten, with no political experience, the Clinton dynasty, the Bush dynasty, the President Barack Hussein Obama dynasty. And President Obama worked harder at defeating me than crooked Hillary Clinton did, right? He was all over the place. It's the only time I've actually seen him work hard, when it came to trying to beat Trump. True. True. Remember he said… Remember he said, ""He will not be president""? Well, that didn't work out so well. And then they figured they could take us out a different way, very dishonesty, right, with the lying and the spying and the leaking. And we are kicking their ass. I'll tell you. In the delusional Democrat fantasy, I'm now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1% Joe. I used to call him 1% because you could never get 1% in the primaries. Then he got brought out by Obama out of the trash heap, became vice president. But we've now named him Very Slow, Sleepy Joe. Very slow. He's gotten slower and slower. I'm afraid if he gets a nomination, he'll be so slow we'll have the lowest-rated debates in history as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history against crooked Hillary. In fact, I don't even think that Sleepy Joe will get it. But many people are running. So, you know, it's so early. I don't want to talk about their campaign. Oh, did you hear Beto? Beto? Did you hear Beto? Beto. Oh, that poor bastard. Well, poor, pathetic guy. He was pathetic. Remember the arms a-flailing? Remember that? You know, he ran against Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz won. He spent almost 100 million dollars, and Ted Cruz… And I helped Ted, and we campaigned together, and it was good. But I used to watch him. Then when he came onto the really big stage, this crazy stage, I noticed he was flailing with the arms, and he was standing on tables. He was standing on countertops. I said, ""Does he ever stand on the floor and speak?"" But he's waving his arms and going crazy, and I said, ""What the hell is he doing? What is he on?"" And do you remember he made the statement that he was born for this? Anybody that says he was born for this, they're in trouble. I used to have guys come into my office, ""Sir, I'm the greatest salesman. Nobody can sell…"" You know, the truth is anybody that says they're a great salesman, usually they're not a very good salesman. It's true. It's those sneaky ones in the back that don't talk, that you don't know about. They're the ones. But Beto was nasty, and he said that he was born for it, like he was born from heaven. He came down. And if that's the case, some really bad things happen, because he made a total fool out of himself. And he came out of Texas, the great state of Texas. He came out of Texas, a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be. So he was a nasty guy, but he had a couple of policies that don't work well in the state of Texas. Right? He was against religion. He was against you having a gun. And he was against oil. So you come from Texas, you don't like religion, you don't like oil, and you don't have guns. I don't know. That's not a good combination in the state of Texas. That's not good in Mississippi, either. I don't know it's that good anywhere. Nah, he went back home to Texas, and hopefully we won't be hearing about him for a long time. It's amazing how cold you could get so quickly, but he was a nasty guy. But in the twist… Oh, Alabama. Love Alabama. I love Alabama. I love Alabama. It's a great place. But in the very twisted and corrupt world of Adam Schiff, after beating the entire political establishment, and that means Bush and that means Clinton and that means Obama, they have me supposedly saying to myself, ""Well, let's see. I got a guy named Sleepy Joe Biden. How do I beat him? How do I beat him? How do I beat this guy? He's such a great."" Clinton, she was easy. Right? Obama was easy. The Bush dynasty was. But sleepy Joe, I'm worried about, right? So then I said to myself, ""Gee, I guess there's only one way. Let's call up Ukraine for help. These people are sick. These people are sick. Now, these dishonest people will take the last little sliver and the first little sliver and they'll put it, because they're so damn dishonest, and they'll just say- … ""Let's use Ukraine for help."" That's what they're going to say. And they won't show the laughter, and they won't show the sarcasm, and they won't show the fun because they're the most dishonorable people almost on earth. It's a disgrace. But we say it anyway. And here's the good news. The people get it. So they have a brand new president in Ukraine. Good guy, by the way. And I call a brand new person, a man I have no idea who he is, and I'm on a phone, right? And I know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of country, many people listen. And I'm on the phone, and they want me to say to this brand new president, just got there, called to congratulate him, ""Please, could you help me please?"" I don't know who he is. I didn't know his name until I looked down the card, I see. And he's a nice guy, and hopefully he's going to root out corruption because Ukraine has tremendous corruption problems. And one of the reasons I held up money, very important, corruption. But the other reason… Why isn't Germany and France and UK and all of these European nations that are right there… Why aren't they doing things that they're supposed to do? Why is it always the United States? So I made this call, had this wonderful call, and the transcript proves it was, as I said, perfect. It was perfect. It wasn't like almost… It was perfect. It was totally appropriate. I made it at the behest of people to say, ""Could you call and say hello?"" Now I'm an honest person, anyway. But do you think, when I'm making a call to a newly-elected president of a country, that I would say something improper when I know there are so many people listening on the line? Many people. Whoever the hell wants to listen, they listen, and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people. And remember, the new president of Ukraine is speaking to the United States of America, the president. I guarantee he's got a lot of people listening, too. These people are sick.  no pressure. They must think we're nuts, to be honest. It's all a phony deal, this whole impeachment scam, to try to undermine the 2020 election and to de-legitimatize one of the greatest elections, maybe the greatest … I mean, let's give George Washington credit, but everybody expected he was going to win, that we've ever had. So my phone call, which was totally perfect and appropriate, and if you want to read the transcript, you see how perfect it was, but they don't quit. But what you should do is take a look at the behavior of Sleepy Joe. So I quote, ""I said"" … Let me act like him. I've got to speak really slow though, and … ""I said, ‘You're not getting a billion.' I looked at them and I said, ‘I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor isn't fired, you're not getting the money. You understand? You're not getting the money.'"" Then he goes, at the end … I didn't know he had this kind of energy. He goes, ""Well, son of a bitch, he got fired."" You know, in a certain way, I was impressed because, I mean, I didn't think he had the energy, the brain power. It's turned out he doesn't. By the way, he's dropping like a rock. When you're at 1%, there's always a reason. He should be there fairly soon. As you know, the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden got fired after threatening to withhold, I think it was $1 billion or something in aid, was the prosecutor investigating his son's company, that was paying Hunter Biden, a guy just got thrown out of the Navy … He was paying them millions of dollars, even though, working for an energy company, he had no experience with energy. He knew less about it than this young … How old are you? Six. This young, beautiful person in front of me. Six. And this young six-year-old is smarter, so I think I'd basically go with her. So what is it all about? It's called a payoff, but you know what? The fake news, they apologize. I watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings, Anderson Cooper. Well, the hatred, I mean, between him and Fredo. You've got Fredo and … That's Cuomo, Fredo. I call him Fredo, like from the movie. Now I watched Anderson Cooper and I watched him apologize for even asking the question to Biden. The good news is Biden didn't know too much about what the hell he was talking about. Remember Biden said, ""I don't know these people. I don't know them. I don't know them.""  we're dealing with life, right? He never spoke to him. Unfortunately, the next day … In the world of the internet, in the world of smart people … That's why I like Beto, he wasn't smart, couldn't handle it. I told my wife, I said, ""See, it's not so easy."" I told our great First Lady tonight, who people love. They love her. When Beto quit, he quit like a dog. When he quit I said, ""See, people think this is easy. This isn't easy,"" but it just worked out that way. But Biden said, ""I never met the people, never met the gentlemen."" Unfortunately, in about 10 seconds, a picture came out where they're playing golf together, but he never met him. So now you'll ask him, he'll say, ""No, we played around a golf. We were together for three hours. I never mentioned the fact that they're paying my son millions."" Oh, no, no, no. … Well, they might be watching us. I guess they do watch us. He used to interview me. He was so nice. Prior to running for politics, he was so nice to me. It was like they were love fests, but I don't want anything to do with him. They were love fests. What a thought. He's weak. He's a weak person, but they're all weak. But let me just tell you something. We need honesty with our media. We need honesty, because the New York Times, the Washington Post … And by the way, I don't know, you probably read it. We threw them out at the White House. We don't show them anymore. If somebody wants to go and buy them; we threw them out. And they came into my office and then I got to get back to this guy. Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? We had a tee shirt made, ""Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter?"" Poor Hunter. He then came out, he did the Morning Show. That was the last we've seen of Hunter. That wasn't good. The morning of his father's very bad debate, but it's, where is Hunter? But before I say the final thing on Hunter and then we put him to rest for a while, we got rid of the Washington Post and the failing New York Times. We got rid of them, right? We don't have them in the White House. I said, ""No, you could … People can go out and buy them, but we don't"" … We used to have them stacked up, and I'd go in and I'd see a meeting with my people and they're dealing with China, South Korea, or somebody. And I'd go into these offices; I'd see 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. I keep trying to figure out who's worse. And one day it's the Times, one day it's the Post. It's like top each other, they're so bad. It's so phony. In my opinion, it's virtually corrupt. I've never seen it. You never have a good story. I mean, even when we got al-Baghdadi, the Washington Post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric. Where did that come from? The other thing, if Obama would have done it … because, look. This guy built ISIS. The caliphate, it was the size physically of Ohio, the state of Ohio, the great state of Ohio. That's a big, lot of land. 7 million people, and they were the ones, the orange jumpsuits. I called a lot of the parents after we did this and I talked to them and they were … How can you be happy? But they were so thrilled that we got this animal. They were so thrilled. But you know what? And you know what? We don't do it for … We do it because it's right. That story was a massive story. That was the biggest, maybe the biggest, one of the biggest, ever. Bigger than anything. That story disappeared so fast. Done. And that's okay. I didn't do it for the story. I did it because it's the right thing to do. But if I were a Democrat, they'd be talking about that story for weeks. With me, they don't even want to … They actually played it down. And actually, and I'm happy about this, Conan the dog got more publicity than me. And I'm very happy with that. I'm very … Conan is incredible. And Conan's coming to the White House in a few weeks. But it is true. Did you ever see a story disappear so fast? I mean, if Obama had that story, that thing would be going on for another seven months. They'd be talking about his bravery. Oh, so bravery. But again, 142 judges he gave us. Remember that. How can you be a great … They always say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges. We got two Supreme Courts. Great ones. Great judge. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, great judges. By the way, did you ever see any human being treated worse than now-Justice Kavanaugh? Did anybody ever? Was any human being by these people, these horrible, horrible people that we have to deal with? Anyway, just to finish. So Hunter then goes to China. Now I'm dealing with China right now. They don't like me too much. They dream about the day when somebody else … And would they like to have … How about this? You give this son, who has zero experience with investing, too, you give him $1.5 billion to invest, meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars, and the biggest guys on Wall Street can't get it. He walks out with $1.5 billion. And then there are other places also, I understand. Folks, it's disgraceful that the press doesn't cover it for what it is. It's a payoff. It's a payoff. And how would you like to have Sleepy Joe, with the son getting all of this money from China, become president and take over the China deal? They are not liking me. They had the worst year that they've had in 57 years. Their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now, billions and billions of dollars. We're taking billions and billions of dollars, and you know what we're doing with some of it? Just a small portion, but 100%, they're taking care of … Our farmers got $16 billion last year and $12 billion the year before because they targeted our farmers, because they know the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers. So they targeted them and they brought the $16 billion down to practically nothing. And they thought our farmers would say, ""Oh, we don't like Trump."" They did just the opposite. They said, ""We know he's doing the right thing because we've been ripped off for so many years."" But I said to him, I said to Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Purdue, a great guy; I said, ""Sonny, how much did they spend buying our corn and soy beans and all of our agricultural product?"" He said, ""Sir, $16 billion."" I said, ""Good, I'll make it up."" And we're going to have a lot leftover. So we will have, pretty soon, over $100 billion in money paid into the United States Treasury by a country that never gave us 25 cents. They only took. They only took. So when I said to the farmers, ""We're going to send you $16 billion, and it's already been sent. And it's been split into $12 billion the year before."" I mean, think of that, $28 billion. I said, ""Compliments of China."" And we had a lot left over. Not bad, right? Not bad. You think Obama would do that? I don't think so. You think Hillary would do that? I don't think so. You think Sleepy Joe would do that? I don't think so. He wouldn't know what you're talking about. On Tuesday, the proud people of Mississippi will send Democrats a clear message. It's very important for this reason, as well as the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst. But you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption. They're corrupt. Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician. You know when he made that phony speech where he made up a really horrible speech and said that I said it, I said, ""Oh, I'm going to sue him."" They said, ""Sir, I'm sorry. You can't."" He's got total immunity because he made it in Congress. Can you believe this? But here's the good news. At least we have a forum, we have a place we can talk so everyone knows what's going on. A bunch of phony people, but this is why we have to send a signal and why you have to make Tate Reeves your great, new Republican … Right? Republican governor, right? Hey, he's a great guy, too. And all I know is he's loved and respected by your current governor, because Phil is some piece of work. Phil is so confident. I wanted Phil to run for a certain office, then I wanted him to do something. I've tried to get him, but some guys are confident. Phil said, ""No sir, I've been doing this all my life. I love the people."" He built the most beautiful African-American museum. Phil, he's the greatest, but he built the most beautiful … But he's got confidence. And he said, ""No sir, I'd been doing it. I don't really want to do that."" In other words, he said, ""That's enough."" … Oh, we love our police, right? I love our police. We love our police. He'll oppose sanctuary cities, which is just terrible. They're terrible. And Tate will always defend your Second Amendment. So Tate's running against a liberal Democrat named Jim Hood. Now all I know about Jim Hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked Hillary Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama. Isn't that nice? He wanted Obama to win so badly and then he wanted Hillary to win. And that's not the kind of guy we need here. Not in Mississippi. He's supported by extreme leftists like Stacey Abrams, who, by the way went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentlemen from the great state of Georgia, Brian Kemp. And they came in with … Oh, they brought them all. They had President Obama, they had Michelle Obama, they had Oprah Winfrey. They came in, and all he had was Donald Trump, and we won. We won, fairly easily. But Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote. Do you believe this? I mean, some of these people, they want to give them education. They want to give them this. They want to give them free healthcare. They want to give these people, that come into our country illegally all benefits, and he opposed our travel ban, which is so important that we won in the United States Supreme Court to keep terrorists the hell out of our country. And Jim Hood went to the United Nations and opposed your right to self-defense. If you don't want a far left Democrat running Mississippi … Wait a minute. How's this guy? I can't believe this is a competitive race. It's embarrassing. I'm talking to Mississippi. I'm talking to Mississippi. I can't believe it. I don't think that he's going to be the right guy. I think the guy that you want is Tate Reeves. He's going to be fantastic. He will be a great, great governor. Tate, come on up. Tate. Thank you, Tate. Tuesday, go out and vote for Tate. He'll never let you down. And don't kid yourself. Your Second Amendment is under attack, but not with him. It's under attack. So we're also joined tonight by a man who is truly, and I've sort of said it a lot, but he's been a great governor and he loves your state. He loves the people of this great state, Governor Phil Bryant. Where's Phil? Come up, Phil. Come up. Oh, he's central casting. Look at him. Come here, Phil. Thank you, Phil. Thank you. Thank you, my Phil. What a job. What a great job. You have to continue that whole thing going forward. So another man who's a warrior is a friend of mine. Whenever there's a problem, he's there. He's always there. He'll be right at the front. He is tough. He is smart. He's brilliant, actually. And he loves this state and he loves you people. Senator Roger Wicker. Roger. Thanks, Roger. Thank you, Roger. And somebody, I'll call her up because, believe it or not, she's running with me. She just ran. I said, ""Cindy, you just ran. You just won."" She said, ""No, I have to do it again."" She's running in 2020. I thought she'd have six years. I said, ""Cindy, it's only like a year."" Cindy Hyde-Smith. She's incredible. She's tough and smart and strong, and she's with us all the way. Cindy Hyde-Smith.  Trent Kelly, Michael Guest. Incredible people. And your next Lieutenant Governor, Delbert Hosemann. Your next Attorney General, Lynn Fitch. Your next Secretary of State, Michael Watson. Great people. Your next State Treasure, David McRae. State Auditor, Shad White. Agriculture Commissioner, Andy Gipson. Insurance Commissioner, Mike Chaney. And former governor, a man that nobody's ever heard of in this room, I'm sure, but the truth is he's a legend in politics and a great guy. He's a great guy, Haley Barbour. … Hourly earnings are up 9% in Mississippi since the election. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories in our country. Under my administration, we've already added nearly 10,000 new factories, and many more are coming in as we speak. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts on average $2,000 to $2,500 per family, bringing almost $1 trillion back home to our shores. What's happening? You couldn't get the money. The big companies, they couldn't get their money back both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint. They brought back almost $1 trillion now because of us. All put to work. We slashed the largest number in history of job-killing regulations, and we ended the war on American energy. We are now the number one producer of energy by far anywhere in the world. For decades, you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals. Mississippi lost 40% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. Two of the worst deals ever made by our country. 100,000 Mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that, and that's awful, and a big price to pay for Washington's disloyalty to the American worker. That's what it was. It was disloyalty, stupidity, corruption, lots of reasons. But now you finally have a President who is loyal to you, and I am. I'm a fighter for your jobs, for your wages, your factories, your families, and your dignity. We're stopping China from ripping us off. We're stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the United States where we lose our money, we lose our wealth, we lose our jobs, we close our factories. That's not happening anymore. It's reversed. We were the sucker country for years and years, but we are not the sucker country anymore, and they all know it. We're replacing NAFTA … and that was a disaster, NAFTA … with the brand new US, Mexico, Canada agreement if Nancy Pelosi will ever put it up to a vote, which is questionable. Nervous Nancy, she doesn't want to give the people of our country a victory. She's very busy doing other things. Having fun. The USMCA will be a massive victory for Mississippi's farmers and also includes powerful protections for Mississippi auto workers, manufacturers, and everybody else. It's a great agreement. About time we got rid of NAFTA. The do-nothing Democrats need to stop their madness and pass the USMCA right now. The last administration's horrendous Trans-Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the US auto industry, but I proudly, first thing, withdrew from that job-killing calamity. Under our policies, Toyota has just announced a $170 million investment in Mississippi and 400 new jobs at its facility … did you ever hear of this place … Blue Springs. Blue Springs. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects all over the world. We take care of other people. We take care of other countries, but we don't take care of our own. They knowingly decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. They deployed our military to protect … think of this … immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. I ask those wealthy nations now, I respectfully the other day said to the King of Saudi Arabia, ""King, we're going to help you, but you've got to pay."" And he was great. No, he was great. He was great. He said, ""But nobody has ever asked before."" I said, ""But I'm asking."" And billions of dollars will come in, and we're protecting a great ally. We have a country that spends billions and billions of dollars in our country buying military and other things. But we said, ""You're very wealthy. You have to pay,"" and they're going to pay. And that's true with many countries by the way. That's true with many countries. They never respected us. They could never believe it. I said to one country … I have great respect for the Prime Minister of Japan. I said to Prime Minister, I said, ""How did you get away with this for so long?"" And he looked at me and he couldn't really answer it because how the hell did this happen? We're protecting 94 countries. Ask China, ""How many countries are you protecting President Xi?"" And they look at me like, ""What a stupid question. We protect one. China."" You ask President Putin, ""How many countries are you protecting President Putin?"" And he looks and he goes, ""Russia."" You ask other countries … we're protecting at least 94. In fact, so many they can't even tell me. I've been trying to get an answer for four months. So many they can't even tell. It's crazy, but it's all beautiful the way it's happening. A lot of good things are happening. But these same politicians poured precious American blood and treasure into the sands of the Middle East while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay. Our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you, to take your money, to take your jobs, to redistribute your wealth all over the globe, wherever they wanted it. But I don't like that. I don't like that. The great sellout has ended, and it ended the day I took the oath of office. That was quite a day. After years of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation. We are finally putting America first. Our policy of never-ending war, regime change and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of American interests. It is the job of our military to protect our security, not to be the policemen of the world. Proving the wisdom of this approach, we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in Northern Syria without spilling one drop of American blood. Not one drop. Actually, I have to be honest. One soldier stepped on a nail. That's true. I said, ""Don't tell the press that because they'll say, but one soldier stepped in a nail."" I said, ""How bad was it?"" ""It's okay."" I said, ""Don't mention it please."" They always like to mention exactly what happened. You can take it a little bit low key. Stepped on a nail. Not a drop of blood. And we don't have to defend the borders between Turkey and Syria. They've been fighting for 1000 years. But what we do is we did keep the oil, if you don't mind. We kept the oil. We kept the oil. And we'll distribute that oil, we'll help out the Kurds, and we'll help out other people. We'll also help out ourselves if that's okay. Past leaders, foolish military adventures turned far away nations into very, very dangerous war zones. Then they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted nations and regions. I don't think so. I don't think so. We did not fight them over there only to invite them over here. We don't want to do that. To protect our communities, my administration restricted migration from terror-prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures. Toughest ever that we've ever had. No issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party as that issue by the Democrats. They want open borders, which mean crime. They want sanctuary cities, which means crime and drugs and death. After bleeding the middle class dry, Democrats threw open our borders to the world, flooding our communities with poisonous drugs and criminal cartels. Republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities. We are now building a wall. We're building it. We're building it. And you think that was easy? The Democrats, they didn't want that wall. I got money for everything, but when it came to the wall, not 25 cents. Not 25 cents. But we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military and we took it from here, we took it from there. Or we had to go to court and all of a sudden we start winning cases. We're winning cases now. Winning a lot of cases. But the wall is going up rapidly. It's going up rapidly. And this is a very serious wall. This is the exact everything they wanted. I went to the border patrol, incredible people and ICE. Incredible people, tough people. They love our country. And I said, ""Give me the specifications for the wall."" They said, ""Well sir, we'd like steel, but would also like concrete and would also like rebar."" I said, ""Well, what do you want? Which one?"" So I did all three because it's a different form of cutting. You can cut through steel, but you can't through the concrete and then you can't through the hardened rebar. We got it all. ""And we also need see-through, sir. Got to see who's on the other side."" That makes sense, right? Not just concrete. It's more expensive what we're doing, but we're giving and we're building … we should have anywhere from 400 to almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year. It's going up fast. In all the right areas. In all the right areas. That was a tough one. And the Army Corps of Engineers is building their hearts out. They're great. Great people. We believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country. And thanks to our tireless efforts on the Southern Border, tough place, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May, and we are faster than ever securing the Southern Border. And soon it will be, when the wall is completed, secure like it's never been before. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. They right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders. 27,000. You know what that is? And they are keeping people out. And I want to thank the President of Mexico. He's an excellent person, great man. And we appreciate it. And the reason is that our Democrats won't even approve things called loopholes. They're loopholes. That's a horrible name, right? That means it's a loophole. That means you can come in illegally and lots of things. Catch and release. You catch them. Then you've got to release them. By law you've got to release them or they'll arrest the border patrol agent if they don't release. It's crazy. But we could end this in 15 minutes, but they don't want to do it. They don't want to do it. They're obstructionists. They're colluders. And we can't let it happen. That's why you have to go with Tate Reeves. Tate's going to send a big signal, by the way. It's a big signal. It's great for you. He's going to be a great governor. It also sends a big signal to these radical left, crazy Democrats. It's very important that Tate wins. Very important. We're also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like Mississippi, which has banned sanctuary cities because Phil Bryant said, ""We're not going to have them,"" and Roger Wicker said, ""We're not going to have them. And Cindy said, ""We're not going to have them."" Democrats' sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE … and they are heroes, I wouldn't want their job. MS-13, they walk right into those nests … they call them a nest … and they start swinging. You never saw anything like it. I'll say, ""You know what? Better you than me."" Let's see who would do good. He'd do good. That guy. That guy would do good. Most of you wouldn't do too good. No. I mean, these guys are tough guys and they love our country. Who would do it? They're moving thousands of people from MS-13. These gangs are the worst people. These people, these are not human beings. You know, I said that once before and this crazy Nancy Pelosi said, ""How dare you say they're not human?"" You ever see these people? And they slice people up with a knife because it's more painful than using a gun. And then I have to defend myself when I say they're animals. But you know what? I never changed. I didn't say, ""Oh, I'd like to apologize. I'd like to apologize. Crazy Nancy."" And you got to look at her district in San Francisco. She's spending all her time on this crap or this impeachment stuff. Take a look at what's happening to the great city, once, of San Francisco. It's thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles and everything you can imagine floating in the streets in the best neighborhoods. Nancy Pelosi, go home and fix your district, Nancy. Go home and fix your district. Go home and fix your district. If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and border patrol, vote for Tate Reeves. Tuesday. Got to get out. You got to get out. Got to send the signal. Let it be a big victory too. The Democrat party has never been more extreme, you know that, than it is today. The Democrat healthcare agenda would obliterate Medicare. I will always protect Medicare for our seniors, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. Always. We'll always take care of them. Virtually every Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. Well, the governor of Virginia executed a baby. Remember that whole thing. After birth, after birth. Some people never heard of it. He said the baby is born and then he starts talking to the mother. Nobody ever heard that. That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream. Nobody has done more for the African American community than the Republican party. And we're also the party of Abraham Lincoln. We can't forget that. People forget. Abraham Lincoln. Honest Abe. To lift up distressed communities, we created opportunities zones. So incredible. So successful. Including 100 new opportunity zones right now in Mississippi where money is now flowing in to build and to fix. And Tim Scott, I give him so much credit from the great state of South Carolina choices. They can go out, get a doctor, we pay the bill, and they don't have to wait six weeks, four weeks, two weeks. We had people waiting in line. They weren't very sick. By the time they saw the doctor, they were terminally ill. Now they go on and they go and they go outside and they find a doctor and we take care of our great veterans. The great rebuilding of the American Armed Forces has included massive investments in the military and facilities in Biloxi and Gulfport and Jackson and Starkville. And Roger has been fantastic. And Cindy Hyde-Smith has been fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To protect America's security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It's not the same country anymore. Nothing's easy, but it's not the same. And I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. For years you watch as your politicians apologize for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Mississippi. The next step to victory begins on Tuesday right here in your great state. With your support we will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not ever going to back down from perhaps the greatest victory in political history. And you know today with the new stock market at an all-time high, it's … I will tell you something … if we didn't win this election, that stock market would be in one-half. It was heading in the wrong direction. It was going to fail. And if they ever did anything bad, if they ever do anything bad to us, if they ever succeed in their wildest dream, which will never let them happen, that stock market will crash like you've never seen a crash before. And you will not be happy with your 401ks like you're happy right now because they don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing. And I'd like to speak well, but the leadership, they have no clue. They're just very vicious people. Actually, they're sort of mentally violent people, but we've got it under control. It always helps when you didn't do anything wrong. I always say, ""How do you impeach a President who didn't do anything wrong?"" So we're going to send a signal by sending a terrific new Republican governor to Jackson. On Tuesday, you're going to get out and you're going to vote, and you're going to give up whatever you have to give up. You're going to leave work maybe a little early or maybe get there a little late. Tell your boss I said it was okay. I will give you a pardon if I have to. I'll give you a one-hour pardon. But with your help, we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. And you have great congressmen here and I'll tell you, I want to appreciate it, fellas. Warriors, you're warriors. You are warriors. What was it? 196 for and nothing against, right? That doesn't happen with Republicans. It doesn't happen. I always complain. I always say the Democrats are lousy politicians. They have lousy policies. Open borders, sanctuary cities, but they have one thing. They stick together and they're vicious. The Republicans have great policy. In many ways they're better politicians, but they're not as vicious. Thank you, darling. I appreciate it. They're not as vicious, but they have a tendency to split apart. The Democrats don't seem to have any Mitt Romneys. We do. We do. I don't know. Maybe he'll get better. Maybe he'll get better. We'll see. We'll see what happens. Maybe he'll get better. Just let it be fair, but they don't have that. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, ‘Made in the USA.' Made in America. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Can you believe that? Within 10 years it will be over. When they told me that, I said, ""That's incredible."" We're going to end the AIDS epidemic within 10 years. It's funded. Nobody would have thought we could do that, but we're doing it. We'll have it ended in America in 10 years. The AIDS epidemic. Who would've thought? We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto and we always will. You'll never see it disappear. In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, pioneered technology, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And today it's greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. That's what we're doing. That's what happened in 2016. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We'll get so tired of winning. I don't know, Mississippi. You're winning. You had the best year you've ever had. You have the best, Mississippi, the best year you've ever had in the history of our country. Mississippi. Your statistic. Mississippi, aren't you getting tired of winning? I guess not. So Phil doesn't come to me and say, ""Sir, please, we're willing too much. The people of Mississippi can't take it anymore."" I don't think you'll ever have to make that trip. I don't think he's ever going to have to, and I don't think Tate will ever have to make that trip. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Mississippi, the best is yet to come. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Mississippi. Thank you."
Trump,"Thank you. Thank you. I love New Jersey and I'm thrilled to be back right here in the Garden State. Thank you. The Garden State. Together we're achieving historic victories for New Jersey families. You see it every single day. The New Jersey unemployment rate has reached the lowest of all time. More people are working today in the state of New Jersey than ever before. I have to tell you more people, almost 160 million, are working right now in the United States. That's the highest level of employment in the history of our country. A lot of countries aren't doing so well, just so you understand. Tomorrow we will replace the NAFTA nightmare, one of the worst trade deals ever in history, with the incredible brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA. A massive win for New Jersey workers, New Jersey farmers, New Jersey union people, New Jersey manufacturers and everybody. Weeks ago we also signed a fantastic new trade agreement with China that will boost New Jersey exports and defend New Jersey jobs. $250 billion coming in. Oh that's going to be so nice. We're restoring America's industrial might like never before. They're all coming back. They want to be where the action is. After years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the United States military. Thanks to the incredible courage of our warriors, the greatest warriors in the world, the ISIS caliphate has been totally destroyed and its savage founder, and leader, al-Baghdadi is dead. Weeks ago, at my direction, the US military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans, and actively planning new attacks, but we stopped him cold. Yet Washington Democrats, like crazy Bernie Sanders and nervous Nancy Pelosi, they opposed our action to save American lives. They oppose it. They oppose it. You know the roadside bombs that you see hurting our people and lots of other people so badly? The legs, the arms, wiped out. No legs, no arms. Soleimani loved that. That was his weapon of choice. We didn't like him. He's not around anymore. Well we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the Congressional Democrats are obsessed with demented hoaxes, crazy witch hunts, and deranged partisan crusades. It's all they know how to do. The do nothing Democrats. They have spent the last three years, and probably even before I came down on that beautiful escalator with our beautiful future first lady, trying to overthrow the last election. We will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in the next election. We are going to have a victory that's even greater than 2016. This November we are going to win back the House, we are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep The White House. The American people are disgusted by the Washington Democrat … You see it. You see it. Which is worse, the impeachment hoax or the witch hunts from Russia? But we're going to be signing up millions and millions of registered Independents, Democrat voters. Today I had the best polls that I've ever had since being elected. The best we've ever had. Remember I used to go over polls? But I only used to talk about them when I was doing well otherwise I wouldn't. We had our best polls. Americans of all political beliefs are sick and tired of the radical rage filled left Socialists. I never saw anything … What's going on in this country … What's going on in this country, really the Democrat party is the Socialist party and maybe worse. Voters are making a mass exodus from that party and we are welcoming them to the Republican party with wide open arms. The Republican party is doing great. We are privileged to be joined tonight by a courageous leader who left the Democrat party because he has had enough of their extremism, enough of their Socialism, and enough of their vile hoaxes and scams. He's had enough. I tell you he really is, he's a brave guy. He just said, "" I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. It's a hoax, it's a scam, I'm not doing it."" We called him, ""You're our kind of guy. Let's go."" It didn't take much because he believes like we do. We are truly honored to be here with the newest Republican member of the House of Representatives, your great congressman, Jeff Van Drew. I have to tell you a few weeks ago Jeff was one of the few brave and principled Democrat lawmakers, in all fairness we've been after him for a longtime, who stood up to the House Democrats and the outrageous abusive power that you see going on right now. They can't win an election so they're trying to steal an election. It's not happening folks. It's not happening. Jeff had the guts to defy the left-wing fanatics in his own party, and to stand tall in defense of our constitution, our freedom, and democracy itself. I just want to … I have to tell you, I've gotten to know him really well over the last couple of weeks. He's a great guy, he's a brave guy, he shares our values. He supports lower taxes, not bad. They want to raise your taxes. How did that work Jeff? How did you get elected with that one? Less regulation, a strong national defense. He loves our military, loves our vets, and police. He is a tireless champion for the state of New Jersey. He loves your second amendment, which is under siege by the Democrats. Jeff, it's an honor to be with you. Please, please. Thank you. Thank you man. We have tens of thousands of people outside. If anybody would like to give them your place please let us know, but we have thousands and thousands. Tens of thousands. Jeff gave me a number, he said, ""175,000 people signed up."" Is that a fact? 175? I think he's on his way. I think he's on his way. Thank you Jeff, great job. Thank you Jeff. Thank you Jeff. It's been a little bit of a story. You see the fakers back there? Fake news. Fake. You know if another candidate has 1,000 people they say he spoke to a massive crowd. If they have 10,000, like Pocahontas went into Central Park in New York. This young men could have 10,000 people, you know that, in Central Park. She had 10,000 people like in Central Park. I said, ""What's the big deal?"" They made it, ""Oh the crowds are so large."" Jeff just told you he had 175,000 people sign up. Seriously you have to see outside. They know because they have to follow, they're trailers. I call them trailers. But they're fake. They're fake. They're not honest. Let me just tell you, so here's the story, so we have these massive crowds that fill up stadiums every single time. We have tens of thousands of people outside. They never mention it. They never mention it, so maybe they will tonight. But that's an all-time record. This is not a brand new place and unfortunately it holds 10,000 people or less. We set the all-time record. You know why? Because for games … See the floor packed with people? For games you're playing ice hockey or basketball, so we broke the all-time record in this house. It's a wonderful house in a wonderful community. Also in Wildwood, like we're in the middle of winter. There is nobody in the middle of winter and it's a great place in the summer. Those streets are packed all the way back to the airplane practically. But on June 2nd everybody has to do us all a favor. Number one you have to get out and vote Republican. Get rid of these clowns. You have to get out and vote for really a brave man. What he did was incredible. Jeff Van Drew, what he did was incredible. Get out and vote. He's going to have a big victory. He's going to have a big victory. We're grateful to have with us this evening some wonderful friends of mine, people that I've known forever, your former governor who did a terrific job, Chris Christie. Chris. Great Chris, great job. Your wonderful Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt, what a job he's doing. Thank you Doug. Thank you Doug. My campaign's two great New Jersey co-chairs and I think we'll play for the state … You know they all say Republicans can't win. Tell me why? They said, ""Should you move this to the Meadowlands?"" I said, ""No, I want to be in South Jersey. We want to be with our friends."" But we could have filled up the Meadowlands arena two or three times. Maybe we'll do it during the summer. Should we do it during the summer? Maybe. But two brave guys, two great politicians. People that love our state. State senators Mike Testa and Joe Pennacchio. Joe Pennacchio. Thank you Joe. Thank you. Thank you. Two incredible New Jersey natives, you've never heard of Kellyanne Conway have you say something. Thank you Kellyanne. I just want to thank Republicans because what they've been doing is incredible. Republican leadership in this country we're winning, winning, winning like never before. We're winning again and we've got a party that's a very different part, a much stronger party, a much more inclusive party. We have a party that we love. We have a party that has the votes. We have a party like they've never had before. The Republican party respected again. I have to say this, America is winning again and America is thriving again like never before. Since the election we have created seven million new jobs. The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration, listen to this one, in United States history. That's a good fact, the lowest in history. Thank you man. We have a great veteran up here and he said, ""We love you. We love you."" The veterans. Are we doing good for the veterans? Thank you. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country. Ever recorded! Women's unemployment is at a 65 year low. Sorry about that. Soon it's going to be historic. Another couple of good months it'll be historic. 65 years for women. In the eight years before I took office over 300,000 working age people left the workforce. They had no choice. In just three years of my administration 3.5 million people have joined the workforce. Nobody believes it, including the fake … The workforce. Nobody believes it including the fake news. If I would have said that during the campaign that we were going to produce numbers like this, the fakeness would have been hitting me. He's exaggerating. He's lying, Pinocchio, Pinocchio. The press is very dishonest. More than two million millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5% every year, which is a record. A record number of Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working, another record. Under the Trump economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of anybody. You don't hear that because this is a blue collar boom. It's very nice. It's about time. It's about time. It's been many, many decades. Earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10%, first time ever. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased, listen to this, by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. Median household income is at an all time high. For President Bush, in eight years it was $450, over eight years. Think of this for a second. Under President Barack Hussein Obama, for eight years it was $975, so eight years, eight years, 450, 975 under your favorite President, and when you include the tax cuts, the regulation cuts that nobody's ever cut taxes like this. Nobody's ever cut regulations. That's why all these jobs are being built. Under President Trump, for three years, the number is almost $10,000, and that's three years, and it's going up. It's going up very substantial. That's a big difference. New business applications in New Jersey have just soared to a record high, and we have lifted 10 million people nationwide off federal welfare. They're off. They are off federal welfare. Nobody would've believed these numbers. Someday they're going to write the true story. Our child tax credit alone is delivering $2,200 a year to 40 million American families. We have ended, so importantly for you, the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We don't need anybody else's energy anymore. It's so nice. What happened in the last three years with energy is incredible, but extreme liberals in Washington want to shut down U.S. energy, including through the so-called Green New Deal. Close your factories. Get rid of your cows. You don't have too many cows in Wildwood, but if you do, they're gone. We will never sacrifice America's energy independence. Took us a long time to get there, and we really picked it up over the last three years. What we've done is incredible, pipelines all over. Pipelines are good. They're underground, they're good, environmentally sound. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most. These are the communities that really have suffered. We created, with the help of a great gentleman from the state of South Carolina, You know who I'm talking about? Tim Scott, right? Senator Tim Scott, he's an incredible guy. He really is. He came to my office and he had this idea that he's wanted to do for a long time. Senator Tim Scott, opportunity zones, and jobs and investment are now pouring into nearly 170 newly designated opportunity zones right here in New Jersey, all over the United States. Billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and not government dollars, they're flowing into the opportunities zones into areas where investment was dead. For decades, politicians ran for office promising to protect American workers, but then they went to Washington and they lined their pockets with special address cash, and they shipped American jobs and dreams to other countries. They closed up your factories. They got rid of your jobs. They didn't have to pay taxes. Globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob our factories, steal our farms and ransack our communities. Not anymore, not anymore, because we are defenseless no more because long last you have a President who puts America first. Is that okay? The United States laws, listen to this number, and you know if it was wrong, the fake news would be all over me, and I've been saying it for three years. The United States lost 60,000 factories and plants. Think of that. You wouldn't think that's possible because of stupid trade deals, because of bad leadership. During the 16 years of the two prior administrations, under just three years, my administration has now added 12,000 new factories, and many more are being built and they're pouring back into the United States, because that's where the action is. That's where they want to be. They are pouring back into our country, new plants and factories. You see them all over. I passed two of them coming in, brand new, beautiful plants and factories. They're pouring back in. This is where the action is. This is where they want to be. I see the leaders, they say, ""It's incredible what happened to your country."" I said, ""Don't tell me that. We want you to have your companies build plants in New Jersey and other places,"" and that's what's happening. But on no issue have Washington Democrats thoroughly betrayed the American people than the issue of immigration. Left-wing, radical, politician support deadly sanctuary cities, and remember, a sanctuary city is a jurisdiction that refuses to hand over criminal aliens that are in local law enforcement custody. Instead, they order them to be released into your community. What the hell is going on? What is going on? Once set loose, these criminal aliens are free to continue their crimes spree against innocent Americans. Right here in New Jersey, your state's Democrat leaders have instituted sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your community. For example, Cumberland County, we all know Cumberland County very well, right? Good luck with this one. They released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child. He is now at large, free to search for another innocent victim. They didn't want to give him to ICE, and I want to thank ICE, because the abuse they take and the incredible job they do. Right here, another criminal alien was arrested for a violent assault in New Jersey. The sanctuary jurisdiction of Middlesex County defied the ICE request to detain him. Local authorities released him and he went on to commit a gruesome triple murder. I could read these cases, honestly, I could read and state these cases to you all night. I could state these cases to you all night. No American should ever be hurt, harmed or killed because left-wing politicians, Democrats, decided to shield and shelter… Look, look, wait. You have criminals that are on the streets that should be in jail. You have criminals that on the street that should be taken the hell out of our country and brought back to where they came from. By the way, ICE has removed thousands upon thousands of MS-13 gang members, the most brutal people. You don't want to do that job. Maybe you do, a couple of tough people up there. Anybody want to be with ICE? You got a lot of tough people in New Jersey. New Jersey is different. I think New Jersey is different. No, but these ICE people, they love our country. They're proud and they're tough people, and they'll go right into a pack. They call it a pack and they start swinging. Everyone's swinging or they end up standing up. That's the end of that, and you know what they do? They bring the MS-13 and many other gang members and other members back to El Salvador, back to Honduras, back to Guatemala, back to Mexico. I want to thank Mexico because you know what's happening, right? Thousands and thousands at this moment, 27,000 soldiers from Mexico, protecting our Southern border. I want to thank the President. Democrats stand for crime, corruption and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order and justice, and say what you want, but those are the facts. We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members. We are literally taking them by so many, thousands and thousands, and we're bringing him back. Thanks to our tireless efforts of border patrol to secure our border, we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row. We have the numbers down by 75% since spring, 75%. We have ended catch and release and really, look, I had another party. I could get anything. If I wanted to spend money on anything, look with the military, we got two trillion dollars, right? More. Two trillion, all made in America, right? Everything. Best planes, best missiles, best everything, made in America. If I wanted to build anything, the only thing they put the whole weight of their party, they didn't want us to have the wall. They knew it worked. Many of them voted five years ago for a wall. They just didn't know how to get it built. I do. But what happened is through a series of court cases and other things, the money has won, and we are now building that beautiful wall, and this powerful border wall is going up at record speed and we just reached over 100 miles of wall, and by next year, we'll be over 400 miles, and shortly thereafter it will be complete. A lot of people were saying a year ago, ""He didn't build the wall yet. He didn't build the wall."" Let me tell you. When you have the strength of a party that has the House, okay, hopefully they're not going to have the House for long. We'll have a wonderful new speaker, will get rid of Nancy Pelosi, nervous Nancy, nervous Nancy. We'll have Kevin McCarthy who's been fantastic. We have to win back the House. But think of this. The wall, so many people were saying, ""Build it."" Well, it's not easy when you have the weight of an entire party and they control the House, not easy. We did it and frankly we were building the wall through the help of the military, the Army Corps of Engineers anyway, but you know what? Now we actually have the money and it's going up very rapidly. In all due respect to Mexico, we like Mexico very much, and we've gotten along great with Mexico, and the President's a friend of mine, and I think he's doing a fantastic job. It's a tough situation. But Mexico is in fact, you will soon find out, paying for the wall. Okay? They'd hit you with that. Now the wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by Mexico, and it's an advantage for Mexico, too, when you think about it. The wall is a vital barrier for blocking deadly drugs from pouring into these communities. What we're doing is stopping drugs at a record number. It's still anything that comes over is too much, but we're blocking it at a record number. I'm also very proud to report that we won a critical Supreme Court victory yesterday on immigration. We will now be finally able to enforce federal law, and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer funded programs. They were killing our country, killing our country. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now. Frankly, they're crazy. These people are crazy. They're taking their cues from socialists like Bernie. Left-wing lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of health care that would strip 180 million Americans of their private health care plans, which many people like. The plans of every Democrat running for President would demolish the economy of New Jersey, where half a million new New Jersey workers are employed at some of the best and most innovative health care employment companies. We have them working at the companies, and we have people getting great health care. It's been so long. It's finally working and they want to destroy it. The Republican party will never let it happen. We are saving your health care while the Democrats are trying to take away your health care, take away your doctors, take away all of the good care that we fought, and we fought hard, and we're doing well and now we're doing better. By the way, some time prior to the end of the year, we're putting in for a new middle income tax cut, a very big one. But we're making health care better and much, much cheaper. We've done a great job in running it and we've given you a lot of alternatives. We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will, the Republican party, pre-existing conditions, we saved it. We are stopping surprise medical billing and making everything transparent. That's a big deal, and that will take effect starting in about two months from now. Everything's transparent. You'll be able to see pricing. You'll be able to go and price other hospitals, other doctors. It's going to be an incredible thing. Nobody believes I was able to do it, but we did it. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and the plan of your choice. We are lowering drug prices. The Democrats are increasing drug prices. We are fighting the lobbyists and special interests. We are serving you and how are we doing? We're doing good, right? But because of price transparency, we are getting it done. We're approving more generic drugs than ever before in the history of our country. That means they come in, frankly, they're just as good as the big names, but they sell for 80% less in some cases. We are unleashing innovation to cure diseases of all kinds. We are cutting out the rich middlemen and delivering prescription drugs directly to the consumers. These are all things that we had to fight like hell to get. We're making less paperwork for your doctors and giving you easy control of your medical records, which is a big deal for a lot of people. We are prohibiting hospitals from hiding their prices and charging hidden costs. You go home, you say, ""Oh, I'm feeling better. The doctor was fantastic,"" and then they send you a bill for $25,000. That's the end of that. All of a sudden the doctor wasn't so good, right? We are making companies compete for your business. We are repealing burdensome taxes. We have accomplished more than any President in the first three years of their term by far, not even close. We have provided health insurance options, 60% cheaper than Obamacare, and we have historic investments in treating kidney disease, HIV, pediatric cancer and Alzheimer's disease. We're making so much progress. We have just passed a thing that I think is great. I never understood. For 45 years, they've been trying to get it passed. We've just passed a thing called Right to Try. You know what that is? So, we have the greatest doctors, the greatest technicians, the greatest labs in the world, and we'll have a drug that's looking good, but it's going to take five more years, and by the way, we've brought the timing way down from 12 years to half of that, but it takes years to get it approved. You have people that are terminally ill. If they have money, they go to Asia, they go to Europe, they go all over the world looking for help. If they don't have money, they go home and they die. What we did is a thing called Right to Try. People sign something and they don't hold the country responsible. They don't hold the drug company responsible. It's called Right to Try, and they get the newest, and the best, and the latest medicine where it's looking good, but you're not going to have it for five more years, and you know why they didn't do it? Because they didn't want to hurt anybody, except the problem is the people were going to die soon. I said, ""They're terminally ill. Let them have it."" We sat down with a great group of leaders, Republican leaders, and honestly, we had some bipartisan support and we got it done. They've been tried to do it for 45 or so years. We got it done. You have to see the results, and I've seen some of the results. Some of the results are incredible. We've transformed veteran's health care, including through VA choice, right? VA choice. For 48 years they've been trying to get veterans choice. I thought I had the greatest secret. You know, I haven't been doing this that long, so four years ago, I'm campaigning for president. Everyone said, ""No, he's only having fun."" Yeah, it's some fun. This is a lot of fun. Right? But for 45 years- But for 45 years they've been trying to get it Veteran's Choice. So I come back one day, I say to my people, ""I have the greatest idea. I am so smart."" I am like the smart- I have an idea because the veterans are waiting online. They're waiting online for two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, ten weeks. Some are okay and they end up being terminally ill by the time they see the doctors, too long. And I said, ""Folks, I have the greatest idea."" All of my people, I say, ""I have the greatest idea. I'm so smart. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to send all those people that can't see a doctor, we just can't get them to see a doctor. We're going to send them down the road to private doctors and we're going to pay the bill and they're going to get fixed up."" Right? So smart. But you see, I said I was smart and they looked back at me and they said, ""Sir, we've known about that concept for 45 years. We just can't get it approved."" But I got it approved. And I got it approved about 11 months ago. And the VA is doing fantastically well. Our veterans are doing great. That was a big thing. That was a big thing. We also got accountability. Where people could mistreat our veterans, do whatever they want, they could be sadistic. They could be so many other things. They could steal, they could rob. You couldn't do anything, you'd keep them. You couldn't do a thing. We got accountability. Now you look at him, you say, ""Get the hell out of here. You're fired, you're fired. Now you can fire. They've let go of more than 8,000 bad people. We have reduced opioid deaths for the first time, and very substantially, in 30 years. And we are modernizing critical vaccines. We're doing a great job with vaccines. We are creating a pathway to buy drugs from Canada, that are much, much cheaper, in Florida. Governor Ron DeSantis came to me. He said, ""Sir, this system is so bad."" And you can't fix it unless you have democrat votes, that's why you got to vote the house. You got to get us back the house. They say, ""Sir, we can buy the drugs in Canada for 50% less."" The same drug made in the same factory, made by the same company. 50% and we can give the benefit for the people that live in Florida, or Colorado, or New Jersey, or wherever you are. This has been going on for a long time. No president has wanted to do it. You know how long it took me to make that decision? I said, ""If you can say 50%, or 25%, or 15% buy it. Do it. Go."" And I gave him authorization, ""Do it."" We are protecting Medicare for our nation's seniors. Democrats want, and you know this, Democrats want to raid Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants. And you know, we all have a heart. We all have a heart, but when you tell people to come into our country, like this clown governor of California, come into our country. They're all going to come. If they think they're going to get free education, free healthcare, they're all going to come. If you don't say it, they're not going to come. Because who would even think this? Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. Ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth. And that is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. Look at what's happening to their cities. Los Angeles, it's so sad. What you see is so sad with the homeless and the way they don't take care of the homeless. San Francisco, starting in New York. You could take a look at what's happening to our cities run by Democrats. It's a disaster. They don't know what the hell they're doing. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream. Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. That's what it is. It's one of the greatest moments. It's probably the greatest movement in history. The 2016 election was probably, I mean you could say, the greatest election in the history of our country. And now we have to do it again to keep it going. It's like a giant tree, you plant it, but it takes time to grab on. We need this next election so badly. The good news is, it's much easier, because here I've done it all. I've achieved more than I promised. I never told you about Space Force. We got Space Force. I never told you about all of these things that we got. We are a big tent party in the true idea. It's big ideas, and we have a big future together. This country has tremendous potential, if we don't blow it. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we pass bi-partisan, criminal justice reform. They came to me, they couldn't get it done, including many conservatives. And these people that I fight every day, they came to me, ""Help, help, help. Criminal justice reform."" I got it done. As soon as I got it done, they don't even want to mention my name. I got it done. I got people to vote for it that they could have never gotten. President Obama tried, he couldn't get it done. President Bush couldn't get it. They couldn't get it done. That's okay. They couldn't get it done. I got it done. I got it done. And after I got it done, and I mean solely got it done, and after I got it done they had news conferences. They're thanking people that I never even heard of. The only one they didn't think was President Trump. And I got it done, but that's the way it is. That's why I always say you have to thank yourself because nobody else is going to do it. We're fighting to give school choice to every child in America who needs it. During National School Choice Week, we reaffirmed that no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school. School Choice, very important. Democrats don't want that. To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 brand new beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. And two great Supreme court justices, two great ones. As we rebuild our military, we have authorized over $160 million to support our warriors at a place called, huh, McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix. Have you ever heard of those places? Have you ever heard of those places, New Jersey? $ 160 million, two great places. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Nobody else was going to do it. They've been trying to do that one for 52 years. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of New Jersey. My friends. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. I really mean that, it's the survival of our nation. And if you would have had the other party winning this last election, instead of your market being up 72%. Instead of your 401ks being up numbers that you can't even believe where your wife or your husband says, ""Darling, you're the most brilliant person in history. For years, you've been losing your ass with 401ks. Now you're making a fortune."" Right? Right? Now you're making a fortune. I have people coming up to me all the time. I had one gentlemen come up, ""Sir. Thank you, sir. You've made me look so smart. My wife never respected me for anything, not anything. But now she thinks I'm a great investor. Thank you."" 401k. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for it to secure, then we must devote everything that we have toward victory in 2020. We have to. And by the way, when we talk about inheriting victory in 2020 in our Nation, just so you understand, under a big tax cut biggest tax cut plan in history, guess what you have? You have a business, you have a farm, you have a small business, no more inheritance tax, no more what we call death tax. So if you love your children, they won't have to mortgage the plant. They won't have to be mortgage the farm, as the expression goes. They won't have to mortgage anything, there's no tax. If you don't love your children, don't leave it to them and then you do have a problem. No, I'm only kidding. Does anybody here not love their child or their children? Because if you don't… There's one man raising his hand. Nah, that's a big thing. No more estate tax, no more death tax for your small farms and business. Those are things that people don't even realize. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And I never even knew the swamp was this bad. Swamp is bad, bad people. A lot of bad people in the swamp. Bad people in the swamp you thought this was going to be easy, right? A lot of bad people. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. That's what's happening now. We will enact trade deals, the greatest deals ever made. That result in more product proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase ""Made in the USA."" Beautiful. For decades we had politicians that didn't care about that phrase. That phrase didn't mean anything to them. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine. Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic, can you believe this, in America in 10 years or less. We've already started the process. And it could have been started sooner by the past administration, they chose not to do it. I chose to do it. Think of that, ending the AIDS epidemic within 10 years that we've started. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious Liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms, which is under seige. By the way, our second amendment is under siege. In Virginia, they want to take your guns away. It's just the beginning. Never going to happen as long as I'm President of the United States. That I can tell you. But above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American ways. And we believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we will always live by the words of our national motto, In God, We Trust. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, very much, everybody. From Morristown to Vineland, and Patterson to Pennington. From Camden to Clifton, all the way down the shore to Ocean City and Sea Isle and Stone Harbor. And right here in Wildwood, New Jersey. This has always been the home of the proud, loyal, and very, very incredible Americans. And my friends, so many people in this group, I know them well. They're tough. They're smart, they're great people. It's called Jersey. This is the state that pioneered the boardwalk, the diner, and the motion picture. And gave the world American greats like Thomas Edison and Frank Sinatra, old blue eyes. Frank Sinatra. He was a piece of work, that I can tell you. New Jersey is the state where George Washington led a die hard band of American patriots to victory at Trenton, and Princeton, and Monmouth. In our glorious battle to win American independence, George Washington. This is the state where generations of tough and strong New Jersey craftsmen and dock hands, farmers and factory workers built this country into the single greatest nation on the face of the earth. And we are making it greater and greater every day. It will never be better than what's coming. There'll never be anything like what we're doing. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help and your devotion, with your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of New Jersey, place I love, the best is yet to come. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. New Jersey. Thank you. Thank you."
Trump,"Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be in North Carolina. We had great, great luck and great people backing us in North Carolina. And I'm thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots. You are great people. Great people. I don't know how many people here, but there's a lot. We said let's keep it down. They didn't do too good a job, but that's good. That's good. Now these crowds, I tell you it's beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot. This is the most important election we've ever had. 56 days from now, we're going to win North Carolina. We're going to win four more years in the White House. This is a choice. And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades. I don't think you has a bigger difference and maybe you've never had a bigger difference. This is the American dream and the other, I don't want to say it because I'll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there. But the other is a basic disaster for our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children's future to countries like China. Remember this, very simple to remember. If Biden wins, China wins. It's as simple as that. So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now we've opened it. And by the way, your state should be open. Your state should be open. Any governor that does that. And even if you look statistically, it's you it's Michigan, it's a couple of others. They're closed. New York. Look what they're doing in New York, what they're doing to our beautiful New York. It's so sad. But you just take a look at what's going on in North Carolina. They want to open. They want to open. They want to open in Michigan so badly. They want to open. They want to have football. They want to have their schools open. And it's a shame what's going on. And I'll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open. They're doing it for political reasons. They're doing it for political reasons. They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, you're hurting the economy. Our economy is doing phenomenally well. And it's not only is it a V, it's a super V. You see what's happened. We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million. It's down to 8.4%. Nobody thought that, 8.4. So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it. We're opening it up. And we will have a great third quarter. It's going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we're going to have a great third quarter. We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over. And this is that super V. But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody's taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven't seen. And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place. They're Biden people. They're Biden states and cities. They're Democrat states. If they win, the mobs win. You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal. Give me that food. Give me that. A woman sitting there, she wants to eat. And they come and they grab her food. They grab her drink. Nobody's ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. We're not going to let it happen. We're not going to let it happen. And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time. We said, either do it or what going in. We're going to have to go in, do it. Let us go in. We're saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day. Let us go in. I said, let us go in. We'll straighten it out in less than a half an hour. Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody. You saw that. He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently. He had other charges against him. And I put out, when is he going to be arrested? And they went in about 15 minutes later. And I'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go. All they have to do is call us. It'll all be solved very quickly. They have to call them. But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places. They don't know what the hell they're doing. If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win. He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn't mean that's going to stop. He doesn't, he will never stop. If they win, it's not going to happen, hopefully. Because this is not like a second place crowd. Let's face it. Are you seeing? Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out? That's why he left. Finally, he left his basement. He said we got problems. I don't think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it. They understand it. He doesn't. So I'm running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries. Because if we win, America wins. You know that. You've seen that. Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you've never seen. They weren't even broken. They were bad. They were bad from day one. Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%. In fact, I got it down to 98%. Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98. And they all said, no, no, it's got to be a 100. I said, somebody else could finish. We want to get home. They said, no, you've got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and we're bringing them home. We're bringing them home. These great, great warriors. People don't like it when I say that. Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we are very simply, we're doing it again and we're on track to have, as I said, the best year we've ever had next year. You just had the best year. You just had the best year of the history of your state last year. We've created a record breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse. He won't even know the difference. How's the economy? Not good, sir. We're in a depression. We are? What's that? Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that. And I've spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country. We've never had so many jobs. We're up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere close. We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that. Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they're doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country. You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order. You want to knock them down? That's fine. But you go to jail for 10 years. It was amazing. It was amazing how that stopped. And then they said, well, we'll do it easily. We'll do it through the process because they don't want to spend 10 years. You know, they'd look at it. They'd say not worth it. 10 years is too much. But the DC committee, did you see about that? They want to change the name of the Washington Monument. They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument. Now, we're talking the big stuff. They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there. But I said that was going to happen. Don't worry about it. You don't have a thing to worry about. If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala. Remember Kamala? She started at 15. She was supposed to win. Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four. It's like a free fall. You know what, people don't like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country. Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate America's borders, confiscate your guns. He wants to get rid of your second amendment. We're going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs. You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated. They want to build low income projects in the suburbs. They've been doing it. They've been destroying suburbs. We're not doing it anymore. Somebody said suburban women, how's Trump doing? But do you remember last time too? They said women don't like Trump. I said, I think they do. I think they do. They said women don't, and then we did great with women. And remember that great. Was that one of the greatest evenings ever? Four years ago. That was one of the greatest. But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better. Now we're doing really well. African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better. He did better with African Americans than we thought. He did better with Hispanic than we thought. He did better with Asians than we thought. He did really well with women. What's this all about? Ladies and gentlemen. And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016. You remember that evening? Was that the craziest? That was the craziest thing. And they thought, I think they didn't think it, but I'll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now. They don't understand. They do understand it. They do. Right? They understand it. Look at that beautiful dress. And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much. Beautiful. Like it. But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again. Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me. We're not shutting it down again. We don't have to. We learned about the disease. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. People don't realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China. We put a ban on China, heavily infected. And Biden was against it. Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit. It's clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win. They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like we've never seen before. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. And never forget, they're coming after me because I'm fighting for you. There's a lot of truth in that one. And they do come after me. They do come after me. They have more things to say about me. Every day, it's something. They said, you see the plane where it is? Sir, would you like to take the car? I say, why? I'm saying what? Well, I heard you had a limp. I do? I don't know about a limp. I don't have a limp. Hey, someday, I'm going to have a limp. I'll let you know when. You'll see it. No, they make this stuff up. They make it up. They make stuff. It's called disinformation. They give a phony deal out. They did it two days ago with the military. There's nobody that loves the military more than me. I was very lucky though. I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that. They were there. They were there. But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many. Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier. It was all made up. And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, you'd have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and they'd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it's treason or whatever else you want to call it. And it's a disgrace that it's taken this long. It's a disgrace that it's taken this long. And let me just tell you a little secret. Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden. Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don't you use the Logan Act on General Flynn? Look at General Flynn, what he's going through for years. If that were ever reversed, I'm telling you, you'd have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago. It's a disgrace, but let's see what happens. Biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities. And you know, he talks about like, well, he's going to do this. He's going to … He doesn't have any idea. He has no clue. He's going to do this. He's been there for 47 years. And he just really left. He left three and a half, four years ago. So he just left, but he's been there for 47 years. I'm going to do this. After 47 years, he's had a change of heart. This is the craziest election. This is the craziest … Look, somebody said, what's the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe? So the difference is the following. She's meaner, probably not as nice. I don't know. You can't get any worse than her, when you think. But the big difference is she's smarter than he is. Okay. He's a nicer person, but he's not smart. He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now. The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party's nomination. Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone. And by the way, you know who's further left than crazy Bernie? Kamala, Kamala, Kamala. You remember she left the race. Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California. I don't know. Maybe we'll make a play for that one too. But they picked somebody from California. I don't quite get it, but you always pick somebody that's hot. That's going up in the polls, going up. Frankly, I'm not sure. I don't think I've ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate. Right? Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot. He gave her a hell of a fight. A lot of people think he won and it got taken away. One thing about Bernie, he's the greatest loser I've ever seen because look, any children here? No not too many, but they've heard it before. He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again. Biden got the nomination. He got the nomination. But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas? She finally faded. She faded badly. But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee. And I don't know who I'd rather run against. One is super left. The other one's had to become super left. One is competent. The other one is only half competent now and heading south. He's half competent and heading south rapidly. But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense. That's why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over. If you look at that, it's over the law abiding areas that we have. Republican cities and towns are doing great. We're doing great. And we don't have crime and we don't have this violence. Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot. They're actually shot and killed. New York, the same thing. New York's gone through the roof. They were up 300% in certain categories. And you say, what's happening? And we want to send them in so badly. Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters. And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why? Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you're campaigning, you can't have more than five people. They- That if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people. They did that for me. If you are going to church you can't go to church anymore. You can't go to church. You can't go to church, you can't do anything. You have to stay in your house but if you're willing to riot, running down Main Street, if you're willing to riot and stand on top of each other's face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you're allowed to do that because you're considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I don't listen to too much, maybe I should. ""Sir, please don't say law and order. That's too tough."" Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy. They say, ""Say law and order but with safety."" I said, ""Look, people get it. It's just law and order, is that okay?"" We want law and order. They say, ""Law and order and safety, sir. Could you add the word safety? Because it's …"" I said, ""I don't want to add."" It's sort of obvious, right? We want law, we want order. Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist. By the way I've gotten the support of almost every police group in the country. Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina. All over the country, but did you notice he's starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that? He sees what's going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what's going on. Now he's starting to say, ""No, we need law and order."" No he didn't say that, did he? He'll never get to say that, can't say that because then it'd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party. You take a look at … You don't want to be dealing with the left. These people are stone cold crazy, you don't want to be dealing. Meanwhile Biden, he doesn't say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities. They're murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it. My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down. Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this. These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as you're sitting there. You'll be taking your monuments down. You'll be taking your statues down. I'm not kidding, you'll be taking them down. You have to look at the D.C. report, I'm just telling you, go get it, you wouldn't even believe it. It's too crazy to even talk about, but we're never going to give them a chance to do it. We're never giving them a chance. We're going to win, we're going to win big. This is a very important state, and by the way … By the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, ""Well I wanted to go and vote, darling. I wanted to go and vote. Why are they sending me those ballots?"" There's something really … The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, we're doing great there. Now the governor decides we're doing so well that they're going to send out unsolicited. You have solicited and unsolicited. They're going to send out millions of ballots to you. People that never really thought in terms of it. Now sometimes you'll ask for a ballot. That's a solicited ballot. It's okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it. Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots. Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts. Make sure it counts. Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things. That's the only way as far as the eye can see, but they'll correct it. They'll say, ""He's wrong, it was 14,500, he's misrepresenting. He's misrepresenting."" Now I was told we have 15,000 and we're in the middle of an airport someplace. It's a wonderful thing. I actually think … I don't know if you agree. So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren't working out too well, right? You can't really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we're rounding the turn on that but because of that … So we said where because we have the same crowds. I think we have bigger crowds potentially. We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport. We're doing all mostly hangar things because we're outside. Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right? But they say it's very much different. So we're doing these and we're doing the outdoors, we're doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago. It's pretty amazing. It's pretty amazing. We started off in New Hampshire, we said, ""Look, let's have 1,000 people,"" and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more. We're trying to be nice but then eventually we landed … Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean it's really amazing what's going on. All over the country, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's a great thing. More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, ""I don't know. That's a lot of …"" You know what? I've actually done more than I promised. Build a wall, build a wall, true. I've done more. For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force. We built, think of it. A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force. I never talked about that. That's something we never talked about. I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing. I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy. That was not easy, it was very hard. But what we've done … You know the wall now is past 300 miles. It's exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted. I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it. ""Sir, we have to be able to see through."" I said, ""All right, let's go. Much more expensive."" I said, ""Let's go."" So we're over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we've ever had by far and it's a good time to have it too. That's right. Mexico is going to pay for it. What happens if they fight us? Remember that answer? It's going to get 10 feet higher. Remember that. What happens if they fight us on the wall? The wall's going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great. In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country. Can you imagine that? 27,000, and I did that so that we don't put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple. I said you got to do it and the president's been great, he's a friend of mine, he's doing a very good job. Not easy, Mexico's not easy, but he's doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it's a tremendous wall. It's everything that the Border Patrol wanted. I gave them everything. I said, ""What else do you want?"" It's wired for every single thing you could have. Remember the Democrats, ""We don't want a wall, we want drones flying."" Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right? Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail. Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge. Now last night though, they arrested more than they've ever done because we said you have to. We said you have to and we told them about … We will federalize them, we'll do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like they're finally, after 107 days, like they're finally doing what they're supposed to be doing but we'll let you know very soon. Otherwise we're going in. The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide. Now you got to understand, Bernie's a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters. I think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade. They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, they're ripping us off on trade. I agree with him on that. The difference is I know how to do something about it, they don't. They don't have a clue. They just know they're being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that. That's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing. We appreciate it, we hope we don't lose it. Because we've really implemented things. We've taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China's never given us $0.10. It's a one-way street with China. They haven't given us … We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently. It's a great deal. They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they're smart, very smart. Instead of saying he's not talking very nicely about us and we're not going to order any more, we're not going to do business, no. Instead they do the opposite. They give us the biggest orders … Our farmers are very happy. Our farmers are very happy. Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers $28 billion because that's what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobody's ever done this before. Nobody's ever done this before. With Biden it's the reverse. His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he'll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all. Never happened before. Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them. So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice. Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else. Wait till you see the numbers. Wait till you see the numbers. You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying. I said, ""That's a big number, right?"" I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they're only lying if it's us because they don't want to be bothered. In other words they're not lying about Sleepy Joe, they're lying about us, and I don't know if I'm supposed to love that or hate it, I don't know if it's an insult or not but I will take it. We don't give a damn. If that's the case, we have a virtual landslide going. We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it it would have been terrible, but you know what? Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word. We had the call perfectly and if I didn't have it, somehow with these people I guess I'd still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthy's done a fantastic job. He really has. With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him. He's not too popular, I want to tell you, he's not a very popular guy in Utah. He's not too popular. So it was 52.5 to a half. He's a beauty, I'll tell you that guy. He couldn't get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now. Remember Utah, they said it's too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. Do you remember that like immediately? I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin. McMuffin, he was supposed to be second. Even Hillary beat him. What a group. Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan? Get out and vote for him. Get out and vote for him, okay? I'll tell you he'll be a great governor. He loves your state, he'll be a great governor. Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you're going to do well, Dan. I know you're really getting up there, it's getting very close. I'll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him. You know we had to take our convention away, he said you're allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you're not supposed to have political rallies. I said, ""You know the money that your state is going to be losing?"" But if this guy doesn't open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn't open up your state, you have no choice, you're going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you'll be so good. Dan Forest, go and vote. The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O'Neill. Jim? Where is Jim? Thank you Jim, thank you very much. Good luck. Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots. I don't like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff. I don't like it. I look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless. Really, if they're going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless. Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win. We're going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we're going to win Florida. North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great. Thank you Michael. Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney. Where's Mick? Oh, I didn't know Mick was here. Look at him. What a good guy. Thank you Mick. We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff? We love Mark. Doing a great job. He's doing a great job, Robert O'Brien. Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert? 50, 50 and 0. We're 50 and 0 on hostages. We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that you'd never even heard of and it's been pretty amazing. Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here. Mick it's good to see you. Oh wait a minute, wait. It's a very, very outstanding senator. Oh I'm lucky I got to see that. We love South Carolina, right? Come here. Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones. Two great ones. They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey. That's good and Tim is another one. So we have just incredible people in the party. We've achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that's driving them crazy. We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses. Remember, that was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost – 53]. No, but it was a terrible thing. You'd pass away and your kids would get the farm, they'd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive. They'd put big mortgages on the farm, they'd lose the farm, they'd lose the business. You don't have that anymore. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster. For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back. Biden supported NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Think of it. But the big deal is, he's changed. He's changed. ""After 47 years I've changed. I swear to you I've changed."" Did you see him in the debates? He was not too good, but that's okay. He was better against Bernie. Something's going on there, I don't know. You know what I'm talking about. But he was better against Bernie. But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want. Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything. Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers. If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice. You believe it lawyers? This is what we need, is more lawyers. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. That's courtesy of Biden and his friends. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, it's been incredible. Everyone said, ""Impossible."" They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done. And it's a great deal. And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with… It's such a disincentive to do that. Now that was the thing that was most important to me. I used to hate when I'd see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they'd make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing. It doesn't work that way anymore. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. In the face of China's economic aggression, we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers. I will always stand with American agriculture. These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we're not going to let others take advantage of them. For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it's just been this way for 20 years. Now, it's going back up. I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn't do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy. If I didn't do that, I think you wouldn't have any farmers right now. Really. It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers. 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy. I said, ""Sonny, how much are they being targeted for?"" He said, ""Sir, $12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16."" So I said, ""28, okay, that's fine."" I said, ""We will give them 28 billion. They were unfairly targeted."" And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly. Oh, they want… And you know who else would like them very badly? Iran would like them very badly. Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion, in cash. And you know what's going to happen? They're just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes. Their GDP went down 24%. Nobody ever heard of that before. Their country is in trouble. I don't want them to be in trouble, but they're going to wait till after the election. When I win the election, they're going to come to us and make a deal so fast. Watch how fast it'll be. They're dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait. ""Let's wait two months, maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe we're going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and we're going to make a great deal."" No, there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal, we'll make a fair deal with them. But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal. I ended last administration's war on American energy. Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters. We don't want to buy energy. We've done that for a long time, for decades and decades. We don't want to do that anymore. I like being energy independent, don't you? And I'm sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes it's below $2. You said, ""How the hell did this ever happen? Thank you President Trump."" Right? Thank you President Trump And look at your electric bills, everything else. These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times. The Green New Deal, it's called the green new nightmare. While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent. It should be for many, many years to come. Because the fact is, we don't have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel. We've been very good to Israel. But other than that, we don't have to be in the Middle East. We don't need… There was a time we needed desperately, we don't need that anymore. We have more than they do, isn't that nice? After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country. America first. It's America first. To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones. I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy. He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldn't do. And Biden. I call it Obiden. O Biden. It's too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden. And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded. And we're heading back to that level rapidly. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters. He betrayed them. Look at 1994, take a look at that. He betrayed them, what he did to them. He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing. They were all sent to Beijing. So many people went there. They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing. He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai. Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first. And actually, if we weren't interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere. And nobody has been through what I've been through as president of the United States, nobody. They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. I said, ""There's no way he got worse than me."" But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news. Maybe in his case, it was real. I can tell you, in my case, it's fake. It's totally fake. But nobody's been and should never be allowed to happen again. Let's see what happens. We caught them cold. Let's see what happens. But if we didn't have to… That takes time, and energy, and all other things. 31]. She could have said, ""Okay."" She could have said, ""You got me."" But she said, ""I got set up by the beauty parlor owner,"" who happens to be a Trump person by the way. I like the beauty parlor owner. She said, ""I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor. She set me up."" I said, ""How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China?"" No, it's terrible, she's always preaching about the mask. ""You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor. When you go to bed at night, put the mask on."" I've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I'm reelected the best is yet to come. I'll tell you that. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history. Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot. Remember they said, ""Walls are old fashioned. They don't work."" Really? I always say, and I've said it four or five times. I'll say it again if you'd like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years. If you're lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn't it? But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop. Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right? Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right? The wheel and the wall. Maybe I'm wrong, who knows? But I would say walls and wheels have a great future. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military we've ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91%, the highest satisfaction level in history. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem. And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades. Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement. Do you believe that? I said, ""Let me see that one."" Now we did something that nobody thought was possible. Man, it's Israel, as you see, and as you've read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East. They all want to come in. It's going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture. We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. Why didn't Biden get him?k They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him. The world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too. Soleimani. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades. We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home. We're bringing them back home from all these far away places. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it? Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldn't find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. Couldn't find him, they looked, they couldn't find him. I found him and we hit him good. We hit him good. And you saw the Mueller family on television. You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that. You should see it, it was incredible. Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world. How are we doing with China? We just have the plague, we've had other plagues sent by them. I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think? I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election. This was going to be so easy. I probably would have not been here tonight. I would have said, ""No, we don't have to bother. This is going to be…"" And now we have to work against a guy that doesn't know where he is, I can't believe it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Do you remember that? I banned it. Everybody told me, ""No, no, no, you don't have to do that."" But I said, ""We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they're coming here,"" so I banned it. Later on it was said to be a great move. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won't take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment…He didn't even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We're delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People don't know that because the fake news doesn't want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, we're producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we're going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something that's incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric. That's what they're talking about. So now they know we have it. It's only a question of weeks or a small amount of time. So instead of saying, ""That's a great thing. We're going to save lives,"" they're trying to disparage it, they're trying to make it politics. They're trying to do so. And now what's going to happen is we'll have it, and people won't want to take it. That's really bad. Okay? That's really bad. But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out, getting it out, and we're going to get it out fast. The vaccine will be safe. These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, it'll be effective and it'll be delivered before the end of the year. And maybe as I said, much sooner than that. Joe Biden's plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more. And that's what you're in right now. You're in a shutdown. It's crazy. I've been to many states, they're not in shutdowns and they're doing better. They're doing better. Somebody's got to speak to this man, Dan. Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan. Go in a little early and say, ""You don't know what the hell you're doing? You don't know what you're doing. They're hurting our people."" North Carolina has to open up. By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school. You ever see the statistics on young people? I don't know. They have a great immune system. Let's get some of that immune system, but they're amazing. I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they're not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%. It's an incredible thing. Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible. But young people are very strong against this horrible disease. Through our historic China virus relief programs, we've saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers. That worked out great. We provided $380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made $10 million in PPP loans to save- … And made $10 million in PPP loans to save your state's tobacco growers. We saved your tobacco growers. We have them very much in our sites. We want to help them. The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger. Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations. We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%. You couldn't build a road. We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we'll have it down to one. You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you're going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months. You're not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand. I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down. He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records. You wouldn't believe. I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is. He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country. Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world. Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships. And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone. He said, they're gone. And they've been incredible. In the second term I'll provide school choice to every parent in America. And we'll also take good care of our teachers. Our teachers are very, very important to me. Very important, nothing more important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just in finishing, I have to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We'll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We are going to bring our companies back home where they should be. I've been doing a lot of it, but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages, and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, surge, federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities. We will protect government benefits for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. What you're doing when you have all of these advantages, when you're giving them free healthcare, and free lawyers, and free college, and free everything, they all come. They didn't think of coming, but they see this, they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in. They want to come to America. You're just bringing people in and we don't want to do that. We want people to come to our country, but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally, very simple. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars. We'll build up our military like it's never been built up before. We need our military for other reasons. We will have the strongest we have now. When I took over, our military was depleted. We have a lot of military people here. Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old. Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles. And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that. But the best way of not having to use them is to have them. If you have them… We learned that in the school yards, right? We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them. We have the strongest military we've ever had by far. We'll end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which I've already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st. You better elect me North Carolina. I did price transparency and I've cut the price. Drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody's ever seen favored nations. So we did price transparency, kicks in January 1st. Could you imagine if this guy's president and your prices start to go way down, hospitalization, doctors, you can choose your own doctor unlike with Obama, right? Price is going way down, January 1st. I said, couldn't you start it sooner, but statutorily that's when it had it start. Could you imagine if this guy's in and prices start dropping like a rock? And they'll say, What a great president he is. He would have never done it. And your drug prices, prescription drug, I'm instituting favorite nations laws. So we're going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest. And you'rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world. We'll protect medicare and social security, and we will protect your social security. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Very exciting. And I will reopen NASA. That place was gone. They had grass growing out of the runways, you had to see it. Now it's the number one space center in the world by far. You see what's going on. We will restore patriotic education to our schools. Oh, you know what I'm talking about. Look at you. This is a very sophisticated group, Tom. You know what I'm talking about, patriotic education. Well, the first thing they do is they want to take your history away. That's a great group behind me. I don't know. They're activists. But you know what? You know what it means, they want to take away your history. That's why the monuments and the statutes, they want to knock them down. The first thing they do is take away your guts. It's guts. They take away your guts, they take away your statues, they take away your heroes. They take away your great generals. They take away your past. And I said, it was going to happen. I said, ""You know what? They started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of."" And I thought that was bad. And then they went up a little bit and now I said, ""Someday it's going to be Robert Lee, someday it's going to be Washington, someday it's going to be Lincoln. Someday it's going to be Jefferson, someday it's going to be Benjamin Franklin. It's all of them. They take away your past. They never taken away our past. That's the way they do it. You study it. That's the way they go. They take away your guts. We'll teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. This is better than the arenas, I have to say, especially when you have a crowd like this. But they're like this. They have such spirit in this country. People love our country so much. I went to Texas, I went to Ohio, I went to Florida, it's always like this. They love our country and we're not going to disappoint anybody. We're not disappointed. For years you had a president who apologized for America… So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I wouldn't say that lightly. And frankly, I thought the last one was, and I said it, but they've gone to a level that nobody even thought possible. These people have gotten stone cold, crazy. And you know what? After we get in, we're going to have tremendous success. And it was building. We were at a point, we were so successful before the plague came in from China. We were so successful that we were starting to get together. People forget. We were starting… Success brings people together. It was so good. Our jobs numbers were so good. And whether it was the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, our jobs were so good, our numbers were so good. We were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop. We had to close it up. We had to open it and start all over again. If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record. You look at NASDAQ, you look at some… We're far ahead of what I had planned. We're far ahead of schedule. But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event. So many people died. Nobody should have died, not one person. So many people died, but if we didn't do it right, we would have lost millions of people. Just a terrible thing. But oftentimes I say, bring people together. And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together. I was getting calls from, you won't believe it, Democrats. I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, ""Wow, things are going really well."" It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it'll happen again. There'll be great unity, eventually there'll be great unity. So get your friends, and get your family, get your neighbors, and your coworkers and vote. And I say this because it's from Charlotte to Kitty Hawk, from Durham to Asheville, and from Wilmington to right here in Winston-Salem. We inherit the legacy of North Carolina Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, one, two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you North Carolina. Thank you. "
Trump,"Oh, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And considering that we caught President Obama and sleepy Joe Biden, spying on our campaign, treason, will probably be entitled to another four more years after that. I wanted to thank you, and Art and Brandon, you're incredible. I've known you now a long time. Right from the beginning, we had the chemistry, we had that good chemistry… Oh, sit down. It's 122 degrees in this place. And we have our great Governor. Governor, can we make it a little bit, just a little. This is like a test. You think Joe Biden could do this? I don't think so. So I'm thrilled to be in Yuma, Arizona To proudly accept the endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council, that's a big deal. And they are great friends of mine. And we're building the wall. Next week, we'll be up to 300 miles of incredible wall. And our numbers are the best. We are very tough at the border. When people want to come in, for our farmers, et cetera, et cetera, we're not going to hurt our farmers, but we've never had better numbers than we have right now. And that's been helped because we're at a little bit over 280 miles right now, we have never been helped like this. Wall, there are two things, in a thousand years you can come back, two things will never, with technology it's obsolete before you even put it in the box, but two things never get old wheels and walls. Wheels and wall. If you come back in a thousand years, you'll say, ""Well, we still have wheels in walls."" And that's the only thing you'll recognize. The National Border Patrol Council is the official union representing the incredible heroes of the United States Border Patrol. They've been my friends from the beginning. To every border agent, and I just met some unbelievable people backstage, these are great people, and every family member here today, you have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation. And I want to thank you very much. Thank you very much. As you know, better than anyone, the survival of our nation is at stake in this election. And I will tell you, I never thought I'd say it because we had a great election. We had a great election a little while ago. Four years ago, I never thought I'd say anything could compete with 2016. This election that we're going into is the most important election in the history of our country, because we had crooked Hillary, but this is something, these people are sick. And we have to make sure that this radical left socialist and beyond, because this is beyond socialism, that it doesn't happen, or we will indeed have Venezuela on steroids. So we can't do it. Most important election, November 3rd, get out and vote. Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left wing movement that seeks the complete elimination of America's borders and boundaries. They want to take the wall down, they don't want to have borders, they want to have sanctuary cities, lots of bad things they want. Following orders from his boss. I guess his new boss is Bernie Sanders. Can you believe that? Crazy Bernie. Joe Biden has pledged to abolish immigration enforcement, suspend all removals, provide free government healthcare, and they want to give it to illegal aliens. You don't get it. Restore, catching and release. Shield violent criminal aliens. This is what they want to do. And give every illegal alien on the planet earth a free ticket to invent an asylum claim, and gain automatic admission into our country. We will have people coming into our country that never even thought of it before. You get free education, you get free healthcare, why wouldn't they come? Let's go to America. The Biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen. It's crazy. Biden's plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous, and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate. It must be defeated, and it will be defeated on November 3rd. It will be defeated. At last night's Democrat convention, which by the way, got very bad ratings, I have to tell you. Unity. They talk about unity. They want to bring unity. And then you listen to Michelle Obama's speech, which was obsolete by the time it got there. She taped it. No, she taped the speech. It was obsolete. She must have taped it about three weeks before. I'm speaking next Thursday, maybe I'll tape it. But I don't think that goes. That's so much nicer, to tape it, you do it, nice air conditioned room. And she not only taped it, but tell me when you hear a divisive speech… They talk about me as being a divider. I'm not a divider. I bring people together. We were bringing people together. We were bringing people together, like never before. Success was bringing everyone together, and then we got hit with the China virus, but we were bringing people together. But one of the opening speakers last night said that America will go to hell if we don't have open borders. Think of that. Go to hell. When a country doesn't have borders, you don't have a country. Today, a Democrat speaker at the convention said, ""We're talking about abolishing the police, we're talking about abolishing ICE, we're talking about abolishing prisons."" Biden's campaign has turned into a cult for open border and others Zealots. By the way, they want to double and triple your taxes, they want to increase regulations, they want to spend very little money on our vets, after we took care of our vets better than anyone's. 91% approval rate. And they want to spend much less on our military, we've totally rebuilt. Two and a half trillion dollars, we've totally rebuilt our military. Bernie Sanders declared, in his speech, many of the ideas that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream. That's Bernie Sanders. Because Joe, he doesn't know where he is. But if he did, he's been brought so far left that our country will not be the country that we know. It will have problems, it will go down. Your stocks will be gone, your 401ks will disappear. And right now, who has the 401k? And then the rest of you, many of you have stocks, and you do it a different way. That will go down 50, 60, 70%, 80%. And if you held on, like I said to do, we went down a little while we got hit with a virus. Now, NASDAQ just broke an all time record. SNP, just broke an all time record. Socialism is the mainstream of the Biden campaign and it's not the mainstream of America. Remember I said, we will never have a socialist country. On November 3rd. The people of Arizona, our great state, we love Arizona. I won it last time, by a lot. And I hear we're going to win it by even more this time. Don't forget, last time I talked, I said we're going to give you a tax cuts, I gave you. I said, we're going to give you a massive regulation cuts. Give you your tax cuts, I gave them to you. I said we're going to give you massive regulation cuts, we're going to give you great everything. We even did Right to Try medicine. You know all about that. We did things that I didn't even talk about it, we did. We did a thing called the Space Force. You never heard me talking about. I'm the only candidate that gave you more than I promised in the campaign. It's true. I'm the only one ever, maybe ever. Or we'll head to the polls and together we'll stop the left and win four more years in the White House. We're joined today by some incredible people, friends of mine, great, great people. And I want to congratulate your governor because we had a spike and he knocked that spike out so fast. I don't know. Are you sure you even had a spike? Doug Ducey, a great governor, great man, and a somebody that won by about 16 or 17 points. That's not so bad. And I think you're more popular today. What a job you've done. Thank you very much, Doug. A friend of mine and somebody who's a great fighter pilot, and I had a lot of people tell me she could really wheel the Warthog, right? The Warthog. She said, ""I love that plane,"" but she was a great, great fighter pilot, one of the best they were telling me. This was a group and they knew a very well. A lot of friends you have. And specifically she said, ""Could you extend that plane? That's the best plane. It never breaks down. It just is a winner."" But Martha McSally is an extraordinary person, and she's fighting for us, and she's helping us, and we have to bring her into the center. Thank you, Martha. And she's running against a gentlemen who is, when you read what he's done, when you read what he said about the second amendment and about all other things, you're not going to want to vote for. You're not going to want to have them play with your second amendment. I'll tell you what. If I weren't President, I don't believe, Doug, you'd have a second amendment right now. I don't think you'd have. The pressure that was put on to get rid of it, or to basically obliterate it, make it so it's meaningless. You will always have the right to bear arms. You will always have that. A few friends of mine who are warriors. Paul Gosar. Paul. Where's Paul? Paul, stand up. Will you? Paul Gosar. Thank you, Paul. Appreciate. Great job you're doing. These are warriors. They really are. When they went and they tried to make a play at your President, they had to get through the House. What were we? 197 and nothing. That's never happened before. Everybody came together. The Republicans came. Other than Mitt Romney, one half a vote. One half a brain. Another friend of mine and incredible fighter, and somebody that loves his state, and I'll tell you, the Freedom Caucus, right? And we have a man named Andy Biggs here. He's a fighter. He's a fighter. And he loves our vets, and he loves our military, and you love our second amendment, right? And we're not going to do anything with it. They will destroy that second amendment. Just remember I said it, but you're not going to have to worry about it because it's not going to happen. A woman who really distinguished herself, she became a star. She became a star overnight. There was nobody tougher. There was nobody smarter. There was nobody better than Debbie Lesko. Great job, Debbie. Thank you. We want her on our side. Right fellas? We got to have her on our side. Also, thanks to Arizona Republican party chairman, I knew this was going to happen. I knew that she was going. She never stops. She never gives up. Kelly Ward. Kelly, thank you. Thank you, Kelly. Great job you're doing. Are we winning? Okay, good. I think we are. That's what they say. We better win. If we don't win, this country is in big trouble. Big trouble. Also a great friend of all of ours, former State Treasurer of Arizona, Jeff DeWitt. Thank you Jeff. And a man who didn't choke under pressure. I don't even know if he's here. I think he might be here. He never choked. He kicked for 11 years. You know what that is? You ever see a golfer. They miss a three footer. They miss a three footer. They can't take it back. They choke, choke, choke. Well, kickers are the same. Right? NFL kickers. This guy lasted 11 years. He's one of the best kickers ever. NFL kicker, Jay Feely. Where's Jay? Where is Jay? He's here someplace. Where is he? Jay? What happened? You couldn't get a good seat, Jay. I remember the 61 yarder. That was a heartbreaker. Right? But the only thing is, I'll bet you this man would stand, only stand, for our National Anthem. That's one thing. That's one thing I can tell you. And if they don't stand for our flag, if they don't stand for our National Anthem, I turn off the game. Other than that, I'd like to watch, but I turn off the game. And by the way, I thought they learned that lesson a little while ago. I thought they learned that lesson two years ago, but maybe not, but they will. They'll learn it again. This time it'll go even faster. For decades, Washington politicians like Biden allowed an endless supply of illegal foreign labor to decimate American jobs and wages. Also, the crime was incredible what happened. They allowed criminal gangs to menace, maim and terrorize innocent citizens. They came in. They would maim and terrorize, and we have done something with our border patrol. And by the way, ICE, ICE is great. ICE has taken out thousands and thousands of MS-13, and you don't want the job. There's some tough people here. None of you want the job. It's a tough job, but they like it, and they're great Patriots, and they've done a fantastic job. They ceded control of the border to the most dangerous and ruthless cartels on earth. This is what would happen. They have ceded. And what we've done, did you ever notice the caravans? What happened? Debbie, there are no more caravans. What happened? What happened to the caravans? They don't come up anymore. The caravans don't come up. You know, we were paying hundreds of millions of dollars to Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, hundreds of millions. And I said, ""Well, why are we doing that?"" And they wouldn't take. When we caught a murderer and we wanted to bring it back to one of those countries, they wouldn't take him. And they wouldn't take him under the Obama administration. So we got stuck with them because they'd fly in. They'd say, ""Don't land your plane."" And I said something very simple. I said, ""That's okay. We don't have to do that. We're not going to pay you anymore. We stopped payment."" We stopped payment. It's amazing how that works, Doug. Right? We stopped payment and they called. They said, ""We'd love to take them. We'd be honored to take them."" So we take them back by the thousands, by the thousands. They let lethal poisonous drugs pour freely into our schools and our communities, but no more. It's not happening anymore. The cruel and heartless portrayal of the American people ended the day I took the oath of office, and now that we have more than half of the wall built, and do you notice they don't talk about the wall anymore. They don't talk. Why don't you talk? I went, ""Look at all those people back there."" That's called fake news, fake news. Look at them. It's the fake news. They don't talk about the wall anymore. See, we won. We got the wall. It's going to be up to 300 next week and it's going to be finished very soon. And as soon as we want, all of a sudden, they never talk about it. But you know where I talk about it? Numbers. The numbers are so good. The numbers are so low. We've never had numbers like this because that big portion of wall already built, you don't get through it. You can't get through it. You can climb Mount Everest, and you're going to have an awful hard time getting over that sucker. I stood up to the lobbyists. Everybody fought us, the Democrats, everyone. I fought the special interests. I kept every single promise that I made, and now I'm doing it with the drug companies. I just created Favorite Nation. So if a nation buys it for less and they buy it for a fraction of what we pay, the drug companies have to sell it to us for the same price. And they're spending so much. They're spending millions of dollars on advertising. Anytime you see an ad from a drug company, and they're rich, the farmer, it's called Big Farmer, the number one lobbyist. They spend millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars online. Anytime you see, anytime at all, you see an ad by Big Farmer against me, you know your drug prices are coming down. That's what it is. They're not happy. And we're giving the rebate that creates tremendous wealth for the middle man, the rebate. It's going to the people now. We're bringing the rebate and it's going to the people. They are not happy. I have a lot of people in that industry do not like me too much. But you are going to get 50. You are going to get, and the Democrats would never do it, Biden would never do it because he doesn't understand it, but they would never do it. They would in a million years, they wouldn't do it. It took a lot of guts to do it. I had a lot of people, a lot of good politicians go, ""Sir, I don't think you should do it."" I wonder why you're saying that, but we did it. We're going to have drug prices reduced over a very short period of time, by not 2%, and last year they went down a little bit, first time in 51 years that drug prices went down but a little bit, we're going to have prices dropping 50, 60, and even 70%. Drugs. About time. And I'm proud to say that they've achieved the most secure border, our border patrol, in the history of the United States of America. We now have the most secure border we've ever had and it's only going to get better. And we want people to come in, but we want them to come in through merit, right? And we want people- … people to come in, but we want them to come in through merit, right? And we want people that are going to come in and are going to love for our country, not hate our country. Here in Yuma, Arizona, we've invested over $1.7 billion and poured 180,000 cubic yards, that's a lot of concrete, to build 108 miles of powerful border wall. I know who's going to vote for me. I don't know though, I think I'm going to win Yuma. What do you think, Doug? I think, when I hear those numbers, when we hear those numbers, we're winning. We're going to win Yuma big. Now you see it and you see what's going up and it's an incredible structure, all capable, all wired up for cameras, for everything you can have. Technology is incredible. In total, I've already completely planned for the final execution, we're going to have, by the end of the year, everything that we said is going to be built. We may actually build some more in some soft areas that we've noticed over the last two years. So we actually may put up some additional, but we will have it completed, everything we said, by the end of the year and nobody thought that was possible. And we've reduced illegal border crossings by 60% since this time last year. And if we keep going at the rate, it'll be about 85% in about two months. So it's a great honor. And you know what? Your community is much safer, you see the difference, it's a much safer place to be. But more important than these numbers is the fact that we've ended catch and release. You know what catch and release is? These great men and women catch somebody, maybe a murderer, maybe a rapist, maybe a trafficker, they catch somebody, take his name, take his number and they release them into our country. And they say, ""Come back in four years, you have a trial."" No more. We take them out. We bring them out. And nobody said that was possible because I couldn't have gotten it through the Democrats because they don't like that. So we have people coming in to this country, some great people, some really bad people too. And I mean murders and I mean rapist, I mean really bad people and they don't get in and they don't get back. When we bring them back to their country, could be Mexico also, they don't come back. Under the Obama Biden, I call it OBiden, Under the OBiden administration, our agents were ordered to ignore the law and release illegal aliens by the hundreds of thousands. And by the way, Mark Morgan, where's the great Mark Morgan? He's around here someplace. Mark Morgan has been so incredible, one of our executives, he said, ""We never built the cages. Those cages were built in 2014 by Obama."" We never the cages, they were built by Obama and the fake news is constantly saying that I built cages for children. I didn't build them. They were built in 2014. There was a headline in Time magazine about the cage and somebody called in that built it. They said, ""He didn't build it, we built that for the Obama administration."" But they don't stop, they keep calling it, they say I built the cages. You'll hear it in one of the debates. They'll say, ""You built cages president."" I said, ""No, I didn't build cages. That was built by Obama."" Under the Trump administration, if you cross our border illegally, you are quickly apprehended and swiftly returned back home. We are proudly defending the job safety and security of the American people, which is what I promised to do. Nobody told me it was going to be this hard. Nobody told me I was going to have the Democrats go totally crazy. This was like a life and death war. You know why they don't talk about it anymore? Because they know it's bad politics, because they know having a wall, they can't win that one. So they just say, ""Let's forget it ever happened.' Because we won and they say, ""Let's forget."" They don't want to talk about it. That includes the millions of incredible Hispanic Americans who follow our laws, uplift our community and protect our nation, in uniform. Half of all border patrol agents are Hispanic Americans, I was just with them. And today I salute each and every one of those true American heroes and that's what they are. And nobody understands the border better than Hispanics. They know what's good, what's bad. They don't want bad people coming into our country, taking their jobs, taking their homes, causing crime. Hispanic Americans are the people that are most in favor of what we're doing on the border because they understand it. They understand it better than anybody. With the help of these patriots, we've stopped the rampant asylum fraud, shut down the human smugglers and we're finding the drug dealers, traffickers, predators, and we're throwing them to hell in jail or sending them back home. MS-13, for the first time that you've ever seen this, MS-13 is totally on the run. Many of its leaders are right now behind bars and we're deporting its members in record numbers we've never reported. I can't believe how many there are. But if Biden wins, it will be a giant jail break for MS-13 and vicious criminal gangs. China wants him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. When we win, I'll have a deal with the red within a month, watch, because they're dying to make a deal. But that last hope that Biden will win, they will own our country, China, they will own our country. We made such a great deal. Last week they had the largest order of corn in the history of our country, the largest single order. Then they did it again. You know why they're doing that? Because they know I'm angry, because they know I don't care so much anymore. We made a great trade deal, but I don't care. But it shows you how smart they are, Doug. Another with normal brain power, they'd say, ""Well, I'm not going to buy any more corn."" That's good. And we'll just decouple, thank you very much. But they go the opposite. They buy so much, good record numbers, soybeans record numbers. Last week, biggest ever, 42% of our farmers crop is now China, over the last little while. You know why? Because they don't want bad things to happen, that's why. So they're very smart. When I have every farmer in the country calling and saying, ""Please don't do anything."" They're very, very smart, but we can never forget what China did to this country and did to the world. The historic achievements that I've discussed today are only a slim fraction of the extraordinary accomplishment that we've all done together in the last four years. Here's just a short list of our landmarks. Really they are landmarks, true landmarks. We instituted a national security travel ban on the world's most dangerous regions, including jihadist regions, keeping terrorists and extremists out of our country. Everyone said, ""Oh, that's so bad."" Remember when they said, ""Oh, that's so bad."" I don't think it's so bad at all. We won the travel ban. The fake news said we didn't because we lost in the lower court, we lost in the second court and we won in the Supreme court. So they said we lost. Can you believe it? They said we lost Debbie, because we lost the first two, but we won in the Supreme court, so they said, ""They lost."" I guess, technically they're right, we lost when it didn't matter. But we have it. We have a great travel ban now for countries that are not countries where we want the people coming in. Over the last three years, ICE officers have made over 380,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of over 145,000 assaults, 40,000 sex crimes and 5, 800 murders. Over the last three years, border patrol and ICE have seized over two million pounds of fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other deadly narcotics. And you see it all the time. We stripped federal grant funding from deadly sanctuary cities. They want to have a sanctuary city, not going to be like the old days. We canceled the lawless policies of the previous administration and empowered border agents and ICE officers to do their jobs and proudly enforce the laws of the United States of America. We removed 20,000 gang members, including 4,500, MS-13. That's pretty good. Who would ever think there's that many? I entered into three landmark agreements with Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala to end the abuse of the asylum system. We cut down that payment that I was talking about substantially and they're still very happy and they are working with us very well and that includes Mexico. Right now, Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on our Southern border, helping us to guard our Southern border. And we're giving you the tools to do the job that you signed up for. That's what we've done. I entered into a historic partnership with Mexico, known as the migrant protection protocols, to safely return asylum seekers to Mexico, while awaiting hearings in the United States. You know about that. We had to have them in the United States and we captured them, we had to keep him here. I said, ""No, no, we don't want them here. We want them outside."" We got sued all over the place that we won. So now they don't come into the United States, they can wait outside. For the first time ever, the United States is now exercising our full legal authority to expedited removal. We don't have to go through years and years of litigation. You need Perry Mason to try and win. We ended the Obama Biden policy of giving work permits to newly arriving, illegal aliens. Think of that one. We established the national vetting center, the most advanced visa screening system, anywhere in the world. We know so much about the people coming in. We know the good and we know the bad. We've suspended refugee. … Good and we know the bad. We've suspended refugee resettlements from the world's most dangerous regions, because nothing is more important than keeping America safe. To me, that's number one. We've made historic progress to crack down on visa overstays. You know all about that. They overstay for years. They say, ""Maybe a night, maybe two nights."" Well, five years later, you catch them. No, we ended it. We issued strict sanctions on countries that failed to take back their own criminals. We have many countries beyond the four that I mentioned, the three plus one, many countries. They all take them back now. Before, they weren't taking them back at all. The last administration simply released these criminals. We're making sure they go home and we're making sure they stay home. We don't want them. We issued regulations to stop the horrible practice of birth tourism. You know what that is, right? Anchor babies, you know that, right? Anchor babies. Have a baby in our country and you stay for the rest of your life. Congratulations. You're a citizen for 90 years. Then you bring in your family. You bring in your family, right? No. No good. I implemented a historic public charge regulation to finally and fully enforce the federal requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient, they cannot accept welfare for at least five years. To protect our country and our agents during the pandemic, my administration took immediate action to ensure the safe and rapid return of all illegal aliens. We brought them back. We have very few in our country now. We brought them back, can you believe it? To protect US workers, I suspended the entry of low wage workers that threatened all of your jobs, American jobs, and we're finalizing the new H-1B regulations to permanently end the displacement of US workers. In January after the China virus, after the outbreak, after the outbreak, the China virus outbreak, it came from Wuhan, right? I swiftly implemented a travel ban on China and I was criticized. Biden, opposed the ban. He said, ""I oppose the ban."" He had no idea what the hell he was doing. Why do you oppose it, Joe? I don't know. They told me to say that. If we had listened to Sleepy Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional American lives would have been lost. We did a good thing. That was in January, I imposed it, very early. A month later, Pelosi and all these people said, ""Oh no, let people come in. We can't."" We imposed it because China was heavily infected. Then I imposed it in Europe also, heavily infected with Italy and France and Spain. Compare our achievements with the insane and lethal policies that Biden and Bernie Sanders want. The entire Biden… Harris. How about her? Is she a great one? Is she? By the way, you talk about guns. She wants no 2nd Amendment. She wants to raise your taxes to a level you'll be paying your government back for a long time. She is not the right pick, but she was my number one draft pick. They asked me that. Why do you think? I said, ""I'm very happy."" They thought I was happy. They thought I was happy for him. No, I was happy for me. The Biden-Harris plan is a step by step recipe for abolishing America's borders. In the Biden, Bernie manifesto, Joe Biden, promises to restore and expand catch and release across the entire US border. You believe that? We just got rid of it. Free all illegal aliens from federal detention and close detention facilities, this would make removing illegal aliens totally impossible, and you would have murderers, killers, rapists in your midst. I don't think so. Immediately suspend all removals, triggering a tidal wave of, really a flood, if you think, a flood all across our border. End prosecution of illegal border crosses ensuring that illegal aliens will repeatedly reenter the country over and over again and terminate all protections we have enacted against asylum fraud. They want to do things that nobody thought was even possible to contemplate. Now, this is all simple and I really respect because so far I've only seen about four or five people go down. Because it is hot in here. But I will tell you this… It's 120. You know what I said before? Think of yourself at a great spa, great sauna, where it's 120 degrees and we have to pay a lot of money to be there. You have to pay a lot of money. Getting off the border, getting off illegal protection, all of that, we are going to lower your taxes further. We gave you the biggest tax decrease in the history of… The biggest tax decrease in the history of our country. We decreased your taxes more than anybody has ever done and we're doing more because that's going to spell growth and that's what happened. Companies are moving in like nobody has seen before. So we're doing that. Massive additional regulation cuts. We've cut regulations more than any president in the history of our country, whether it's four years, eight years, or in one case, more. I told you already, our military is the best it's ever been. It's got $2.5 trillion worth of new, beautiful jets and equipment and rockets and everything. Hopefully, we never have to use it. Our nuclear arsenal, and hopefully, hopefully we never have to even look at it, our nuclear arsenal is at a level that it's never ever been before, and we have to have it there, but we never want to use it. So we have done things not only on the border, the border is one element, and to me it's very important. Something that they always say about a president, the most important thing a president can do is the appointment of federal judges and supreme court justices. So by the end of our, of not my, our first term, we will have appointed 300 federal judges and appeals court judges, and two supreme court justices. When it comes to 2nd Amendment, when it comes to life, when it comes to a lot of things that you people live for, if you don't have the supreme court and if you don't have the courts in your side, you can forget it. The next president, I think, will pick two, three, or even four justices of the supreme court. They can be on the court for 40 to 50 years. You pick them young. They could be on there for 40 to 50 years. This is going to be the most consequential presidency. This is going to be the most important, and I never thought I'd say it because of what happened four years ago, this is going to be the most important election of your life. So I just want to… Thank you. I just want to say stay healthy, stay sharp, be careful. Be very careful. Go out and work like hell. We need every single vote that we can get because it's probably going to be close. I always assume it's going to be close. They have these suppression, the fakers back there, they have the suppression polls where they interview many more Democrats than they do Republicans. Doug and I were talking about it and they take out registered voters. It's not registered. They say, ""Most likely to vote voters."" That's what, most likely registered, they're dead, they're old, they're not going to go, they're not going to do anything. Be careful with your ballots, but get out there. November 3rd is the biggest date, one of the biggest dates in your life, in many cases, frankly, it's the most important date of your life. One other thing we've done lot. We've gotten rid of a lot of nonsense from Obama, like the Paris Accord that costs us tens of billions of dollars and gave us nothing. We've gotten rid of so many different things that you have no idea, but you know what? If we don't win, they can put it back, and with the things that we did put in, which are many, many, many things, many things, our military, our vets, everything, with all of the things that we put in, it's like a tree, it takes a little while to grab on. You transplant it. It's got to grab on. If we have four more years, there's nothing that they can do. Our country is sailing. our country is sailing. So Yuma, thank you very much. Arizona, thank you very much. Thank you for all your support. We love you. We will never ever let you down. We will never let you down. Governor, thank you. Martha, go out and win. Go out and win. Vote McSally. Thank you everybody."
