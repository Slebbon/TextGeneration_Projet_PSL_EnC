The chair struck the pedestrian on the head, knocking her unconscious. When the pedestrian recovered consciousness, she found herself in a nearby hospital with a doctor in attendance.

A subsequent investigation revealed that the chair had, in fact, been thrown from a window at the hotel. None of the hotel's employees or guests, however, admitted culpability for the incident.

As he rounded a clump of bushes, he spotted a hiker, who, he thought, was a man wanted by the police. The hiker, who had his back to the hunter, was carrying a rifle on his shoulder. The hunter called out to the hiker to stop. The hiker was startled and, as he turned around, his rifle fell forward so that it pointed directly at the hunter. The hunter, thinking the hiker was about to shoot him, fired his rifle at the hiker. The bullet missed the hiker and hit a trespasser on the property. The hunter was aware that people often walked onto his land because there was a pond adjoining the property, which provided boating and fishing activities.

Now imagine that these bulbs are instead connected in series with each other. Which is brighter, and by how much?\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe brightness of a light bulb is proportional to the power it consumes. The power consumed by a light bulb is proportional to the square of the current through it. The current through a light bulb is proportional to the voltage across it. The voltage across a light bulb is proportional to the number of volts across the series combination of the bulbs. Therefore, the brightness of the bulbs in series is proportional to the square of the number of volts across the series combination of the bulbs.\n\nThe voltage across the series combination of", "Which of the following is a stimulant medication used to treat attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?\n\n1.

But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nWhich author was most critical of the policy being described here by President Jackson?\nA.
