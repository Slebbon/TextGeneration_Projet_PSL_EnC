The production fee clause also stipulated that the $100,000 would be paid to the production company \"on condition that the filming and editing be directed under the personal supervision of the president of the production company. \" The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the production company filmed and edited the ten campaign commercials, which the candidate approved.

But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nWhich author was most critical of the policy being described here by President Jackson?
